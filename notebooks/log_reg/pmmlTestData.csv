review,sentimentno problem with constant improvement i switched to chase once being approved for a car loan some ten years ago i just thought it was easier to make a transfer between accounts than make a payment ive never looked back before i knew it chase was my only bank the tools offered on app were not complete but still better than the rest for personal banking along the years ive been a part of the many changes on app and banking these guys are great at first it was annoying with partial app use in the weekend i always that that should not be done when perhaps the app gets most used whatever i actually look forward to the changes the last one were complete access is available without having to sign in again is welcomed its going to be hard for me to change banks im also a world traveler one day i can be in canada the next in casablanca morocco then a few days later the usa and few more more days in mexico  it was hard when i first starting banking with chase because of their fraud security it took a phone call and that was it want to increase the amount of funds using atm all it took was a phone call why is this important because in some areas i travel cards are not accepted as long as theres a atm i can get cash and pay for car rentals hotels meals etc a  limit will not workall to say yup i like this app,1i live  minutes away from the nearest branch and this app lets me do basically all of my banking  the main reason i stopped using local banks was lack of overdraft protection which unfortunately was a problem for my wife and i until she landed a decent paying job  being over drafted for bills should say we were having financial trouble but not allowing us the opportunity to deposit cash i made from tips the night before to catch it up and instead charging a painful  dollar fee was killing me  chase offers overdraft protection so it became a no brainer even though i live almost an hour away from the nearest branch  even considering this distance i usually dont have to worry about depositing cash or withdrawals just my paycheck being deposited which this app does beautifully and quickly with zero hassle  i can view my statements and every transaction quickly  it got old typing in my password all the time but since they added the finger print login its gold  i also have the security of knowing i should have a nearby branch almost anywhere we move when my wife and i finish school and hopefully get better jobs chase wont have to worry about us switching banks if they keep this level of service up and avoid punishment fees that kick the small man while hes down ,1i am very annoyed with this app i do like being able to check my balance and recent checking and credit card transactions but mostly i was looking forward to being able to use the quick deposit feature saving trips to the bank recently i received a ridiculously small check for  cents from some kind of class action settlement not worth a trip to the bank but i thought it would be a good chance to try the quick deposit feature it asked me to enter the amount and then to take pictures of the front and back of the check against a dark background without any shaky camera blur this took a bit of work but went ok only after that did the app inform me that  cents was too small for the quick deposit feature okay that was annoying but whatever next time i had a check from my employer for about  i scoured the chase website for information about quick deposit size limits but found nothing so i went through the whole process i entered the amount and the app then asked me to take photos of the check again only after taking the photos did the app stop me this time to tell me the check was too large of course it didnt tell me what the size limit actually is so annoying chase be up front about the check amount minimum and maximum and design the app so it will warn users before having to photograph their checks its such a simple usability issue and it needs to be fixed,0i dont see how so many people on the reviews complain about not showing current amount and how things are pending constantly yes people thats what happens in your bank account when you use it daily i actually enjoy the fact that chase shows my updated available balance even when charges are pending the exception for checking accounts would be if you were to go eat at a restaurant obviously pending balance doesnt include any tips yet so mentally subtract your tip amount from the available amount and there you go also for credit cards it can take a while for the pending to go away and available balances to show correctly but once again thats how banking works the only instantaneous thing would be if you were at the bank in person depositing or withdrawing cash obviously youre not since we are rating the cell phone app all in all for a bank app that easily lets me check my balances and due dates im very impressed ive been using the app for years and now will continue to do so as for anyone still questioning the apps capabilities due to pending or unsure balances if it bothers you so much then follow your own balances in a check book if you dont want to do that then dont complain about it,1you can do almost every function the full site allows you to do directly from the app the only recommendations i havethings i didnt care for are that if you get a fraud alert and your card is suspended you cannot confirm transactions as authorized from the app you still have to wait for the email from chase that can sometimes take  hours this can be embarrassing when waiting in line buying groceries with people behind you the other down side is that when you get notifications from the app you have to log in and take a not so ergonomic route to where you can clear the notifications so they dont show as pending on your home screen icon its easy to set up fingerprint login or disable it if you prefer to type in your password transactions all show in real time you can email concerns or questions directly to chase from the app and view details on your transactions even when they are pending overall this is a great app once last downside is that you cannot use the mobile deposit option if you have had an overdraft in the past year which is discouraging since the nearest branch for me is  hours away each way you would think that they would allow you to make deposits so you could avoid going overdraft,1i use this app every day its pretty simply laid out intuitive there are some things i wish i could do within it that i guess i could do on the desktop i never use a desktop like nickname accounts but for the most part i never find it frustrating and it works nimbly it combines my multiple personal accounts and business accounts in one app but separates them in different tabs so i get a discrete snapshot of my personal financial health and business financial health it allows me to mobile deposit checks to any of these accounts its a huge timesaver especially since the chase location  in walking distance of my home  is closing ah such is the oasis future of the walkin bank  lastly i really appreciate the ease with accessing credit card information particularly a rewards screen its very simple and i can even book a ticket quickly and another window one more cool thing about this app when i launch it it shows one of several set images of the city where i live and not just a bland austin skyline but shots of nest local areas pretty neat customization and way to make the customer feel that chase is connected to them personally i would really miss this feature if it went away more photos please,1i have been a long time chase customer and have been using this app for years as others have mentioned it is a pain to have to navigate to the alerts and message center i have several accounts and in the alert center it doesnt tell you which account the alert is for you also dont have a way to choose the default alert account i had an account for a nonprofit that i handled with almost no activity but this was the account that the alert center defaulted to instead of my regular checking which is what most of the alerts were for also as mentioned in other reviews the messages in the message center are redundant and  of the time the message center doesnt load so i have to go back into alerts then back into messages to be able to see the messages this has been an issue through many versions of the app one last issue i have is how many steps you have to go through in order to schedule a payment through bill pay you used to be able to schedule a payment very easily and intuitively from the home screen you now have to navigate through many steps i order to setup or see your automatic payments it is a huge pain when this very important features used to be very easy to use and now is not i am not all impressed with the app as it has lowered or lost a lot of its functionality since previous versions,0i dont like big banks and this bank is right at the top  i ended up with an account through chase through a third party regardless their app is very useful for balance review  the fingerprint access is very handy enough that i wish my favored banks were able to include this in their apps  using manual entry as a backup is convenient the layout is helpful and intuitive balance straight away the logic feature seems to always be in the upper right corner however i constantly find myself looking for it in the menu upper left i had a problem with fingerprint recognition but it turned out my case was dirty between the case and the phone rather than on the touch surface i dont really use it for much else outside of the balance review and ocd monitoring one nice tidbit for their websiteapp is the categorization  i think they spent too much time on  it though as the categories make too much sense that i become a conspiracy theorist no group entity government or business needs to know that much info about me  for my needs i think theyre move away from keeping incompetent bank staff every experience at their banks is horrible to improving their tech department is probably their best move three stars because their tech department is really striving for better service  the rest of this bank not so much if at all,1im not a technology gifted person im almost  and ive been using this app for over  years now the alerts are superb have no idea why anyone could have an issue with this feature they can be set to a txt and  or email as needed they can be set with a wide variety of parameters to notify you of a wide variety of situations i highly recommend taking the time to set them up twice i have caught fraudulent transactions within minutes of the fact the online deposit feature is great i never have to stop at the bank  transferring money from account to account is as easy as it can be and instantly in the receiving account  i pay  of my bills through the bill pay feature on line and with this app without one issue this is a very powerful app and as for performance the developers have really done a great job at making a very reliable product i do recommend that if you use this app install the updates i do recommend this app to my friends and family the only way i think they could make this app better is if they could figure out how to make my phone spit out cash like the atm im kidding about that but not about this flawless app,1i love the check deposit feature this actually made me open a chase checking account i used to just have their credit card the only downside is the  limit but i really dont have many checks that hit that limit everyone who is whining about their paychecks being too big to go through mine is too thank you please enter the st century and get direct deposit the person to person quick pay is actually not quick at all it works well for situations in which you will have repeated transactions with the same person but not just paying a random friend once in a blue moon this is due to the fact that if you dont have a chase bank account they make the person you are sending or receiving money tofrom go through a drawn out account setup which involves verifying  small deposits made to your bank account this makes it impractical for one off use  however once you complete the initial account setup its actually pretty easy there after so if you pay or get paid from someone weekly or monthly its definitely worth your time to set it up and better than sending a check overall this app and chase is far ahead of the services provided at any other bank great job,1i just got a new bank account with chase and was really interested in the mobil app i guess they can say what they want to on the cermecials about this app and how good it is and how easy it can make you banking if it worked i downloaded the app and used it for about two days and now for over a week now i get  can not connect to chase at this time please try laterwhat is the point of all the perk advertisement when the product is crap i run on an iphone with the latest updates and have tried restarting my phone nope didnt work then i deleted the app and then reinstalled it to see if that worked nope another failure this is my first bank account in over four years since the recession i dont trust any bank institution until i absolutely needed one and chose chase for all of the perks i have read the reviews about the updated issues that everyone is having and all of the fixes that they are trying to do and noticed that chase wants the customer to upgrade to the latest ios typical of a bank they cant take responsibility for their own problems and blame someone else that like buying new tires for your car and they put big rig tires on your car and blame you for not having the right car that fits your tireschase you need to blame your tech support that you hired to develop your app and not you customers phone im about to shut down my account due to the lack of not taking care of their own responsibilities,0great simple app though i probably dont use all the features just use to check my balance and review statements i use on my ipad mini loads full statements for review much better than their fraught website  chase for some reason discontinued their autobill feature with fidelity so i have to use this app every month to get my balance and set up manual payment in fidelitythis app makes that easier though wish chase would reactivate the autobill function been having a major problem last few months with the app everytime i launch to use says i must reset password as too many login attempts plus if seems to have forgotten my ipad which i have used every time in the past to launch i have alerted cust svcit is very inconvenient to have to reset pw ith each use been happening for the past few months i use a vpn that may be an issue not sure everyone should be using a vpn so hopefully that isnt the cause of the problem waiting for the fix for thisupdateaug   still having password problems every time i open the app it says acct suspended too many login attemps so everytime i need to see my acct have to slog thru their reset pw process i do not have this problem with any other financial institutions app needs a fix,1ive been using this app for over  years now i can instantly check my balance transfer funds if im a bit short on  at the checkout line send amp receive  instantly and pay my bills in just a few clicks its fast secure and easyto the rest of you that had the audacity to give it only one star read the instructions if you cant deposit a cheque make sure you have verified the routing and account numbers and deposit amount if you are having trouble transferring  make sure you have the proper from and to accounts cant send or receive  make sure you have the proper email name address and if needed account  and finally to those that whine i cant log on fix it dont whine and give this app one star this is not the bank its an app people if the app is down chase is updating the software to keep you safe and secure is it a bit inconvenient of course it is however would you rather have instant gratification you moron or safe easy and secure bankingthank you chase online banking i havent had to go to a chase branch stand in line or so much as step foot in a bank for two years now great app thank you and keep up the good work  star app,1overall the app does what its supposed to i can see my balances make transfers and use quick pay so for doing the basics it gets a three a four star review would mean that the app does it extremely well displaying the current balance and taking into account all pending charges so that you dont have to do the math on credit card accounts for example would be helpful fully functioning touch id capability would also make me more inclined to give a four star review but mine only gives the option for touch id every so often at one point i was completely shutting off the app and bringing it back on but that takes some time while in the grocery store in the checkout aisle the capital one app knows that sometimes the prompt doesnt appear so they have the touch id option available to be tapped at any time in the upper right hand corner of the app i think chase could easily implement something similar a five star review to me would come after revising the visual elements of the app it seems to me that everything is too big and too distracting simple is better and while i think what they have now isnt too crazy i think it could be zenned out even more,1bank apps used by millions have to please a great many people that said i think this app could use some more focus i like the login screen generally simple with a picture and login info touchid is a huge recent feature i use every time once you log in you will have great difficulty knowing where to go next your accounts will pop up you can view account balances at a glance or click in to view transactions or pay the credit card off the sidebar menu is very complicated and takes some getting used to i dont use  of the menu options in there  no clue why theyre there i think there is a lot of work to do to make navigation simpler and to perhaps reduce some of the mental overhead of navigating the multilevel menu what are the  most common functions performed on the app focusing on reducing the number of steps to accomplish those five functions and making them as accessible as possible when you first open the app would go a long way to making this app a lot more userfriendly while easily the best banking app besides simple it still has some rough edges around navigation that need workthanks for the great app hope this review is helpful,1in my humble opinion not every single app is going to have fancy bells and whistles this app for instance is for someone to view the amount you have available whats already posted and when as well as whats still pending you can make check deposits by photographing the front and back of the check set up payments in advance set up payee information transfer money between accounts send receive money to from family or friends even setup alerts for every account you have yes the alerts do not specify which account to view for the specified alert but all you have to do is change the account your viewing with a simple touch of your finger its not rocket science people and if the alerts throw you for a loop then maybe you might want to turn them off i have been using this app for what seems like forever and  with the exceptions of when the site is down for servicing and i need to transfer money in between accounts i would not complain if they were to put some bells and whistles but the app works appropriately for banking purposes  stars arent enough id give it  if possible thank you,1chase doesnt care about its small customers or their money i made a  transaction at atampt on oct th and my app told me that the money was gone from my account apparently  days later they put the money back and didnt tell me so on the th of nov atampt officially took the money out and it caused me to overdraft by  now my issue with this is if i use this app and have alerts set so that i know whats going on in my account why would you not have an alert that tells me when transactions dont go through and large amounts of money are made available to me again why would you not have alerts set up that helps customers know what merchants havent collected money so that a person knows whats going in and out so basically if i am not checking every single day im screwed and if thats the case what it the point of the app and the alerts i might as well stick to banking on a computer since clearly its not convenient to bank using this app chase has left a very bitter taste in my mouth now and i will not be using their services they dont care about me and their customer service reps were rude about the situation and i also hate they they use non americans in their customer service call center i dont want to speak to someone from india about this issue  point is chase is officially the worst in my book and this app is useless,0this is a criticism if both the mobile app and the web page app this is the second time the app failed to transfer  there would be an extremely small font message i could bearly read saying there is an important message when i taped on it it pushed my transfer out another day when i tried to transfer the  for the suggested day the transfer button would not respond i was able to call there mobile support and get it transferred they were pleasant and helpful but i had to go through a series of questions this experience happened twice in one week a painmy criticism of the webpage for online banking is that they keep updating it the layout is completely different and it takes quit some time to figure out how to get done what used to take  min can take  mins like getting a payees address or editing a recurring g payment they also grouped the payees into clusters which could be helpful if one remembered how a particular payee was grouped it would be better to have a toggle button between alphabetized and grouped listings my big beef is that it takes a while to figure things out get up to speed then they suddenly update it again and change the layout all over the improvements are not worth the time spent on the learning curve keep the updates for security issues and have layout updates optional,0i love this app i have been a chase customer for many years originally a washington mutual customer before chase bought the company i was inclined to change banks when that happened because i wasnt familiar with chase but im so glad i decided to give them a try the app works great for me from checking all my balances on one screen to making deposits from home making payments from account to account to transferring money from person to person the only thing id like to see happen is it would be nice to see full account and routing numbers i have  different accounts with chase and cant remember all the account numbers so it would be nice to see more than just the last four digits i dont mind the extra password feature needed to get more in depth information on my accounts i understand its there as an extra security feature and dont mind entering my password a second time the touch id feature i love because i dont always have time to enter the password and is very convenient but nice to be reminded of my password everyone in a while so i do t forget it lol love this app,1this app is my main way of managing my finances but is unfortunately extremely unreliable regardless of whether i am on a wifi network home work public ive tried them all or straight up data lte it is extremely slow and works only approximately  of the time i will often try to log in and it will simply say an unknown error occurred please try again later or i will be in the middle of depositing a check and it will suddenly crash and say try again later the worst part is when it crashes midtransaction yet the transaction goes through multiple times this happened to me recently and resulted in my transferring double what i intended to another account this is unacceptable for a bank app as the transactions we make on here are important and we cannot afford to have them encounter errors so often i have updated this app multiple times and it has yet to improve i would consider that this is an issue with my service or internet but this does not happen with any of my other apps including citibank american express and countless other nonbank apps the layout and organization of the app is good and userfriendly as such ive given it two stars instead of oneplease fix the poor connectivity and crashing issues,0i live out in the boonies and travel often my husband is a truck driver and the app allows us to keep funds straight when set up up properly the alerts are zsuperb at alerting to transactions that my honey forgot to record easy to set easy to deposit easy to transfer funds without having hours of travel to the bank after big hassles with boa we have  + accts and plan on using them for business accts i am + and this is one of the only things i use my iphone for besides a phone easy to navigate even my dinosaur hubby can use itafter  update not liking app as much as before the back of check deposit writing annoying deposit by photo helpful so the + mile trip to local bank can be avoided i hate the week long wait to transfer funds into another out of state chase bank wth it isnt easy for me to try to calculate the delay and has caused my perfectly balanced accounts to screw up thinking of switching banks again they court you when they find you have  in other accts then kick you tothe curb if you dont put all in their banks personal bankers in nj fl and az nice  nj especially no brunswick branchwere great straightened out chase screwups yet again you can do better chase,1i think its so silly that people rate this app  or  stars based solely on their bad experience with the checks deposit system its a new feature with flaws as most new features experience so dont be so quick to judge i love this app even before the deposit feature was released the interface is neat and easy to navigate and i always paid my bills with the app it is fast and easy for me to pay bills without a computer this app isnt all about deposits so overall it is a fantastic app i rate it  stars since i dont use or receive checks and so for all the other options that i do use bill payments and money transfers and statement summaries i can happily say its all great dont rate an app based on one new and not so perfect feature rate it overall including all other features you dont rate a game based only on its graphics do you you look at gameplay interaction storyplot etc to rate a game so if you hate the deposit feature or you only downloaded the app for that purpose only look at the other features and at least consider its worth  stars for the other goods,1honestly i dont remember how i got by before this app ive had it for a couple of years now and i use it for a multiplicity of things from simply checking my balances or reviewing statements to instant balance transfers and mobile deposits my favorite feature is balance transfer it happens to me all the time that i do not have enough funds in my checking account because i can instantly transfer precise amounts from anywhere i keep my funds in savings then if there is an expense i can transfer the exact amount directly to my debit cardanother feature that i love is the notifications i have set my app to notify me of any payments transfers or withdrawals of anything more than  this is also instantaneous so i always know what the waitress charged me before she even brings back my card this is especially useful in the even of theft i will know within seconds of the thiefs  first purchase both what he charged and at what business if hes at a restaurant nearby ive daydreamed about calling the cops and confronting him myself anyways definitely get this app,1most everything works in the app not always the easiest to use or missing useful features which still requires decent amount of web banking log in my biggest and longest problem with the chase app is the alerts feature i have  accounts banking and credit cards if i receive an inapp alert the number of notifications immediately disappears when clicking on the alerts in the menu there is no indication in which of the accounts the alerts were for which means i have to open each account and try to remember when i last read an alert in that account  if there were alerts for more than one account i still have to go through them all to make sure i didnt miss any i have complained a few times about this before directly to chase in the app online and through the phone however despite many added features fixes and improvements over the years this issue remains just as annoying and useless as ever  instead of making it more convenient by not having to deal with dozens of text messages or emails i still have to use those text message and email notifications,1for an activity that can be inherently complicated the chase app makes banking as easy as one can expect  it is as intuitive as using a spoon although it is true that some activities require password entry even after logging in with touch id  minus one star for this even though im sure it is intentional for some arcane security reason one of the coolest features is that pending transactions are displayed within accounts not just the ones cleared  this allows you to see electronic activity almost immediately after you perform it but before it posts overnight  thats something your quicken online account updates wont show you i dont truly have reason to log in to my bank accounts very often but i find myself doing it anyway i thank the chase app for this  and fortunately this paid off recently when i noticed a pending debit card transaction for hundreds of dollars  the charge was fraudulent from compromised card data but i caught it within hours of the attempt thanks to a routine run of this app during a bored moment  score one for the good guys thanks chase,1i have been using this application for over three years while they have introduce some improvement each time they make a major update they reintroduce previous problems for example if the check doesnt go through because of an error it wont let you redeposit it because the application states that the check is already deposited even though it has not the previous update would tell you that a check wasnt deposited when it was furthermore its more difficult to take photos of the checks now because you get more errors stating the check photo is not clear enough when it is and used to be fine theyve also added extra steps to taking photos of the checks between the front and back photo now theres a dialog box that you have to answer this used to not be it seems like a small thing but its a hassle when youre depositing several checks and we have to extra steps it obstructs the workflow it seems like about one out of every five checks wont deposit so i have to going to the local branch if i have to do it for one check i might as will do that for all of them so whats the use of this application if its not reliable,0the remember me feature on the log in screen never works and as such you always need to re enter your login information every time you use the app for me ive found that if i re enter my login id check the remember me button again and then close the app immediately after the touch id feature works upon relaunching the app this is too much of a hassle and too much to have to do simply to check your balance you could log in much easier using a computer but then that defeats the purpose of having the convenience of the app in the first place there are many banking apps that at this moment all use touch id and this is the only one so far that has a problem with login it wouldnt be so much of an issue for me but after reading a lot of the negative reviews ive noticed that this has been an ongoing problem for quite some time and that chase doesnt seem interested in fixing it and that for me seems like a bad way to do business i think if chase really cares about their customers they would listen to their concerns and try to address them but it doesnt look like thats going to happen anytime soonso for now they get  stars,0compared to other bank apps ive tried chase has the best mobile banking app around easy money transferring keeps up to date as best is possible with your charges so you dont overdraft yourself and even if you do they are pretty forgiving whatever you do dont get overdraft protection thats how they get a lot of overdraft fees from you because overdraft protection allows you to overdraft your account without getting warnings that you have over drafted your account then its  each day your account is overdrawn they can try to do it even if you dont have it but all you have to do is politely remind them that you dont have overdraft protection and the best way they could make you happy is by removing the overdraft fees so you can get your account back in order also dont forget to set it to start reminding you i said after  but maybe  would work better for some one else that your beginning to get low on funds its worked for over ten years in my case i wish you luckone way or another best banking app ive seen,1i love what chase has done i am disabled and with this app i never have to go to the bank i am able to transfer money deposit checks and transfer money to friends for a dinner check all from my chase mobile app i also like the fact that chase bank honors american veterans i receive free custom checks a free safe deposit box and interest on my checking account chase goes above and beyond what any other establishment that i have dealt with to honor the american veteran they always call me by name if on the rare occasion i have to go in chase makes me feel like im part of their family instead of a number it is the best experience for a veteran that i have ever experienced they will continue to have my business as a matter of fact my son saw the exemplary service that they extended toward me that he opened his account there as well i cant say enough about them except thank you chase for caring about those who served this country job well done customer for life if you bank anywhere else then youre at the wrong place,1not bad but i have hard time to understand how does it works  i deposit in my checking account a certain amount of money and start calculating how much i will have left after do all the payments  so far all good but the craziness starts when i see the payment i make goes on pending and pending and so on until finally one payment clears  than next day another one etc so the amount i had initially deposited start lowering function of how many checks clears  than i start calculating to see if i have enough money left and yes i do  so im not worried to deposit more money but after couple of days i receive a text from the bank that i have insufficient founds  how  i just calculated and all was good  is very confusing with those pending  i have money on account my money just take as much needed and done deal in one day  why pending  than another issue is with depositing checks by taking picture with the phone  i love it but why takes so long to process them  so far chase is a good bank and the applications on regards to the fellow clients which are writing bad reviews  are easy to access  easy to understand ,1this is convenient and an app one would like to have but push alerts arent set up very well when chase sends you an alert it shows up on your home screen and notification center this is good however in order to viewclear an alert you have to log on and go through  screens and a drop down list only to see exactly the same message the screens you have to navigate arent obvious either the first time i had a notification i had to open every screen twice before i realized notifications are separated into specific accounts all you see is the red circled number on the more section of the home screen then nothing you tap alerts and see nothing youre supposed to view alerts history not to be confused with manage alerts then still see nothing until you select the right account for an iphone app the most fundamental and brilliant thing to do would be to at least add a notification button on the home screen of the app all on one page tap to reveal details and the pertaining account maybe a clear button since you already read the message before logging on,1its true and its an intelligent move on the part of the people that manage chase because they know that taking care of one customer is taking care of millions of customers and thats why i have remained a loyal chase customer for all these years once i had a fraudulent use of my card recently and chase bank took care of my needs immediately and right over the phone having the ability to check my money in their iphone app is very convenient and in this case a great way that paid off its safe and reliable in fact coupled with applepay its going to be my go to payment method because chase and apple have a completely secure method of using applepay so that the cashier doesnt even see my card so no more chances of anyone checking out my card number and password i highly recommend chases mobile app it makes it easy to check on you accounts transfer money and well to do everything you would do online at home anywhere and right on your phone chase bank rocksthank you,1i recently moved all accounts including personal and business to chase in the interest of transparency i am at chase private client what i find lacking as compared to another big bank is the ability to view account numbers and routing numbers transactions on credit cards not just statements which are seriously outdated check images and details on transactions i also find annoying having to go into each separate business or personal accounts area in order to view the accounts within it i prefer to have a total list of all accounts or to be able to make the view customizable i also think that the calculated totals should show for pending transactions its easy enough for chase to caveat those rather than hedge and put dots in place of useful info love the quickpay feature and the fact that it shows to whom payments were made on the listed transactions also find transfers and payments incredibly simple aside from setup of autopay from a related account to a credit card another area for improvement,1chases mobile app is the most secure bank app ive known and used from the touch id only i can open to the very secure password options just in case i forget my log in and i havent had to reset my account at all with chase because of their tight online security and bank too and logging out after a certain point in time is a cool feature  navigation is simple and straightforward once you log in and to check my balance and add money is even simpler  i believe there is always room for growth in everything and i would say chases app area for growth would be its depth of field with scanning checks for account deposits  i know it takes the app a little bit longer than it should to read and scan a check even when the picture is in focus and the lighting is good  for example if a bank teller can check money for any sign of counterfeit faster than the mobile app can take to read and scan a paper check than theres room for improvement in this facet  ok thanks for reading guys and have a wonderful day,1being a chase customer for a decade im proud to say that chase is the bank to go technology means a lot if it is adopted as it advances and ive found chase right there as forerunner none other banks come even close to application deployment as does chase some of the banks that just hype as one of the most convenient banks have been a decade behind from web application ux either their developers are sluggish or their priorities are tedious but its apparent that you wont get any competent to chase least by now the mobile app is just amazing you may have to wait right there and think for a while what you are looking for you are able to accomplish almost anything from this simple yet quite sophisticated app when you are banking via any other banking app you gonna end up in less than ten features but with chase app u r experience the full desktop features what more to expect larger icons and bigger texts common you are banking from an app yet capturing the entire banking possibilities on the go im living it,1the only suggestion i have for you is to rethink the ux around the flow for taking pictures of checks with the deposit function  when i frame the check then tap the shutter button there is a considerable delay before the shot is taken  thats no good  then it continues in the follow up view that shows me the image for me to accept  why is that image so much smaller every time i use the feature i try to maximize the size of the check to help with readability but the image im shown afterwards has a  to  inch boarder around it  i finally noticed the demure but important note about switching to actual size which blew the image up to the point i was looking at a  x  approx section of the check  now i think i finally figured out what you intended and how you were approaching the task but a lot of folks are going to be confused by that  simplify and or clarify that process it needs to have a very straightforward feel about it and instead its cumbersome and cantankerous  thats no good  hope that was helpful  really great app otherwise,1i use to love this app was able to transfer money make purchases and track how much was in my account in real time however in the last couple days it has been the biggest pain to deal with purchases i made days or even as much as a week or so prior are being removed from my account late and then there are even times when they are removed and then completely erased and then removed again causing me to now be unaware of how much money is currently in my account and to go overdrawni pride myself on being good with my money and never spending more than i have especially now in the holiday season however in the past  hours i have gone overdrawn twice and had to remove over  from my savings to deal with it and the first time it happened i even spoke to chase and they said that they had done nothing wrong giving me some run around story about sellers late money claims and me not being able to manage my money the last one really made my blood boil however hours after the call money that had caused me to be overdrawn and that chase had said wasnt a mistake on their part was miraculously redeposited into my account sorry chase app but youve let me down,0simply stated this app works well without all the hassle chases mobile app covers all the usual financials checking account savings and credit card i use it to monitor my credit card account and it works like a charm im update in time to pay my bill alerted once payment has been received etc the app also has features like chase quickpay and mobile check deposit for people on the go with busy lives these features allow consumers to transfer money from there checking account to a business partner friend or family just by their email address they dont even have to have a chase bank account to receive the funds it transfers to the payees respective bank and mobile checking allows one to deposit checks using your cameras phone what more could the modern person ask for in a banking app well stability thats one thing and over the last few years the chase app has been the most stabile app in terms of consistent updates of features no crashes and very few hang ups with the service glad to use it thumbs up,1app is fine but i am furious that they force u to update the software  all the time  if you dont update you cant login  and their forced updates are not compatible with older iphone software versions  hello chase if you are going to force an update at least make it compatible with all software versions   so right now i cant access the app anymore  they are forcing me to update the app and the software wont download  their latest version is incompatible with the iphone version i am using  its total bs   so now i am forced to update my iphone software in order to access the chase app which i will not do  my phone is old and wont b able to handle the upgrade so i would have to buy a new phone i hate the last few iphone software updates and do not want to upgrade  when you upgrade your software version all the accessories you have purchased like speakers alarm clocks car radios can stop working they become incompatible because they were created under older ios versions your accessories stop working and now youre forced to buy new accessories and install a new car radio it can get very expensive  its absurd  all this just to keep using the freaking chase app   i think not  im moving to another bank  im tired of these nazis,0so this app works as its supposed to for the most part im able to view my checking savings and credit card account all in one place which is very convenient viewing recent activity deposits transfers etc is all pretty seamless ive used chase quickpay multiple times and it works flawlessly paying my credit card is a breeze and transferring money is even easier on the other hand touch id for log in will frequently turn off for no reason and im forced to use my password to sign in and turn it back on manually im not sure why its always turning off and its pretty annoying when it happens also im not able to view my accounts at various times of the day for some reason ill just get a na on all my accounts it does go back to normal after several minutes but when i really need to view my balances i cant do that generally i think this app works pretty well and im happy with it but these minor issues are starting to get on my nerves as long if future updates fix these bugs then this will be a much better app,1i gave the app a  stars for a few reasons first i have the finger recognition on my device but you keep asking for the password and its very annoying when i would like to get into my account with the quickness secondly its always running slow and i have installeduninstalled and reinstalled the app on my phone so im not sure whats going on with that thirdly you keep asking for a review i usually dont like to do this especially if its something that i need a little time to seeing in action you should allow us to make that decision so it doesnt feel forced next i dont like that i have to enter my password if i want to see the image of the check or statement i have already verified who i was upon first login since you make me enter it to view my account anyways finally the app over all if okay when it doesnt say that its unavailable i enjoy banking with chase i love that i can snap a photo of my check and deposit it into my account without leaving home i like that if i want to select the option to view my balance on the screen or if i want it to remain private,1i havent had any real problems with the functionality of this app it works when i open it its understood that typically on sundays the app is usually down for some period of time for routine maintenance other then that ive never had any issues with this app my only really critique has less to do with functionality and more with convenience when you open the section to find a bank or atm theyre listed in order of proximity to your current location which is great if youre just looking for the closest branch however often what im looking for is the most convenient branch located between my current location and my destination example the easiest branch to get to between my home and my work cause often im not leaving my house just to go to the bank the bank is a stop between home and a restaurant or concert or whatever so a map of all close locations would be helpful i usually end up opening a maps app to find a branch this criticism is kind of nit picky i know but the only reason i gave the app stars,1i must admit that since ive switched over to chase about five years ago i really havent checked out any other bank apps  but i think it says something that i have not felt any need to switch or to look at any other apps  in my opinion chase is the best one thing about the app that i would changewhenever i get an alert i had to go clear it out of the chase app but when you go to the alerts tab on the chase app you dont know which account it was for  i have about  or  accounts that im linked to so it is not worth my time to go browsing through trying to figure out which account the alert was for  now i already have received a text alert by this time so i know which account there is a problem for but this app does not take me to it so that means the alerts part of this app is kind of worthless to me maybe if they just changed app to sort the alerts in chronological order showing the most recent first that would take care of the issue,1this app is very handy and convenient i love the new update where i can log in with my fingerprint i can even pay on my chase credit card with this app some of the features i like and use arethe chase quickpay feature where it allows you to send money to other chase customers without having to pay for western unionsince i have multiple accounts i like the fact that i can rename my accounts it makes it much easier for me to know which account i am looking at because not everybody has all of their account numbers memorizedalso having multiple accounts is very handy i pay bills out of my main checking account and use my liquid account for everything else so when i pay my mortgage which takes a few days to come out of my account i dont have to worry about whether or not it has come out of my account yet bc i keep funds in my liquid account for my daily miscellaneous expenses i am able to transfer money between my accounts right from my cell phone on the appi have alerts set up on my account so anytime anything hits my account it sends me a notice therefore even if my account did get hacked i would know about it as soon as it happenedtheres also a feature that allows you to find the nearest atm to your locationi cant think of anything that i do not like about this app i use it on almost a daily basis to keep track of whats going on with my account i love this app keep up the great work,1works in realtime which i like pays bills quickly when available on the other end has stopped payment through customer service when vendor claimed they never received it also had card information stolen both mine and my husbands money was immediately back into the account when fraud was detected chase bank in general in  when it comes to the belief the customer comes first including disputing an item ordered paid for and never received after numerous attempts to work with the seller money was once again credited to my account while chase disputed the transaction quick pay works wonderful for my nephew to pay me his rent immediately from his  chase account only issue is the fingerprint working on again off again also doesnt offer alternative methods of signing in like through a pattern i also dont like that the information you see on a transaction is the same way it was + years agowhich is limited at best restricted at worse,1i dont have direct deposit since i figured i could just submit my checks from my phone however whenever i try this i keep getting an error message time and time again stating that the picture was not clear enough mind you i have an iphone  plus and have had phones for a few years now and know how to take nice pictures i make sure that im in good lighting and double check to make sure its steady i even verify whether or not i could read the check  which i can letter for letter and number for number the check looks perfect to me but something about the app just wont accept the picture ive tried this a couple of times and it doesnt seem to work it worked  out of  checks however when i had a personal check i tried that went through on the first attempt one of my company checks did get accepted so i dont know why the others havent and i dont notice this problem with personal checks its just frustrating because i dont like having to go to the bank just to deposit checks when i can do that from my phone,1the new update requires an ios  or above a apple update chase should be providing for all their customers not just the ones that are ignorant enough to continue downloading apple updates long after the updates began slowing your phone down and using outdated childish graphics to tell a customer to use your update to better protect their money is like telling a customer to come into chase bank once a week to protect his own money if chase bank needs my help to protect my money than what kind of bank are they if me not downloading ios  can be so detrimental to chase banks security what kind of real security do they actually have chase customer service means you should be servicing all your customers not just the ones that need you more than you need them i should not be told by a service provider which phone i need or which computer to own that way they can service me properly if you have even a single customer who is not comfortable with an update from another company dont make that update a prerequisite to your own update  i should be able to use my chase app without updating my apple ios therefore chase should make an update that can coincide with my present ios,0i do everything on my app i live in pittsburgh now  hours from the nearest chase  i put my cash money in the idiot bankcitizens  who take forever to do anythingthen transfer all but  to chase pay bills send auto payments to some deposit checks send money to the kids and business associates transfer funds to an external account transfer to my business account  my fav thing is the fast alerts my money is out of my bank before i pull away from the gas pump so i always know what i have in the bank  if i screw up and dont have enough in the account i can transfer from my savings or business while standing in line at starbucks boom money is there an alert that my card was used was so fast that a would be thief couldnt even get away from the register with the card its a little tough to find a cancelled check from months ago but recent ones can be found searching for a payment on the app could be better too but all in all a great app,1this app is extremely frustrating i think we all expect in  to have instant access and control over our bank accounts via mobile this is an easy task to figure out as countless banks have already done so however chase seems to think its acceptable to deny mobile access whenever they feel like it and they feel like it a lot for starters whenever there is an app update they disable all access until you download the update secondly you wont find out if the app requires an update until you take the time to log in third the mobile check deposit is frequently unavailable for no apparent reason fourth when the mobile check deposit is available it often rejects perfectly clear crisp photos for no apparent reason i often take the same photo  or  times until it finally accepts it the chase app developers love to keep updating their app but never address any of the long standing issues that i have brought up here i wish they would get a clue and make an app that is actually enjoyable to use so many others have made great apps its not impossible,0quickdeposit is very dangerous i used the app to deposit a check written out to me and it cleared  days letter somebody got a hold of the check and cashed it at a bank of america chase debited the amount out of bank account ended up with nsf fees  i have spent over  days trying to get to the bottom of it and chase is telling me flat out that there is nothing they can do about it i went to bank of america to track who cashed the check written out to me and they said that chase had to initiate the investigation because i dont have an account with boa spoke to chase and they refuse to initiate an investigation they have already done some research enough to get a copy of the check from boa and mail it to me but they refuse to continue the investigation to have boa trace it i loved this app i even recently opened a savings account with chase because of this app but now thanks to their crappy customer service i will now close all my chase accounts and i will make it my personal goal to have everybody that i know close their chase accounts also i have over  friends on facebook and twitter followers   that chase could actually make an endorsement claim from boa will now end up in s of thousands of ,0i cant say enough about how much i love this app there is almost nothing that i cant do from my phone and the comfort of my house without worrying about banking hours or even going to the atm for that matter it is easy to transfer money to anyone via chase quickpay  i pay my babysitter my bills i contribute money to birthday collections and flowers and baby shower gifts for work with a simple email to the person collecting money i can deposit a check its either personal or from a business in seconds i see and hear what other peoples banks offer them online and it is nothing compared to chase  thats just online when it comes to banking apps there is nothing that comes close most banking apps are really nothing more than a glorified way to see your balance and are very difficult to use i came to chase five years ago because of the easiness inconvenience they offered and it has only gotten better since then i cant ever imagine baking with anyone else,1ive had this app for a cool minute and i like it i really enjoy the convenience of checking in my money at any time by just logging in its fairly simple i also like being able to transfer my money between accounts and paying bills however there have been various times when the app glitches there have been various times when i couldnt login because apparently chase wouldnt allow it and it always needs to update i understand that apps need to update to fix bugs and glitches and stuff but just now i tried to sign into the app and it said sorry you need the update qu i think i should still be able to sign in and check my funds with the old version but whatever they need to fix things like that why am i blocked from signing in at random times it doesnt glitch anymore but i still need to complain as this review is long overdue i generally like the app as i am able to do what i need to do the things i dont like is when its doesnt work like it should so then im not able to do what i need to do but its a pretty good app,1ok so i dont ever write reviews but this app is the absolute worst banking app i have ever used and i dont think it will get any better unless whoever makes this is painfully aware have the developers ever even used any other bankingcredit card app not only is it incredibly confusing too convoluted too little information readily available but it is also very hard to navigate and not at all intuitive upon login half the screen is wasted on literally nothing its white while the other half blankly states only what is currently charged to the account every heard of breakdowns what about trying to navigate the statements chase seems not to care that you have to go digging to nowhere in other to find anything and even when you find it the information is so unpleasantly displayed or presented that you might as well just log in online the app is actually not much better than chases web login which is also terrible on a scale of  where  is id rather cancel my credit card than use this service once more the web login is about a  the app is an  seriously if youre on chases app team the app needs an entire redo,0love this app especially now that i can see my monthly statements  also love the way it can be setup to show me each charge almost immediately after charged in my notification center and works well in apple pay  wouldnt leave home without my iphone with the chase app the alerts keep me totally on top of all my charges  i use this cc more just because of the customizable alerts i do wish that when it gives me the ten day notice of payment due that it would also give me the exact statement balance due for the month not the minimum amount but full amount due  gives me neither but would certainly like in another updatethats the only flaw for me i guess one more flaw would be when it denies my purchase and wants me to verifybut does this through an email  im no where near my email when traveling and buying purchases from a service station  fortunately also i travel with another credit card,1i love chase and for a long time it use to be my favorite banking app i like how effective the check deposits were and i liked that if i clicked off of the app it would wait  seconds before signing me out so i could click around on my phone to get information to do my banking without having to sign it every time however theyve fallen behind the lack of fingerprint technology is very concerning i use it for all me other banking apps i also dont like the update in the direct deposit that makes you clarify that the numbers are accurate previously it just processed it and never asked me to clarify now i feel insecure about it and frantically double check because i assume they wouldnt ask if they didnt actually have issue with faulty technology in the pasta banking app should be about ease of use and security and the chase app feels outdated and not secure in comparison to the fast changing app advancements other banks are making still love the service i get from chase and consider myself a happy customer despite the app lagging behind,1ive been a member for + years when chase made this app i was so happy its very user friendly easy to navigate also you can perform basically every transactions through the app without having to go into a branch lots of faqs with detailed answers customer support is excellent plus if you send a question comment concern or anything else their response time is fast  if your a chase member and havent downloaded this app yet please do it immediately save your time gas money as well as frustration due to having to drive to a branch plus waiting for a member service representative to assist you with your needs i highly recommend this app to every single chase customer even if you havent become a chase customer yet open accounts download this app you dont have anything to loose except unhappiness with another financial institution that doesnt treat their members like chase does they make you feel important like extended family ,1overall this app is just fine for me i dont do much on my phone in regards to more complicated requests or transactions so i only use the app to keep a pulse on my balances one frustration is that i used to have a push notification set to give me my daily summary and the balance was never accurate it doesnt take into account my recent transactions from one to two days before so it used to lead me to believe i had more in my accounts than i really did ive completely deactivated the daily balance push notification now because it was pointless also i dont know if anyone else experiences this but whenever i first open my app and click on the line to input my password it glitches and the whole page drifts up into the corner and disappears if im in a hurry this is frustrating because i have to go the extra steps of completely closing the app and reloading it and as my phone is getting older its getting slower and this extra time it takes to load the thing twice drives me crazy otherwise this app is good it gets the job done,1this app has worked very well for me so far  i was able to configure my notifications so that the important stuff to me anyways was on notify while the other less important info was not bothering me  its a nice unobtrusive way to tell you what your bank account is doing  believe me there are banks out there whose apps either dont allow you to actually choose or they dont have an app at alli also like that the mobile app includes every banking activity that chase performs and that it is navigationfriendly  as opposed to being just a simple app that performs a few basic functions such as account summary and a nowyourintrouble notification lol  this app and its abilities will make it easier for me to stay on top of my bank account which can be tedious at times and i can easily lose track because i do so much onlinealthough i am getting tired of constantly being asked to rate this app when i already have,1i love the chase app i check it daily its a very useful resource with seamless performance i can deposit checks send money to other banks request money from any of my contacts regardless of who they bank with the chase app seems flawless to me ive never had an issue with it ive never had an issue with chase either my southwest rapid rewards card was cloned somehow someone got ahold of my account info and a card that they embossed and attempted to use at a gem store in pico rivera ca chase texted me immediately then called me as were fixing the first fraudulent charge they swipe the card again at the same store this time for  card limit they were some pros but chase was on top of it i had a new card the next day and all charges were refunded chase has never dropped the ball or come up short they remind me why i bank with them every time there is any issue because they handle it immediately love chase and love the app pyite,1i like this because its easy to sign in and check my balances i also use it for transfers from my checking to my savings and to pay my credit card after purchases so i dont get behind i can see any pending transactions so i have a good idea about whats been spent even if the store hasnt completed their end yet depositing checks is very easy since im trying to build up my savings now and have a few big purchases coming up i wish that the app was set up to transfer from checking to savings as easy as from savings to checking its only a few extra clicks but it used to be set up in a way that there was no default tofrom and now its defaulted as from savings to checking i also wish there was a way to categorize my savings some apps have a way to set up your own categories like house down payment or vacation but this chase doesnt have that option so i keep track of it on my own sure i can do it but it would be so much easier if it were built into the app we have the technology so lets use it,1chase mobile app is one of the best in the banking sector chase has been very innovative in their mobile banking approach and has set the standard for the rest the following items are suggestions for improvement and by no means detract from the merits of the existing chase mobile app  when an alert is pushed the user will receive only a number notification however nobody knows to what account this alert refers to the user has to go to the history of each account to figure out which account is the subject of alert it would be very beneficial that once the user clicks on the alert heshe is directed automatically to the account and the subject of the alert the app does not provide any information about a payment to card is posted for example if i schedule payment to a credit card several days ahead of due dated the app does not provide this information until the payment shows up at the payment day accordingly if a person forgets that actually has scheduled a payment the he will end up making two payments or no payments at all  the app does not provide an opportunity to provide any feedback to the developers accordingly one is forced to use the app review mechanism to provide feedback for improvement it would be very efficient if the app in the more menu include a link for the users to provide feedback on app performance amp improvements,1i am very pleased with this app since the update that fixed the ipod touch deposit problem  like others i had to find a setup to take acceptable check photos  it did not work in normal room lighting so i use bright daylight or a desk lamp right on the check and no shadows  i also put the check on a black surface and make sure the entire check is flat and inside the blue border  for me check deposit is a special convenience feature with bank system having to pattern recognize the account and routing numbers etc  i now do quick and usually successful deposits but i also understand that i have to use the old way if the image is rejected  with all the other features i give chase mobile  stars  note im glad it doesnt remember passwords  is there really a bank app that does  but a numeric pin shortcut would be nice if it had extra fraud protection to require full password if too many bad attempts,1new review looking sat this app functionality is okay transaction can take days to show up some even do not officially show up until delivery of purchase item when it is an appliance the minus is that i have to track my money there is no way to really have a realtime balance giving three stars this is comparable to other apps current review i tend to use this app and appreciated the previous functionality but as of today bank of americas application works much better i cant deposit a check to save my own life which is a critical feature why offer this on the app if it doesnt work it just shows how poorly this interface is tested for key features prior to updating this lack of functionality sets chase back to a solid two stars previous review i used to have problems with deposits online using the photo feature that no longer is the case the improvements in the app are solid and i appreciate its versatility if it could turn into an atm at whim id be both broke and beyond impressed,1words to chase app developers  too many screens before getting to most pertinent information but im sure the app covers several chase products  speed or loading should not be considered when providing customer pertinent information and cutting down on steps to get information is really bad it should give as much current and pertinent however i understand many products but maybe a first screen bigger snapshot with quick button choices   otherwise the i dont use touch id  i read some other reviews and so the app provides clear credit card balances and after as one of the other reviewer stating  digging i agree too many screens and steps also provides current transactions   i absolutely love being alerted immediately upon any transaction the reset was worth the hassle  i hope this helped both the fellow customers and app developers signed seldom app user use few chase products,1back when the app was all blue and simple was nice it looked so elegant and i felt good just opening the app this new one is too white and theres too many bright colors it was so simple before because the second you opened the app you could easily see where you wanted to go now all the colors and whiteness distract the eyes and keep them looking around the screen not being able to see what i want right away the log in screen especially when the app opens i see a picture and it distracts me from what i was on the app for with a business personality im always trying to find what i want right away without taking my time to enjoy pretty pictures id rather see a big contrast from the background to the login boxes and also the background to my account amounts like it was before with the pretty blue background and the white box with black numbers for the amounts in each of my accounts im not exactly complaining just saying that it was much nicer and simpler before the setup of the app has always been nice tho,1when i first got this app a few years ago i wrote a  star review best thing since sliced bread but it has been disappointing lately likely because o chases underlying fraud prevention controls which seem to be completely independent of the security and fraud controls on place with the app couple of exampleson several occasions my debit card was locked because of suspicious activity at a location fat from where i live couple of times i was between  and  k miles away couple of times i was a whopping  miles away my disappointment comes from the fact that not one time did my alerts which i have properly set pop up on the app to inform me of an issue customer support said that perhaps they are delayed nope alerts never came also i have my alerts sent for any withdrawals from my checking account over  they are instantaneous  something i noticed when hitting the atm machine but this morning when i noticed that a  check was cashed legitimately i was surprised to see no alert made on the app so great it will tell me when someone pulls out a couple hundred bucks but not k fix it and stop making excuses,0i have to use this app otherwise i wouldve had to close my account with chase where i live there are no chase locations not even atms so i depend on this app to work properly recently i deposited a mobile check like i do every week an error came up saying it did not go through and to retry later so i did exactly that tried again about  mins later come to find out the error attempt did in fact go thru and so did the try again later attempt i immediately called chase to let them know of the error and was told it would be reversed those funds stayed in my account for over  weeks apparently a bank person cannot reverse an error like that it has to come off at statement close it was pretty ridiculous not to mention i have been a customer from back in the bank united days on through the washington mutual days to now the chase bank days i opened my account back in s and now because i dont get direct deposit i get to pay a fee for my account i should just change banks,1i love this app i use this app daily to monitor my checking account activity it allows me to do my banking without driving  miles to the nearest chase branch saving me a lot of time   i was also able to catch a fraudulent charge that had been made to my account  just a day after the purchase had been made by checking my balance then seeing the fraudulent purchase listed on the app chase bank customer service reps were very helpful and fixed the  issue immediately     the chase app makes  my banking convenient easy and efficient the continuous updating and innovation keeps the chase app performing at a level which is top notch it absolutely rocks    chase customer service is very professional considerate and knowledgeable also they will do whatever it takes to solve any banking issues andor questions that you may encounter chase bank is a class act period bravo,1i have dealt with several national and private banks in the past years and i have to say that even for being a national bank i have never had a better or more positive experience and customer service as chase they have helped me with opening an account getting a line of credit and even spoke with me about some of their savings options not only that i have been able to link both the chase mobile app as well as the chase freedom credit app not once in the last year and a half of dealing with chase has there ever been a glitch with the apps not one and the touch id as well as the quick balance deposit and bill pay make it super easy and convenient to bank with them and even when ive had to deal with the bank branches directly i have had nothing but courteous and professional attitudes and quick service anyone thinking about choosing or joining a bank look no further thanks chase for being the best,1i love the convenience of banking anytime i choose its wonderful being able to make a check deposit day or night paying bills and the ability to make transfers within your accounts is the best feature the negatives not being able to see the picture of the checks debited from your account i dislike having to go back to my checkbook just to see who the check was made out to i really wish the rewards system was different the way points are earned on a quarterly basis for certain items or stores is difficult to keep up with chase should send a memo to the app users letting you know how the points are earned for that quarter i think they should be earned the way bank of america rewards are set up cash back on gasoline would be great it seems to take forever to find out what reward points you have earned that have been added to your account i do like the new app just wish they would add at least  more seconds before it times out,1ive been using the mobile app ever since i opened my account with chase and i have yet to be disappointed i switched over to chase because i was entirely fed up with my former bankit was like pulling teeth just to get my current account information their mobile banking app was horrible and i couldnt stand how awful the customer service and support was every aspect of the banking experience that was formerly lacking was immediately resolved everything i need to know about my account is available to me online or on the app and im so happy that i can deposit checks from my house whenever need be its so nice to not have to constantly worry anymore about what my available balance is or if im going to make it to the bank before close to deposit money overall im very satisfied and id recommend it to anyone looking to switch banks,1chase has seperated itself from the pack with the new remote deposit feature even though it can be a little tricky on some hand written checks if u just give it a few tries it generally works pretty easily the ability to make deposits remotely makes mobile banking truely mobile i assume most other major banks will follow suit in the coming months as this truely is the future online banks like ing direct would probably benefit the most from this type of feature yet their new and long anticipated app omitted this the only other future major feature i can imagine would be instantquicker transfers between different financial institutionsbut thats another day those of you reporting the deposit feature not appearing most likely have a nonqualifying checking account like chase access checking second chance checking once you qualify for a regular account it should appear,1i moved  years ago and the nearest chase bank is over  miles away i thought i was going to have to switch banks this app has been a life saver i can do everything from my phone i use it all the time and have never had a problem i monitor spending have an alert for account status and of course deposit checks all the time side note in the past  years the only problem ive had was getting cash i was buying a truck needed to make a major withdrawal i used another banks atm i know chase refunds their fee but chase did much better than that the atm was out of cash so it withdrew from my account and made the noise of dispensing cash but nothing came out i checked my account with the app to see if it really did take it out of my account it did i stay in view of the camera and call chase they verify everything and put my money back in no time thanks chase,1overall its greatonly had two problems the whole time i e had the app i used the quick pay a month or so ago my buddy from axle was sending me  thru quick pay i received email notification but never any other notice of any kind or the  i called the support line and all they could tell me was it was sent but funds woukd be available todayjust not now couldnt tell me when or why soi went to my branch after she made branch  phone calls she was able to find out the money department out a fraud hold on it no one could tell me that when i calledthen said it would be  hours before i could access it quick pay  whatever ended up canceling it and drove  hours to get the  from my buddy  days later i used quick pay to send my wife money same thing happened we have used it over  times before with no issues now suddenly issues everywhere thanksbut no thanks face to face business from now on for me,1i like the chase app can do most banking but what needs to improve is there find atm  branch feature when im on the move or in a new area i sometimes need to find a branch or atm when the app finds my location it will locate local banks and atm closest to me the problem with this is sometimes those options are not on my way to the location im headed to so therefore i need to find a bank in another area not necessarily the bank thats closest to me instead of coming up with a list of banks that i dont have any geographical knowledge of where there at a map plus a list should be available i know there is a map feature now but it only shows the one bank you currently selected if a map of all the banks were displayed or you could choose a new location to find a bank in that area i think that would be much more user friendly try integrating with google maps every time i try to find a bank through the app and use the maps system its very frustrating please up date this function on your app and you will then receive  stars regarding online deposit when you take a picture of your check it should automatically request you to flip the check and take the second picture since that is a standard practice for depots instead of having to click front then needing to click back this would make depositing much more streamlined and efficient thank you for your time,1story timeso when i was  years old i got my first real job meaning they could directly deposit my paycheck my mother took me to her bank  chase  and i opened an account with them i have since graduated high school deployed overseas completed my  year contract with the us army and began working in corporate america im now  years old and chase has been my bank through it all as a veteran i have plenty of exclusive financial institutions i can entrust with my finances but i have never had a problem with chasetheir ability to provide a seamless and customer driven product is evident in this app i can access my accounts with the touch of a finger send money to coworkers who bought lunch for the entire team regardless of who they bank with and can deposit checks without ever needing to leave my housethere is nothing wrong with this app which is a perfect reflection of chases business model,1i have been waiting for chase to add the fingerprint feature since the start of the fingerprint features so many other apps including ones for smaller banksalready had the fingerprint signon feature for a while according to my husband and friends my hubby has been trying to get me to switch banks by mentioning that he gets a  overdraft protection plan for free and that his bank must be more cutting edge because he can sign on to his banks app with his fingerprint he and i go to different banks because i have been with chase for a long time and i like my bank but those two features were starting to resonate with me cutting edge is the world in which we live and i happen to be in that world i definitely found myself questioning why something so easily executed was not being utilized so on behalf of myself and many of your customers thank you for catching up to the rest of us,1i downloaded this app and deposited a check and immediately i started getting push notifications to my phone that were visible for all the world to see because they showed up on the face of my phone about the amounts of money that were in my bank account it is totally unacceptable for the settings to be at a default where people can so easily see your deposit amounts and the resulting bank account balance so i had to dig through the push alert settings and find the problem to fix it then by the following morning i got another push alert that displays on the face of my phone declaring my bank account balance from a different kind of alert unbelievable so i had to dig through more alert settings in a different area to try to stop this i cannot believe that a bank would have default settings that make it certain that your account balance would be displayed on the face of your phone multiple times in multiple ways even worse was the fact that the solution was not only unintuitive but i had to go back again later after the problem continued to persist in a different fashion  its utterly egregious i expect much more from a bank,0ive had credit unions for most of my life because of being a local of one place but once i moved for college i had to get a big bank which i was skeptical of wells fargo proved my fear right and gave me the literal worst customer service ever along with a boatload of fees i was about to go back to cu but my roommate told me about chase this truly is the best place to bank at and i am glad i made the switch every service they offer is phenomenal and going into the branches for expert help is as easy as contacting their welltrained phone support teams the app makes the experience all the better with just about every service made available right in my pocket i wont consider any other bank at this point and plan to stay with chase for a long time if you are tired of big banks screwing you chase is different theyve got something going for them and i cant wait to see where the experience goes from here,1update  stars now looks like they removed the requirement to enter a password into the app to make a payment now you just log in with touch id and youre able to make your paymentlooks like there are tons of negative reviews on here for the bank not the app thats wrong this is really a nice app im even considering switching to chase because of the app my own banks app is horrible and background just a web view wrapped in an app first fantastic app beautiful and iphone native not some stupid embedded web view its quick and a pleasure to use second happy that touch id is  implemented thats awesome for login buttouch id doesnt work for making payments viewing statements and im sure  possibly other functions i only have a credit card whats the point of having touch id on some but not all functions previously i had to enter a password to get into the app then did not need to enter it to make a payment now i can touch id when opening the app but still have to enter a password to make a payment which basically defeats the purpose other than that this would be  stars if course as i post this i realize that apples own app store app wont allow me to post a review without entering my passwordeven though i can buy hundreds of dollars worth of apps on the store with just my touch id,1edit for weeks now it seems my business account deposits have been going to my personal account i called chase and its a known issue with no fix date available i cant use this app for business check deposits so its become much less useful for methere are too many clickthroughs to deposit a check i dont need to have the blah blah click to continue menu between taking a pic of the front and the back of a check also dont understand why it asks for the lengthy deposit electronically statement on the back of each check the check never leaves my office so no one else can steal and deposit it finally when it asks for the amount of the deposit i have to click done before i can start taking pictures because the menu set up has the keyboard covering the buttons to click for taking pictures i should just be able to automatically click the photos buttons love the convenience of remote deposit but its still user unfriendly,1i love the speed and transparency that comes with using this apps for most of my banking needs but there are a few issues first the touch id feature seems to only pop up when it feels like it second and most annoying when i get an alert i dont know which of my  chase accounts it pertains to but if i look at old alerts on any account the alert notification clears so i literally have to scroll through each account to make sure im getting all of the most recent alerts third why isnt my total credit limit viewable anywhere either here or on the browser version of chase online i literally have to add my current balance pending charges and current available credit to get the total credit limit and even then its not always right because some charges dont appear in pending until the next day so overall great app but definitely room for improvement,1i have been using this app for as long as i remember i have not visited a branch thanks to this app but since mid march i am not able to log in without resetting my password every time i tried to log in it says too many logins were attempted it lasts probably one to three days max and i have to reset it again too much trouble when i need to use it for bill payments sighupdatesi reset my password not within the app but on their website from my computer once i go through the process the issue seems like being resolved by itself so far i have not reset my password like before every time i open the app there was an extra step to reset the password on the website compared to within the app so maybe that was the reason for the problem i had if you have the same issue as i did i recommend you to reset your password on their website from your computer,1unfortunately there is not a lot of cool things you can do within the app i have used a capital one venture card and the capital one  app is way more versatile it has its own credit tracker section that allows you to obsess over little tipstricks and play around with simulating how to improve your credit score but also it gives you biweekly updated credit scores and you can view your credit score in a simple smooth way i will say that the pictures on the intro screen when first opening the app are very nice to look at and absorb unfortunately if you have touch id enabled you dont get to see it very long sometimes i log out of the app just so i can go back and look at the picture on the sign in page the chase slate card does let you view your fico but it is a lot more challenging to do you have to log onto the website and find the credit monitoring portal from there its not nearly as easy or convenient as the cap one app definitely could improve there,1this app has worked great everything i need to see is available and easy to find chase service is awful i disputed a charge and a week later i get s call from their overseas call center very difficult to understand and told me my dispute was denied i asked why and was told that i had to follow the policy set by the airline united to cancel a flight i gave chade all my documentation but that was still not enough the rep told me i had to have a doctors office letterhead notice for my illness as was explained in my claim being seen in the er made it impossible to produce a letterhead doctors office note i did not want to lie then the rep tells me the letterhead was the only acceptable document i stated again my visit was  hours and then admitted again the next day all documented the rep said no they require the doctors office letterhead between united ignoring my second and third request for a refund chases awful customer service and diagnosed with non hodgkins lymphoma it was a very bad experience i am canceling my chase card and my united account there are other bank cards that are very helpful and airline that have compassion,0its a little disconcerting that they advertise this app working with the ipod touch g because it doesnt work fully well the app downloads perfectly and all the functions work smoothly except for one which is tragic because this is the reason i bought the ipod touch for the coolest one  which is depositing checks its very upsetting i bought a new ipod touch g just so i could stop going to the bank since chase doesnt have that many branches in my area and its always out of the way from all my other errands  if you are buying an ipod touch g just for this app dont buy it until chase fixes the camera so its not messed up on the ipod touch and takes pics right and  all the bug problems that come with it in my case this app is really not worth using now aside for checking balances but who needs that when nowadays there are many ways to get account balances sent to you with out even logging in electronically to your account chase please fix the bugs with ipodtouch g its false advertisement if the app doesnt even work,0i have been using this app on my phone but as easy and convenient as it has been to use on my phone the pictures of checks for making deposits were taking several tries for a good usable pic  i thought i would give the app for the ipad a try and the app gives the option of filling the pic box or taking the pic actual size much easier to get a clear and complete picture of the check  i also use this app frequently to send quick cash to my sister out of state and have never had a delay or issue  i pay all my bills from this app too when i get a text reminder that i have a payment due i just take a minute to pay the bill right then so i dont forget  that way i dont have to pay ahead of time and i never pay late  this app makes it super easy and convenient if you have never used this type of service you dont know what you are missing,1many people seem to be coming here to review chase as a company this is the wrong place for that this review section is strictly for the appswitching over from the wells fargo app this thing is amazing i have more control and more options i can use touch id to sign into the app i can see my pending charges from this app a screen saver appears when you double tap on the home button to switch apps so others wont be able to view your bank account information by accident very thoughtful security features great app i think anyone complaining about the app simply doesnt have appreciation for technology nowadays this is hands down the best banking app on the market great job to the app development team at chase its unfortunate to see the app rated poorly because people are writing reviews for the wrong reason,1this app is definitely handy and i use it at least once a day despite the annoying bugs and clumsy user interface more detail ok first the good  i have it set to pop up a notification every time my card is used which is a great way to see what my family is buying and to monitor for fraud eg if i see a charge for our neighborhood grocery store i dont end up stopping in the way home from work buying an extra carton of milk its also useful for keeping an eye on bill due dates rewards etc  touch id is a welcome addition and it lets me set an ugly random more secure password  quick pay is just that quick and convenient good job chase and the notasgood  touch id doesnt always work about half the time it doesnt prompt for my fingerprint so i exit and relaunch the app which almost always brings up the prompt  the popup notifications i like so much build up in the app badge i dont need to be alerted in both places the phones notifications and the apps the badge should be used for other information the amex app does it right purchases cause popups for but no app badge  clearing that badge by viewing the apps notification center takes more steps than it should please put a link directly on the front page of the loggedin app overall this app is better than most of the other banking apps i use but theres lowhanging room for improvement,1app is generally fine but over the past six months or so it has become increasingly difficult to use every time i try to log on im met with an alert informing me that due to too many failed attempts at logging on my account has been locked and that i should call chase mobile app support i now know the drill all to well and phone support is always helpful butit is an incredible inconvenience to need to do this every time i wish to log on it means that whenever i wish to make a payment to chase i need to set aside time first to deal with app support on phone btw i have changed my password so many times and so frequently over the last few months that i cant even recall it to save my life i usually resort to copying it to my desktop or to my notes on phone for easy access umm this pretty much defeats the purpose of a secure password fortunately i have very little money so any actual hack or electronic fraud would quickly make itself evident the point is access is so difficult that it renders the app plainly inconvenient,0cant be more appreciative of this app complete convenance and security i use it everyday to track spending savings and forecast future spending online bill pay is the best thing the internet has ever given me no more envelopes no more stamps no more filling out envelopes or checks its all done with this app ive used it for at least  years probably allot more and have never had a single problem if i had a complaint it would be the tallying of pending withdrawals over a weekend or holiday they do seem to sometimes change their order on the next business day but once i understood that it was no problem to work with it i also enjoy the ability to deposit checks from anywhere the access to past statements and my bill paying history has come in handy many times zero complaints i highly recommend using this app,1as others have noted check deposit does not work on ipod th gen  it takes a picture but alignment is off  if i make sure the entire check is in the frame as instructed the top half of the resulting image is the bottom half of the check and the bottom half of the image is the table  its like the camera is looking further down than it suggests  i tried to adjust for this by looking up  after hours of taking pictures and i assure you some of them were flawless not a single one was recognized by the app  the errors were either it couldnt read the amount or some general nonimformative error  app also crashed half a dozen times while trying to make deposit work over the course of  hours  if the deposit feature were fixed i would ignore the infrequent crashes and give this app  stars  until that time all other functions seem to work great but do not waste your time trying to make the deposit feature work on your ipod,1since i updated my phone last week my chase virtual check portion of the app wont work it will take the photo but the use or retake buttons no longer work therefore it will not allow you to accept and complete the virtual check deposit as persoon noted in earlier  comments below when you tap the use button it simply zooms the photo and the button do no work i can no longer use this option to deposit checks very sadgetting so very tired of iphone and its garbage updates and tired that when i try to uninstall the app in order to reinstall again as told to do so by chase to fix the problem that app is in the icloud so it will not upload new app just uploads the same useless one i had before and just deleted from both my phone and my apple account therefore it cannot be fixed i choose not to use icloud yet my stuff still goes there against my will apple iphonesare really beginning to be one of the worst phones to have time to buy out my contract and move on,0i genuinely love this app it is amazing first of all it gives you the option of being able to swipe to the left without logging in to inform you of your account balances and if your not a fan of this feature you can choose to opt out secondly this application keeps up to date with current transactions including those that are pending within this app there are many other amazingly useful features such as the alert option my favorite of all the features because i chose to have the app send me messages if any transactions over twenty dollars are ever made and as soon as i slide my card for a transaction for  or more i get an alert of the total and place of the transaction this app is user friendly and if any question arises that the app can not help you with it provides you with contacts and locations of branches near by,1overall this app is very productive but    when there are alerts clicking on that section doesnt take you directly to which of the particular chase accounts has the issue  instead you have to click to the upper right amp guess which of your accounts had the issue  also as this area of the screen is too close to the log off button at times we have gotten logged off instead  same day payments via the schedule a payment tab made on the due date to another chase account have sometimes generated an alert notice the next day that your payment was late amp that a late fee was assessed  but then later that next day there is another notice that the late fee has been reversed  customer service recommended to pay instead via the account tab  however that doesnt allow you to follow the activity in the view activity tab for payments,1normally i do not review apps but this one was hard to pass up everything from the physical layout to the internal functionality is beautiful the font size is definitely larger in respect to the previous versions but i actually prefer it because it is straight forward and direct something most banks arent sometimes i dont check open my chase app in public places and i am usually in the privacy of my own space when i do but i can see the concern others have for their own safety and privacy because of the change however it does not bother me and the more direct approach of this app has hit a weak spot and i have yet to be confronted with bugs and glitches i love the new updateps im not sure if its the same for everyone but the homepage showing the sf trolley brings a smile to my face i feel at home in the bay area and this just brings me closer to it,1convenience is king amp this application is incredibly convenientalmost no downtime easily send money with quickpay quickly check balances get realtime alerts on accounts deposit checks without taking a single stepwith the fingerprint id getting into the application is as quick amp easy as opening it takes maybe  seconds and im ini use it just about every day amp i am ecstatic with the way the application worksonly one issue amp one complaint the issue the secure message center occasionally fails to load messages or takes a long time to load messages rarely gives me any problems personally so it is easy to overlook on my partonly complaint the feeling that i was browbeaten into making this review when the application asks if the customer would like to review the application upon opening the application it doesnt give the option to use touch id so either the customer must closereopen or just manually input the password it feels as though every other time i use the application it would ask me to review the application i understand that feedback amp reviews are important but not at the near constant inconvenience of the customer i would thinkoverall i would highly recommend the application to anyone with the caveat that one should review the application immediately instead of putting it off of course,1this app needs some work the account page needs to be changed from the safari view you dont need  lines of text to describe each transaction  you dont need the find us page already in another part of the app you dont need the contact us page same reason the buttons at the top are far too small to hit accurately but i assume you knew that with the size of the buttons within the application ive never seen so many asterisks on one page except for an mlb record book i know its legal mumbojumbo but maybe you could clean it up a little so this application stands out from the rest of your website cant tell you much about the find atmbranch button since i am in pennsylvania and all it says is no chase branches or atms found nearby fine but then show me where another bank or atm is so i can get to my money if i actually need it that bad no way to get back to the main page of the app once you have logged on without logging off,1like everyone else i was supet excited to try out the quick deposit you take a pic of the front amd back of your check and voila it gets deposited in your account i did this they even had me type in the check number and routing acct  from the check ok then i received an email stating that i had just deposited the amount of the check chase also tells you that after you receive such notification it is safe to destroy the check which i did fast forward  daysi receive a letter from chase stating that the pic of the check wasnt good enough and they are charging my acct for the amount of the check and a  fee what seriously so after your app failed i am being penalized for it i would like to see the conclusion to that commercial that chase put outthe one with the newlyweds quick depositing their wedding gift checks the conclusion would be that they open up the same letter i got and now their account is in the red thousands of dollars happy honeymoon thanks chase for screwing me over i guess you needed a new way to make money off your innocent customers,0i can literally do  of my banking on my phone deposits transfers checking balances paying bills what else is there i love that i get a check in the mail and i can deposit it immediately and generally have the funds available to me the very next day as long as it is deposited before pm eastern account balances are on one page with their quick view once you sign in the accounts are separated i have a business account as well as a personal account so one page for each account after you sign in but each page shows my savings checking and credit information for that account i can easily check my statements and look at payment information for credit cards and transfer money between each account ive used other banking apps but this one is the best i have had the pleasure of using,1after writing the  star review a month ago i am now changing it to a  star review in the last month ive had to reset my password three times and its not an easy process whatsoever in fact it stinks you cant use your previous five passwords a sign and number must be included it cant be common words and the most inconvenient part is that you have to know your debit card number ugh i dont know what has recently occurred the app used to work great and i only had to change my password once in a great while huh very surprised when i read the previous reviews ive been using this app for a long while and i find it to be incredibly useful yes you need to reset the touchid occasionally its my money were storing therefore i have no problem resetting security once in awhile ive only had to change my password once in years the touchid can be redone from the app so its not as though i have to go to a computer and log on there to comply i absolutely recommend this app,0this app has all the features and ease of use you can ask for the preview of accounts is something that saves me so much time and touch id has become a habit and i still feel secure even with those features chase really did their homework on what users want in a banking app quick access to view balances and payment dates and withdrawals per period from savings and you dont have to go more than one or two clicks into the app to touch  of what you will need to use it for on a daily basis love it and always recommend it to friends the app is and should rightly be winning customers for chasefeature suggestion change notifications to mark as read or pop up as banners along top of the home page of the app so the view notifications page is not buried several clicks in past the touch id login,1i love this app i check my acct almost daily making sure all moneys accounted for no ones made transactions on my or my daughters accts amp my checks have been deposited the only reason its not gettin the th star is i cant use any check deposit by takin a pic amp send like some have limited activity capability on sundays so not all transactions will show on those days i have had problems where my automatic deposit thatve been going on for since iv had the acct yrs dont show up for  days even tho it says pending im afraid to spend money thats pending amp its the rd of the mo where my rents due to be in the mail on the rd they could do so much more but i am happy with what they do have in place just wish i had more options especially since im now using a iphone how about the scanners for coupons pick up things like that help out on the debit cards but thank you for reading if you did chase,1the chase application is fantastic and is very up to daw on its updates one thing i continue to struggle with is the fingerprint entry mode it does not always pop up for me and recently it never does also chase needs to figure out a way to be able to use quickpay with all banks across the country there are applications out there all ready that allow you to do this and this is just a suggestion for chase to stay ahead of the technology boom that is happening other than that i would like to see a feature were you can pay your property taxes through the application and not have to go in to a chase store to do this even though i think it ie wonderful that chase bank allows you to pay these taxes through there company overall the application has been excellent for me and i highly recommend this to all chase bank users,1my family has been with chase my whole life so naturally i have a chase college checking account recently however i have been looking into opening a new checking account and a big thing for me is the banks mobile app i think if the following changes are made to the app i wouldnt doubt staying and i am sure it would make the chase app more competitivei like how pncs mobile bank app has a calendar that you can put in your scheduled pay days or when bills are due so you can have an accurate prediction of your balance to come and keep you responsible i also like how in pnc you can easily divide your money from your checking account into different sections for example if you wanted to buy a laptop you could make a section in your account and put money into it so you can responsibly save up for your purchasefinally i would like to have a more comprehensive way to analyze my spending similar to capitol ones app with the pie chart if these changes are added i wouldnt doubt staying with chase,0the application does what it needs to do for the most part the only thing that really frustrates me is that it used to show the transactions right when you click the grand total now if you look under credit card total you owe you have to click many buttons to find he transaction history i also dont like that it doesnt show you your previous total prior to the next transaction it just shows you what you charged your card for versus adding up the totals in a sub description box right below the charge they used to do all of this and then just took it away for some reason i thought it was much better before when you could just continuously scroll down and see what charges you made even if it goes months prior its nice having the option of looking by month but i dont want to have to keep clicking into sub folders to see my transactions when the last month was only a couple days ago,1the find atmbranch function only uses the ipods use current location function you cannot enter an address manually on wifi my ipod touch gets its location info from the isp which can be wrong by hundreds of miles i submitted a suggestion by phone to their design team and they understood that problem if they fix it it would also easily let me find branches amp atms in other locations  to plan ahead on tripspassword entry tip if youre having a problem with password entry try just using lowercase characters dont change your password to lowercase characters just enter it in lowercase chase says their passwords are not casesensitive so if you try to enter an uppercase character on the ipod touch or phone its possible the ipod is encoding it in a way that doesnt jibe with chases password function ive seen plenty of wacked encoding from all things apple before,1making deposits from the app is a real hassle if it doesnt like the picture of the check it makes you start from the beginning  of the time it rejects the photos even though they look perfectly clear on the screen before you choose use you have to enter your password or use touchid to access the app if you use touchid it is ridiculous to keep asking for the password every time you want to make a transaction or view your messages from the bank or view your statements obviously im logged in why do i need to enter my password so many times touchid doesnt work if youre dead or your thumb isnt attached to your body and sometimes you might be out somewhere with only your phone and you need to fill out a form for direct deposit or so someone can wire you money you cannot access your routing or account info from the app at all nor can you access it from safari on iphone ridiculous,1this app is great its very easy to manage pretty handy amp user friendly the only problems im having with this app recently is that it does not show immediately all my latest transactions it also does not show my paycheck deposit right away with a credit union bank the paycheck ach shows the day it was processed which is on a thursday so even though our payday are on fridays its already in any credit union acct on thursdays while with chase even on a friday it still shows pending almost the whole day why does it take that long and lastly is when checking my accts on weekend for which most of the time chase do their updates amp i needed to see what my transactions im not able to makes it very difficult to make some financial decisions when accounts are not accessible otherwise its been pretty good to me,1im sometimes wary that companies can put up pretty bad versions of their apps ive been pretty happy with chases mobile application   this is my second review as ive been using it since ios  it has a clean user interface very intuitive and most importantly very stablei primarily use it to check my balance and do online deposits which saves me from taking a trip to the bank to deposit checks for years now so far its been very reliable and no issues they finally added support for touch id which i think is a great idea but it has a little quirk it only seems to detect it when the app starts up meaning if you login and then log out and go back to the login screen it will not activate touch id you have to you have to close the application and go back in for it to prompt you  not a big deal,1this is one of my most used apps and honestly its one of the best on my phone compared to the bank of america app this is so much easier and straightforward whereas the bofa app is jumbled with a lot of extra stuff they had no where to put except right there in your face this organized app tells me everything i need to know and doesnt crowd me when i want to see what my account activity is however menus provide additional options for the infotasks you may need once in a while still not sure if you can contact customer service without having to log in to the main site but that doesnt bother me this banking app is superior to bank of america discover and barclay card easier less crowded and the touch sign in is always great the others have that too though i think chase is still the best,1june  update thank you chase for reinstating the fingerprint login the app has always been quick and convenient when the menu changed a little it still wasnt bad at all but now that the fingerprint option is back it is super fast to transfer money or do anything else love this appthis is a great app and it is very easy to use you can do transfers pay credit card bills pay house notes and even review your spending now the only thing i would say is that im not sure chase keeps up with transactions because sometimes you might see one thing and its not necessarily there for example you might see  in your account and it when i was was already taken out however that is not doing the app it is more with the bank itself all in all this is a great app,1this is the app to have for your jpmorgan chase accounts my state texas was converted from wamu to chase this past weekend july th i previously used wamus online banking for my checkingsavings accounts and chase online banking for my credit cards the conversion allowed me to have one single sign on to view all my accounts with chase this app is simple easy to readnavigate and it gets the job done couple this with the find a location feature and letting it track where you are through the iphones semigps g amp gs only and you have a quick find to access my money include a   quick dial and if i have an issue i dont have to remember a stupid phone  for help all in all this is more than i thought it would be after the account switches and i will be using this at least once a day now awesome job chase s,1overall this is a nice app however it is not real time it takes days for payments to clear it takes days for purchases to clear i find the whole thing completely frustrating when i make a purchase i want to be able to pay for it immediately because that is how i handle credit i dont buy what i cant afford but the apple only let me pay for what has already cleared the account that is extremely frustrating if i owe  on a purchase i just made i want to be able to pay that  immediately so that i dont owe it down the roadupdate this app is ok just ok its really frustrating when i need to switch apps and use a calculator app and i have to log back in again i realize security needs to be tight so that people dont steal your phone and use your credit card but its still frustrating also the only thing that is somewhat real time are charges payments do not process very quickly,1i love the app a lot but there are definitely areas to be improved when i see a sign for new alert the red dot and click on the alert option there is no red dot or anything indicating which product is giving me the alert so i will have to go to the alert of each product to find it i think it would be great to put all alert in one whole list and label each alert with its corresponding product the pay this card button should be added to the interface after i opened up the details of the card transactions usually i want to take a look at the summary of the monthly statement at this interface before i pay the bill however the pay this card button is only in the main interfacepage i think it would be more convenient to add this button to the detail page of each cardloan,1i like that i can transfer money over to any account and that i can deposit checks into my account but i hate when you purchase an item and it tells you you have more money than what is actually in your bank and suddenly you are over your limit i move all of my extra money into my savings account one particular time i had my account overdrawn because of two transactions that had not taken the money out though it had subtracted from my total yet the app told me i had more money in my account the next day i was charged with a   fee for both transactions so  for both for being overdrawn but i had learned about my account being overdrawn when i woke up in the morning moments after i received the fee luckily i was able to call and get my money back but this experience definitely upset me over all the app not being accurate is my only problem with the app other than that its a pretty good app,1keeps asking for password even though i have the fingerprint login setup correctly and working and they insist that you choose capital small letters and characters in your password i dont want to forget the password for chase because it is different than all my other accounts you should let me choose my own password and accept it without telling me you have to add a special character then telling me you have to have small and capital letters and like  characters long etc this is total bs and they only allow us to pay our chase credit cards from our chased checking account what if i want to use a different checking account i cannot add it and as soon as my checking account falls below  i have to pay fees and they give the lowest interest rate in the world for their savings account i will close my account first thing tomorrow morning i just hope they dont charge me extra fees for that also your app keeps asking for that huge password instead of the fingerprint every time i try to do any transaction from inside the app,0it has to be the phone or tablet that the negative reviewers are using i use this app both with wifi and my iphoneverizon data package i have an iphone  and verizon i live in a rural area and even though my phone is g my home area uses a roaming g network not verizon the app is obviously slower when using the g but still everything works the only reason i didnt give it  stars is depositing checks with the camera doesnt always work right i think that might be an appphone problem but more app because my phone camera is  mp and i would think the app and system would work with an even lesser camera otherwise i love this app my nearest chase bank is around  miles one way no atms either so i wish i could deposit all my checks every month instead of a measly k limit any rate i think chase led the way with this type of banking and i love it,1this app is very nice and the check deposit feature works great  there is only  feature that keeps me from rating this a start app map view for find atmbranchwhen you search for an atmbranch it shows you a list of locations along with an address and distance  you can click on the item to see where it is but that is not convenient  if you are not familiar with the area where you are searching which is why you would most likely be searching for an atm then you will not necessarily know where these addresses or streets are  a map view with pins for each atmbranch along with a pin showing where you are would be extremely useful maybe with different types of pins for a branch and atm  sometimes just because a branch is closer doesnt mean its easier to get tooadd that feature and this becomes a star app for me,1it is very nice and convenient to have this app and be able to have it alert me when certain things take place what i dont like is that the current balance number can be way off sometimes which ends in being overdrawn i took care to make sure that i could never be overdrawn when i set up the account i said to have my card decline rather than have it be overdrawn and yet it still happens and there are times when i dont even get that message right away so i can do something about it and even when i do i never carry cash on me so its not like i can do something about it at times which is inconvenient and has ended with an overdraft fee being charged which really angered me i think that the remainingcurrent balance system needs to be updated also sometimes the fingerprint password option turns off by itself and even if i go back in and turn it back on so i would also like to see that updated,1the best part of the app is the overview of all accounts that you can access by swiping right before logging in unfortunately you cant just click ontouch the account you want to access from the overview you have to log in and land on a much too complicated landing page where all accounts look alike identified only by personal or business my name which is the same on every accounts you have to click amp open each business account individually to see which one it is amp then identify them only by their last  digits i have many accounts so its ridiculous amp very difficult to find the account im looking for i actually have to go to my wallet to look up the last  digits of certain accounts or log out of the app amp take a screenshot of the overview it should not be this hard just make the landing page inside the app the same as the overview amp let us click on our accounts from there problem solved,1i was going to give this app a  star rating  it would have been  stars except that it takes many steps to pay your credit card while it takes only two steps on bank of america or capitol   not only do i have to enter my password it will not allow touch id but after i choose the date amount and account i must agree to the payment on three different screens  now since i pay my credit card multiple times a month this gets really tedious  but now let me tell you why i knocked two stars off the rating  when i said that i would rate the app later it began asking me every other  time i signed in  recently its request that i rate the app has started interfering with my ability to sign in with touch id  so that is why this turned from a  star to a  star review  if you are going to ask me later please ask me every  or  times i sign in rather than obtrusively annoying me every other time i sign in,0omg loved this app i cant thank chase enough for having such a great bank app is so convenient it saved me so many trips to the bank i am so glad it has the remote deposit features so you dont have to run to the bank every time you need to deposit then the quickpay feature is amazing i pay people i owed money to through quickpay without having to send a check through the snail mail i just quickpay them and they get them in their accounts in minutes chase has the modern technologies of banking and i am grateful for that i gave this app  stars because there is no app quite like this its very user friendly it doesnt stall at all it doesnt have errors because its a bank and chase app has proven that you can pretty much do so many things on this app that helps make your life so much easier,1id be nice if i could get a mandatory reminder to change my password quarterly and add fingerprint technology i used to really love the chase app over any other because of the real time activity now theyre back to there old stalling techniques where hold a purchase as pending its annoying i still bank with chase primarily because they have been number one for me in fraud prevention despite all that hype about target back a few years ago chase was on it before it long before the story hit the news my card was replaced twice just before the claim date target put out so hands down they can are number one for me they will call you text you email you until they get hold of you if they suspect fraud i only give them a  rating because im in wells territorythe closest chase to me is over  miles away so in house services arent available to me,1i switched from another bank and ive seen apps from a few different banks this is the best smooth animations and gestures that fit in well with ios  swiping to see my available balance is very convenient check deposits in the same app not separate and a really pleasing ui that blends in well with other good ios apps im very pleased all it needs is touch id support and were goldenupdate check snapshots work great i like this better than the other apps that snap the photo automatically the most negative thing i can think of is how you cant delete messages and how awkwardly the quick balance checking swipe animation works thats all overall a great appupdate  touch id support is sketchy you still get logged out after a while and have to enter your password why even bother with touch id,1this app is good except for the fact that i cannot use the quick deposit feature in the pictures for the app it shows four tabs one of them being quick deposit when i open up the app on my iphone however there are only three tabs no quick deposit also when i went to the website it told me that quick deposit is only available on versions  and later i looked at my version  thinking i simply had to update the app i went to the app store  current version  thinking maybe there was something wrong i went on to itunes on my computer  current version  i am thoroughly confused and hoping that this problem is resolved quicklyother than this single feature the app is great it is quick and easy to check my balance and it is a very useful app i just wish that the quick deposit would work,1this app is not good for those with vision issues the poor contrast and inability to adjust makes it very difficult to use  my mother is still not able to use the app  i discovered that i had an updated version when out in public last night and it bothered me how large my balance was written and it is difficult to maintain privacy  i want to adjust the font smaller for myself larger with high contrast for mom  cant do either  i spent half an hour on the phone today with a girl at chase trying to figure out how to see my account activity we finally figured out you have to touch the words available balance  half an hour to have the people that are supposed to be trained in this to help me figure it out  lastly as others have said the push alerts are useless because i have to go looking through every single account to see if there is a new alert  that is crazy stupid  still needs work and please consider making some effort to provide some ada compliant products,0i have been using the app for at least two years now used to really like it thought that most of the updates were unnecessary i have become kind of dependent on it but now i am locked out until i purchase a new iphone when i try to log in there is now a pop up advising me that i can not log in until i update to the latest version but when i do  the app store advises that i have to have os  to use the latest version of the app and then is gracious enough to offer to allow me to download the latest compatible version which of course i do but unfortunately it is not a recent enough version to allow me log into my account thats right after all that when i try to log in i get the original error message advising me to upgrade so until i break down and buy a newer i phone that can download and run os  i will just have to go back to the old way of banking despite the fact that the software version i have been using for the past two years has worked fine to make a house payment,0i have been using my chase app since   obviously chase is one of the top banking leaders in america and most reliable  the greeting with the   and  feature is cool but thats just a frill  chase was setting the bar high in  when they introduce the check quick deposit  taking a snapshot of a handwritten check with my phone and have an access to some of the funds immediately is incredible  it wasnt that long ago when i was rushing to get to the bank on payday before they closed  it rarely crashes and it seems that chases it department is routinely doing maintenance on their platform  if you want to use a bank that is forgiving efficient and fair good luck because youre screwedif you want your banks mobile app to work without delays and confusion this one would be the way to go,1sounds like others have had this same issue but ive had to change my password about  times in the past  months due to the too many login attempts error messageafter just attempting once to login with my correct password along with that issue is the touch id feature that will randomly turn off these time consuming flaws have made this app about useless to me because i dont want to risk not being able to log in so i now just go to the site online another gripe of mine is that you cant send a secure message from your phone hello such a hassle to have to go to a computer or laptop to send a written message the call center is useless they could tell me how to reset my password but im not an idiot i can figure that out with the prompts on my own they cant actually help you fix a real problem and had no idea what i was talking about when i mentioned how the error message keeps happening their app creators really need to fix these problems for the app to be usable,0this is a solid app for me and far better than the apps offered by citi bank both chase and citi can do the basic functions of looking at your balances making payments and seeing your transaction history the citi app for the ipad has lots of statistics as well a big plus for the app offered by chase is this it offers creative push notificationseven with the chase app not running at all i can receive notifications on each and every purchase i make including a  app purchase from the apple store within seconds of the transaction happening i get notifications when i pump gas eat at a restaurant or shop at a grocery store whether its me or my wife using the card this citi app cant do any of thiswith chase i can set thresholds to notify me when my account balances go over a selectable amount say  or  and i get notified immediately when a payment has been posted to my account or not as happened once  yikesall in all the push notification feature of the chase app has encouraged me to shift my daily credit card use away from citi cards well that and the fact that chases rewards program credits you a whole  value for  points where citi requires you to rack up  points for  value,1ive been using this app for a couple of years now its always been a reliable app for mobile banking i dont have anything to compare it to but im pretty happy with it at this point i havent noticed any bugs and havent had it crash on me yet i use it for online bill pay mobile check deposits and keeping track of my balance  all of which work flawlessly im thrilled with the addition of touchid to sign in and appreciate the fact that they are integrating new technology as its released the only improvements id like to see are  id like to be able to view pictures of cashed checks like i can on the computer and  id like full functionality for scheduling bill payments basically id like to be able to dump my computer for banking and be able to use the app exclusively theyre not there yet but theyre making strides im hopeful,1i have been with the same small regional bank since   i recently opened a small personal expense account at chase and the app came with it i love it i can deposit checks without going to the bank i can see at an instant all of my activity my old bank still has antiquated bookavailable on its website best of all i can see what holds are pendinga handy way to avoid overdrafts  i like the touch id feature  it took me a while to realize that if you enter your passcode incorrectly more than once i think it locks your account  no problemi just learned to type slower  the only improvement i would recommend is optimization for the i pad  i keep my i pad in a case and its a little awkward turning it sideways to see the app properly  not a biggieperhaps for the next update,1i really like having the chase app on my iphone it is so easy to check my balance while out shopping so i dont make any errors i dont have any issues using my thumbprint to open the app periodically i am asked to put in my id and password but since i chose both it is not a big deal to me i like that i can transfer money from my checking account to my savings or vice versa my only complaint is having to use my laptop to cash in points from my aarp visa instead of being able to from my phone since i am using a different device i have to call chase and get a password to complete the transaction however i appreciate the added security so it isnt a huge negative factor in my opinion i have been with chase for many years and even though i get offers to switch banks which will reward me to do so i plan on sticking with chase keep up the great work,1the only thing you need to make sure you keep track of are any checks you have written that havent cleared or if you have set up any automatic withdrawals you must remember what date they are scheduled to come out the app cant read your mind all debit card transactions and quickpays are instantaneous  no family or close friends should be caught without quickpay my friend was always complaining about having to run to the bank so i taught her how to deposit her check on your app she couldnt believe how easy it was and very grateful only wish the app could find someone to put huge amounts of money into my account so i didnt always need to micromanage my  balance this app is a great tool when you need to know minute to minute how much money you have spent good to pay bills out of too,1update two i pretty much only use this app to deposit checks it continues to be incredibly frustrating and often requires me to restart the app multiple times before it will finally go through its hard to trust that the deposit has occurred update how is this still an issue it often takes  or more attempts to deposit a check and even then im not convinced its worked depositing checks used to be almost fun with this app but over the last  months or so its become almost unusable i enter the amount take photos of the front and back of the check and then wait with crossed fingers hoping itll go through but  times out of  i get an error that the app cant connect or itll successfully perform the ocr on the account numbers but then report an error that its unable to complete the transaction however if i then navigate to the account screen it shows the check as pending after all but usually we dont get that far please fix this does not inspire confidence overall,0i love not going to the bank that is what this app does for me once i log in i go through the process of taking the picture of the front and back of the check and deposit it and it is in the account just as fast as going to the bank the other nice feature here is that you can update the account number if needed i have had a few checks when someones signature ran into the account number i always double check this before proceeding and a couple of times did have to correct it i have always had a great experience with this app as well as the website with its very easy online bill pay feature i would definitely have been lured to another bank by some special offer if it werent for the great app and online bill pay features,1i have accounts at several banks and just recently joined chase both my other banks one is a credit union have good apps the credit union has customer service that is impossible to beat but their online services arent very robust when i joined chase and started using the app i was surprised by how much better the mobile experience could be this app is easy to use dynamic and visually pleasing my only criticism is the alert functionality i would rather receive emails than red number alerts on my phone apps it is a pain to login and address the alert when im also getting an email there is a lot of functionality in the sidebar and the fonts are pretty small i like that the bank is mobile friendly but its a bit excessive i do however like that the app and the desktop views are themed similarly so the full experience is seamless great work,1its the most stable financialbanking app ive used chase has done a great job of making each customer feel like the center of their universe through the app alright that may have been a bit over the top but i like the customized background based on my current location the app does a great job at retaining the chase brandessence it feels like walking into a chase branch i started with chase because of the convenience of always having a branch nearby not so much in middleamerica but hey im never there much anyway ive grown to love them as a bank they offer consistently good inbank experience and that is replicated in their app the app is clean ie not cluttered easy enough to navigate fingerprint enabled and aesthetically pleasing i love the speed at which your transactions appear after ive purchased something in a store this helps me better maintain my balances by proving more accurate balance info i also set notifications for any purchase over basically any purchase the echeck deposit is as good as they come i just wish i could use the volume buttons to snap the pic of the front and back of the check i havent experienced any crashes when using this app very stable,1i actually love using the chase app when glitch that occurred recently was the thumbprint was suddenly eliminated it was so helpful but i thought they did away with it after a month or two somebody told me that it might have been a glitch because theirs was still working fine a few phone calls and a bit of annoyment and we were back in businessi wish i could get balance information on my second chase credit card as i can with my first one i can make a payment but can obtain no info also im really stuck on bill payne and wish someone would assist me in learning more about that feature overall its handsdown the best app for banking info as far as i can see even though i am a retired chase bank vice president i still have several bank accounts elsewhere but they dont hold a candle to thechase product dan,1i use this app when i am on the go and need to dosome banking  it works well  the only problem is their alert system  i thought they would have fixed this by now  if you have multiple accounts and one of them has an alert you dont know which account the alert is from  when you go to alerts to figure it out it opens up a random account not the main account associated with the banking customer  in my case it was my sons for some unknown reason  it took me a long time to figure out i had to go back and one by one open each account in alerts to figure out which account the alert came from  i hate having those alerts show up in my app button so i like to clear them out  it is really annoying and time consuming to go through this procedure every time i make a payment or go below my minimum balance  i wish they would fix this problem already,1the app is very easy to use i just got a smart phone and prior to that just had my laptop i always used the online url to see my balance statement and paid all my bills online i love chase bank have had my account with them for over  years amp have never had any issues that werent resolved quickly and cordially the customer service reps are some of the best anywhere the app does everything the pc website does so i love the fact that i can go into my account anytime amp anywhere on my cell phonethe only thing i dont like is not being able to see the full page of your statement at a glance the app zooms in so you only see about  charges or credits at one time otherwise to me its just like the pc website as far as i can tell overall i like it very much,1hey developers the ultimate rewards portal on the mobile app has major issues number  it keeps logging me out and not letting me see flights i tried three times in a row and it does it every time  first select flight details then hit search then it boots me number  trying to find a hotel is not easy every time you click into a hotel and then back to the list none of the filters or sorting are saved and you have to reenter them then to make it worse the filter and sorting pages are not intuitive  dont make me scroll all the way down and then hunt for the apply button way back at the top and then when you do hit book theres no way to know that it registered anything unless you scroll all the way to the bottom of the page from a usability standpoint please take a look and make this app easier to use i spent at least an hour today yelling at my screen for something that shouldve only taken  minutes,0this is a decent app which i use regularly but it has one very annoying flaw which is almost crippling when you tap the balance  for an account on the my accounts screen it will show among other data the current available credit which the information i most often need to see but only if there has been no recent posting of any payment or purchase which of course usually there is in that case only those postings are seen  and nowhere else that i have ever been able find is the current available credit for which i now must call the bank i dont know if anyone from the developer team ever reads these reviews but if so i ask them to please find a way to display this information prominently in fact it should be on the first screen showing the accounts and their balances  in my mind it is more important than the balance itself,1the app worked great my mom doesnt have a smart phone and needed to deposit a check into her account so i showed her how to log in and deposit it using the app on my phone mission accomplished and no problems there i made sure that it was selected to not save login info and after she was finished i logged out of her account however a few hours later i received an alert on my phone from the app notifying her that a withdrawal over her set amount had been madean alert that she set up to send to her email when trying to access the alert it opens the app and it shows that no one is logged in however the full alert can be viewed through the notification center and i just noticed that there are alerts listing her full account balance too this is not safe if this were my account and my purse was stolen the thief would know exactly how much money was in my account for them to steal once i log out in the app it shouldnt be sending any account info or alerts to the phone,0the good i like having my mobile app on the go it makes checking on my finances easy and convenient with things like bill pay and taking pictures of checks to deposit this app really does save a lot of time it also is really easy to move around in your accounts so if youre negative in one account a quick switch of money from here to there will fix that the badthe one thing i do not like about this app is that the system takes a really long time to update and get current with your ultimate reward points current balance and payments for example if my billing period is on the first and i need to pay money on my credit card it wont show me my updated balance for another  days so on the fifth ill finally have my current financial situation other than latency in that aspect this app is pretty cool ,1i seriously posted this as my fb status ive been with this bank for  years and this app is just the cherry on top it does everything no other bank even comes close in their apps you can deposit checks just by snapping a pic extremely easy to navigate and secure if you switch between apps it automatically logs you out i would give it  stars if i couldha i guess i never completed my review now with the ability to use touch id to log in its excellent to get a quick glimpse of your accounts if youre going to use the quickpay function youll need to manually enter your password once inside the app contrary to a prior review i read managing your alerts push email or text can be done within the app under settings then manage alerts,1as an old school person who was quite leery to its use initially despite using many other apps prior to use of this one this app has ease of use very adaptable and quick access with great efficiency all aspects of my banking experience has been great with chase and with excellent new generation options not available at my other bank or my credit unioni also dont find it a problem with the notifications as i found with another reviewer if you truly balance your accounts then one has a great idea what is available and what buffer they need in their accountif you dont balance your accounts then i strongly encourage you to leave an adequate amount in your accounts to cover any inevitable withdrawals which makes it easier to avoid overdrafts,1system locks you out of mobile deposit capability if your account gets overdrawn seems like a bad way to punish a customer for being overdrawn by making it impossible to put money in the account not a huge deal if youre near a branch or atm but in my situation i was three hours from the nearest branch on a temporary job location for  months and the customer service could not only not reactivate my mobile app explanation was it was an automated hold by the system but couldnt even tell me how long this temporary hold would last that it could be several weeks to a couple months i completely understand charging fees for an overdraft or bounced check but disabling the ability to put money in is ridiculous i left wells fargo after  years because of excessive fees and steadily declining customer service and chase has for the first time really let me down,1the app is overall ok i had accounts in another banks and used their apps and some were better some were worst this one is just okhowever for about a month now the online check deposit feature doesnt work i had an issue with it about a month ago i called branch and they said that several people reported the same issue over past few days i figured chase will fix it i was really surprised that a month later its still not working i mean i dont remember last time i did a check deposit other way then via app it is such an essential today and it is annoying that chase did not address it for a month was gonna give the app  stars but for the check deposit issue im giving it only  and now excuse me as i have to drive to the branch to deposit the check cuz this app is not working correctly for over a month,1when they released the touch id update i was thrilled  seconds later i was longer using it touch id only allows you to see your account summary something i can do without having to login to the app the preview feature allows me to ses my balances by swipping left without loging in which i love unfortunately with touch id you do just that if you want to transfer money use quickpay and or pay bills you must enter your password chase didnt really think this one through i would love to have full access touch id other than this issue its a pretty robust app i havent had too much trouble with it i like the way everything is organized for goodness sake please ease off on those inapp notifications its annoying i already get an email when sending a quickpay or making a payment there is no need to send me a message on that useless message center they have,1i love this app i have a few apps from other banks but this one is by far my favorite it is very easy to log in with my fingerprint and the backup manual login option is great too very streamlined and userfriendly i can view my account balances and transfer money into my accounts in literally a few clicks of a button as well as deposit checks through the app and pay bills through my phone overall it makes basic banking a breeze i can do it from pretty much anywhere at any time without having to go into the bank i save time and money there were a few close calls where i overdrew my account but transferred money in time after the bank was closed and avoided fees i highly recommend it you wont regret it,1the app itself is fine good basic access to your accounts the best feature though is the ability to scan a check to deposit it without having to go to a branch or it would be if it ever worked for me it only works about  of the time either it says the check image is not clear i have an iphone s not some ancient thing or it says the scanned amount is  instead of the actual amount this happened this morning thought the check was clear and the ink dark and legible and it even resorted to placing it under the light of a desk lamp on the third and fourth tries in case it wasnt bright enough in my brightly lit office full of overhead lights this is beyond frustrating when it works its fantastic but most of the time i have to take the checks for sometimes tiny amounts  or  for rebates etc all the way to the branch  please fix this feature,1i have many financial banking apps and this one is my favorite  it has the essential touch id login feature is secure amp so userfriendly  extremely intuitive as if it knows where you are headed next  i have investments jpm and carry the chase sapphire preferred visa signature card and jp morgan ritzcarlton rewards visa sig card i can manage my credit cards rewards and chase private client debit cards i actually prefer using this app over logging in on my imac w a manual password this quick fingerprint touch login allows me to access all of my bank accounts chase amp jp morgan credit cards rewards transfer funds make easy mobile deposits and this app has never crashed on me  i use this app from my iphone or ipad several times a day and i enjoy itcomprehensive aesthetically pleasing amp wonderful app  i like how this app lets me experience my realtime financial picture customize my alert preferences manage my accounts from anywhere this is as good as the desktop experience  so many fun features nothing compares to the unparalleled stellar service i receive as a chase private client amp business banking customer  i highly endorse chase enjoy their elite service and  chase jpmorgan credit cards bravo chase,1this app makes life a bit easier with the flexibility of being able to pay for things hassle free having a record also by paying for items this way also helps to keep track of payments and of things bought this is a huge help when needing to look something up which was paid for in the past the only down side is that occasional it will freeze up in the middle of doing something but never had a problem where it wouldnt come back once it was rebooted one other down side is that there is no way to search for a specific amount or location of purchase except to go to a desk top computer and do it that way when you cant get to a desk top computer its a little bit of a draw back other than that good app,1so you live  mikes west of san antonio you want to bank online you would think you could deposit a check these days to your bank account maybe you can i have had a few road blocks doing so its sad that the iphone app store is the only easily findable place you can provide feedback to you bank is there a place to provide feedback in the app i have gotten the message cannot connect to chase try again later after going through the process of updating my app looking up and choosing my account number amount and taking pictures front and back i have better things to do than fool around with operational issues cant chase check earlier in the process and tell me the app cant connect with chase i only have ninety days to deposit my check and chase always wants to charge me a fee because i took too long to pay them what are your expectations of your bank have some feedback chase,0i just switched to chase from citi bank and am slightly concerned because it doesnt show all of my transactions it only shows transactions per pay period on the main screen when you log in it would be much better if it would say right away what the total balance is pending balance and all transactions also this may seem small but when you make a payment it shows up in bold red which to me is associated with my account moving more in the red i think they should switch the color when you make a payment to blue or green and when you make a purchase to your credit card it should be red or another negative color theres more i dislike about the app but dont have time to write it out its just fine id expect greatness from such a large bank like chase i loved the citibank app so much it was perfect compared to this one,1not sure if anyone else with the app is having this problem ive been using the chase app for a few years now but lately every time i go to login i get a message saying too many logon attempts it looks like youre having trouble signing in please reset your password mind you i know my password and i only entered it in once so ill go ahead and reset my password and then i go to sign in and it will let me sign in that one time the next time i go to sign into my chase app i will get the too many login attempts message again prior to this happening i had no problems with my chase app it worked perfectly fine but i want to say for the past maybe five months this has been happening i cannot even tell you how many times i have change my password because of this happening if anyone knows why this is going on and has a solution please enlighten me,1dont pay any attention to the bad reviews people having problems with it crashing might need to try redownloading the app because i have never had it crash on me the only problem i have had is when you go to do a transfer and it is after hours it tries to change the date to the next day when it does it wont allow you to proceed so you have to back out and do the transfer again changing the date to the next day manually otherwise its an exceptional app being able to check your account and do transfers from anywhere is amazing also the feature to find a branch or an atm anywhere is great it even gives you directionsone thing that would be nice is if they displayed phone numbers for the branchesoverall app is great  stars,1i really only have one issue with this app but it bothers me enough to give it only  stars the way you have to view alerts is way too clunky and not intuitive at all if i miss the actual alert popping up on my screen i should just be able to enter the app see my alerts right on the home page and then the badge app icon should clear immediately i should not have to log in go to more alerts history clear the pop up that there are no alerts for my savings account since it is the first account on the pulldown list and then try and remember or figure out which other account the alert had been for and choose it from the pull down menu frankly i am very surprised and disappointed that this still has not been changed every update i have expected to see it improved and it is still the same chase please change this soon,1great app use it everyday ive seen some complaints about message center and problems getting to automatic pay my advise is if you take your time to learn the app and its new updated it would be much easier i also believe that all the upgrades are to make it easier for the customer to use another problem could be that the device youre using is very slow so the complains about not having your message load in a timely manner could be an issue with your device and not the app itself my suggestion is to set up notification on your device  your notification will come directly to your device rather than you going to your message center to retrieve your messages i absolutely love this app and i cannot  imagine banking without it,1i have bank accounts at bank of america several regional banks for my kids in college and chase is by far the best mobile banking app of the bunch only issue i have is that the alerts are weak you get a badge indicator but no idea which account is ties to once you go into the app you cant see what they are until you burrow seven layers deep into menus only to find its not worthy of your time to be a badge alert  you cant ack the alert to make the badge indicator disappear without going thru all this the secure alerts are usually headers with zero content when you look at them still the rest is excellent the chase pay works great check deposits are faster and not glitchy like boa the ability to drop into brokerage accounts and see how theyre performing quickly is nice touch  fix the alerts and id give this  stars,1i remember the days not too long ago where checking my account required logging on to a website making a phone call or god forbid actually going to the bank this app makes it so simple not only to keep tabs on your spending but also to quickly fix an overdrawn account by transferring money from savings before late charges incur i also love the quick pay feature big group of friends out to dinner and the waiter brings one check no problem i can instantly send or receive money from other friends who have chase most of them do to cover portions of the meal thats just one example but i usually find a reason to use this app daily love how simple it is and i hope i never have to be without it again,1been using this app for years since its original live date love it now not so great in prior versions  convenient to deposit checks now that theyve fixed most bugs amp upped the ridiculously low deposit limits remember to take pics of your deposit checks in reasonably good lighting though  i find app is usually reliable and saves a lot of time by allowing me to very quickly find payment history on bill pay amp in also doing the usual banking tasks like transfermonitorcommunicatebill pay i havent written a paper check in years i know thats not news to most folks by now but app has come so far from the days of paper amp pm storefront closings  chase seems to listen amp act on my gripes about this app in the past so thats important too,1i have generally been impressed with the features the developersdesigners have chosen to take a shot  but it doesnt appear there is any testing done by a group dedicated for such a purpose qa support is minimal  best amp the robophone system along with the rest of the company goes the extra mile to keep you from talking to a human  even then it seems like they are in an incredible hurry the single largest complaint i have is the apps ability to maintain the correct password acct combo since spring i have had to change my password every time i login thank goodness you can have the same password for mobile app amp browser clients i have reported this issue  times this yr with  least half of them written up in detail but to no apparent attention i communicated via email and phone in the attempt to resolve some nasty behavior but no more not even a reply this app has potential but only if you can rely on a regular basis i do pray the bean counters and tech vp will enable them to build a solid app,0thanks for finally adding fingerprint feature that was a huge issue i used to have now having it plus the overall ux experience im a big fan the more ability to do all things i need on the app and never go to my computer or call in the better like give notice im out of town freeze account if i think its lost chat a rep if something is wrong change my address change my pin open a savings account or other offers dont make me go into a branch for anything we live in st cen the brand should just be fore people who want to talk someone in person i should never be required to go in i went with discover for my savings account instead because everything is digital but chase has a great credit digital experience just need to extend the great digital experience to all your products,1loved this app before recent update dec  the only hiccup used to be if a signature drifted down over the routing number the app could not rectify the digits and you had to go to the bank otherwise it was a great  of all deposits worked and took less than  seconds new version  added  steps to deposit process with annoying pop up windows now they want you to write for electronic deposit only at chase on the back of the check i have never done this in s of deposits is this necessary the flow of deposit ui could be much better ie  after you take pictures if front of check automatically goto the back of check picture its intuitively the next step the way it works now you have to navigate  more screens to get there minimize screens maximize flow of ui this should be the driving goal of all software otherwise a solid product ime,1i have done a review of the chase app over a year ago and had a lot to gripe about i hated the fact that you had to accept quickpays i also hated the fact that you needed to login to conduct transactions after you used your finger print to get into your app both of these annoyances have been fixed with this update i absolutely love the way chase deducts the money for bill pays right on the spot it makes your balances so much easier to manage i love the freshness and the hightech feel of the app one area for improvement would be to allow a direct dialed phone call to a representative right from the app having already completed the authentication process also allow the app to show images of all transactions including deposits just like boa does other than those  the app is perfect,1ill start off by saying there are some good things about the app but it quickly goes downhill in a couple of major areas  amex lets me access my business card and spg card via one login chase forces you to separate them  ink vs southwest card for example highly annoyed by that separate it on your end if thats how you want to model your workflows but be thoughtful to your customers and let us add all cards to one login in the app  im suspicious that this may have had improvements made in the last update but the touch id constantly seems to get overruled by some sort of verification in the app and i have to enter my password which i have to get from my password file on my laptop due to it being a complex password again this is highly annoying chase has good products credit card offerings but i loathe using the app especially compared to citi and amexs apps those just work like you expect them to,0as yet to be band manager i keep track of everything selling merch transport costs payments for crew ectwhile still getting the actual band to write and play music doing all this plus a full time job leaves me with little time to worry about if my account will pay for everything it used to be calls about declined cards but no more thanks to this chase app and the notifications im able to tell if an account is too low and that lets me know when i need to either make a transfer or deposit now when i go to buy the yet to be tshirts for a gig or pay for the bands studio time i know exactly how much money i have and what ill need to make a transfer or deposit thanks to this app life made simple if you dont believe me well try the app  stars,1love love love  i have a lot of accounts between personal business and custodial for the kids if one of them says they need  for gas money i dont have to meet up with them in  seconds i can transfer it to their account can photo deposit checks right into an account i can transfer money to my charge card which i use like a checking account because of the reward points i use this app probably  to  times a day and no problems its easier than going on line with my laptop love it love it love it i think the kids love it more than i do because i can always bail them out of a money problem without having to wait for me to get there and if they go out of town i know i can always help them with just a text or phone call to let me know what they need,1i run a small business by using this app on my iphone i never have to go inside the bank i do everything form within this app in the past  or  years that i have been using this app i think i have been inside the bank maybe two times  by far the best feature of this app is the availability of make deposits of customers checks best of all as long as i make the deposit by  pm eastern time the funds are available the following morning all from the comfort of my phone i actually take a customers check and make the deposit with this app and then i hand the customer back the check this blows their minds the best app of its kind it really lets me run my business without having to hire people to run to the bank for me,1the chase mobile app is lacking in so many features that its hard to even give it the twostar rating i have two accounts one checking and one auto loan with them the most recent reason im frustrated with the app is because my interest percentage isnt listed anywhere on the statement thats just ridiculous also there is no ability to see monthly statements on my checking account how hard could that possibly be to do properly my capital one accounts all have the option of viewing my statements in the app theres also no option to email customer service or other departments via the app not by direct email through the app or through my email server really in todays day and age my only option through the app is to call the mobile deposit feature is fairly easy to use as is quickpay those are the only reasons for the additional star the app leaves a lot to be desired,0i have been banking with chase for about  years now and when i started using this app on my phone i have been in heaven the ease of use and convenience have kept me coming back  i love all of the features so much that i only use my phone for all of my banking needs  i can deposit checks add money to my daughters account check my credit card balance and so many more features  when touch id was added you are required to add your password if you want to do anything other than look at your accounts i am super happy to have touch id but i was hoping it would eliminate the need for a password other than that this app is amazing i would recommend itupdate password no longer needed just a quick finger scan and i am in ,1this is a great app if not for the deposit feature chase so ardently pushes in commercials  which would be wonderful    if it worked  you jump through all the hoops enter the information photograph the check front and back making sure all numbers are clearly visible but still the app will make you retake the pictures again and again and again and again  ive never been able to do it in less than four gorounds  another criticism is that the app will let you go through the whole shebang    and then tell you that it cant connect to chase sorry try again later  even though it has apparently connected to chase and gotten all your account information which is nicely displayed  in short  the app is great except for the deposit feature  for that one feature if i could give it negative stars i would,1i dont know whats going on with the app dont get me wrong this app is great at always notifying me right after i make a purchase amp its fast and easy to use but the money it shows i have available in my account to use is not accurate i notice i started seeing charges i made notify me right after i made them but the date changed on them as i reviewed my account later yes i understand it takes time to clear but the date would change to  days later after i made the purchase or payed a bill the app would take the money out my account after i make a purchase than put it back showing me a different balance than what my actual balance is causing me to be overdrawn more than quite a handful of times at the end of the day i would get notice of money i didnt have a deposits that are late can you please fix this bug make it show current balances,1never before have i used a financial app with so many problems as this one lord have mercy on your eternal soul if you forget your password and attempt to retrieve it this has happened to me a couple of times where i put all the necessary information in and it comes back with an apology message stating that the system is down for maintenance and to try again later thats something that could easily be communicated before you jump through hoops and over hurdles the way the app brings up the keyboard is equally annoying as it covers up areas that are required to be filled since you cant see them you cant fill them and since they arent filled you go through an endless game of try again that is until the system kicks you out for being idle asks you to start over only to go through all the steps and receive an error message that forces you to close the app and reopen it beware,0i got onto my accounts to see how everything was looking did some extra spending and wanted make sure all was good the money tracking thing kept coming up and when i hit the arrow like i usually would it said that i was leaving the chase site this is not something something i want another company doing for me ive had great service with chase bank and i wish to continue to do so im not sure how many others feel about this but i for one do not like it with all the hackers in the world nowadays i wouldnt trust this service any more than the strength in my little finger just saying i like your business the way it is i can trust that my bank accounts are in good hands with you and only you no money trackers are needed thank you for taking the time to read this sincerely miss teresa e fox,1this app is phenomenal i could not be happier with chase and this app super easy to use and manage settings if you spend the time to set this up its very user friendly and customizable literally in the process of closing my pnc account because chase is friendlier and has such a good app now for the pnc bashing time pnc has multiple apps at one point i had both of them and their servers were constantly down if i had forgotten my password i couldnt reset it from the app i had to call in bottom line it was down all the time and is indicative of how theyll treat you on the phone when you call i use this app every day to stay on top of my finances and it makes me check my bank account balance even when i dont want to lol,1love this appbanking never been easier low rating is from if you look most reviews are flood reviews from when they couldnt log in or there was a problem and its because they dont have an annoying rate this app that pops up during use of app people usually feel the need to rate low than have urge to go out of their way to rate high i love this app and can always check my balance anytime prevented a gazillion overdrafts cuz im poor and usually hovering around  makes paying credit cards for credit score easier than ever when mixed with the credit card apps and its been the best thing in banking since text balance checking chase always does it first and the other banks always copy chase and chase even lets them legitimately great app,1this little app has been a lifesaver numerous times for me i love how easy it is to log on to check my balance or if a purchase went through for the right amount its pretty instant for most the part when the atm i go to is down and cant deposit checks to that atm its nice to know that i can deposit via the chase app wish it would clear faster than an atm i really like the new outlay of the app i liked the old one too but this new one is pleasant on the eyes as long as chase stays with blue accented by white ill be happy with the outlay of the app few times i couldnt access my information but that wasnt because of the app and chase forewarned that it would be down those times anyways so it wasnt as if i wasnt prepared for those times overall a great app,1i have had this app since high school although for that i needed a parent with my account it makes it really easy for my parent to send me money while im away at school the transfer from his account to mine is effortless this is also a great and trusting alternate to venmo if using the chase quick pay and believe me there are plenty of times when ive needed to pay someone for something in college another great feature is the quick deposit for checks with a lot of friends from out of town they have local banks so without them having to use a random atm and get charged a fee they can easily write a check and its easy for me to on the spot deposit that i love this app and recommend it and chase banking to all of my friends,1the chase app is close to perfect you can manage your accounts with ease accuracy and with a level of detail unmatched by other banking apps you can see account balances pending amp posted charges detailed transactions including check images and more in real time and simply with your fingerprint the immediate push amp email notifications work great all of your accounts are bridged together for accounting continuity and you can see your reward balancessuggestion better integration with the reward program system would be great currently it seems that you have to leave the chase app to explore select amp receive rewards ill bet the chase app designers are already working to resolve thisbut again this chase app is excellent,1this app definitely helps maintain your finances if you bank with chase i personally have no trouble with chase at the moment because i only have a checking which i use so that i can have a debit card however when i try to to check my security messages it tells me that i have a message in my inbox but whenever i go to see what it is theres nothing there if there is a message id like to see it especially if there is a breach of security on my account my app is up to date on my side so they just need to update this app so this bug can be resolved the only real problem i have with this app so far other than that it works just fine i still only rate it  stars because a notoriously big bank like chase shouldnt allow this to go on for as long as i have been experiencing this issue plus i dont think theres anyone to call about these kind of issues please fix this so my mind can finally be at ease,0sure check deposit is always out of service can not add payee or edit current info folks never get chase auto finance they are so stupid crooks and do not know what they are doing everytime i call for something like asking for tax form titleif you move to diff state and even loan request after lease they say will open a request and get in touch with you after a  business days but they never do i have called again and again for the same reasons and they transfer me from dept to dept with no help at the end i gave up i had sold the carsudaru to a dealer i waited seven month after my lease was expired to get the loan but it was ever processed i had to drive the car for a year on out of state plates because they never transfer the paper world and paid taxes on the lease after i sold the car and they got the payoff check from the dealer they called me like a million times asking for the title which they should have because they own the car when its lease,0this app is a breeze easy to swipe and review balance without logging on or after logging on all sales and pending sales transactions that were just posted but not completely processed are displayed to ensure your card has not been compromised the pay now feature is very easy to use and allows for multiple banking accounts to be loaded during the initial setup then when you want to pay your bill it is a simple three step program amount from which bank account and choice of date to pay and its done i like to carry a zero balance so i pay my card a few times a month the system allows all pending transactions to be paid as if were a processed sale item user friendly,1it does what i need i can monitor my accounts transfer money look up account numbers when needed i can view previous statements account activities etc i wish and this is not the banks fault but im sure they could help with this when your viewing your transaction history some charges are shown with the most cryptic name and you have to go back to where you were to figure out what establishment is charging you  this is especially true of automatic deduction charges  it should be a thing that those line items explicitly show who is charging you its also hard to use the find a branch feature however maybe theyve fixed that already but i just dont bother with it now i just type banks into maps and see what i get usually better results,1have used several banks and credit unions before but chase is by far the best not sure what other people mean by not being able to lay whatever amount on their credit card i have a chase credit card and i am able to pay what ever amount i want at whatever time i want the app is very easy to use and provides way more information and way quicker than many other banking apps i have used for example i can quickly and easily pull up a check image right from the mobile app several other banks i have used this is not the case i can pull up the posted transaction but not the actual check image from the mobile app chase has been the absolute best bank i have ever used for mobile and technology banking,1the chase app makes banking anywhere easy transferring money from one account to another is simple as well as having the ability to deposit checks and transfer money from a different bank to your account  and vise versa  you can manage and change your personal alerts at anytime i have been using this app for over a year and never had any problems the few improvements that have been made only make the app even easier to use unlike some banking apps the chase app is not complicated and quite secure it enable me to always know the balances in my checking account credit cards and savings account i love the app thanks chase bank,1as you can see below i loved this app however now they have changed the format in which credit transactions are viewed statements i dont want a statement i want to review the transactions the same way i do for my checking account its more difficult to review specific transactions in a statement and id like the ability to tap on a transaction for more details in the event the brief description isnt sufficient this latest update seems to have taken the app a few steps backward i just hope someone there pays attention to these reviews my previous reviewive used this for several years now to balance my checkbook and manage finances i cant remember the last time there was a glitch and its become more and more reliable if i could change one thing it would only be the ability to see transaction details like you can on the ipad app,1i have utilized the chase app for as long as its been out i have enjoyed the solid reliability and simple functions that the well built app has provided with that said i believe its a time to upgrade the services both online and on the app infuse financial and spending review tools into your app and the online experience hell charge me a few bucks for it if it works well but i reach out to apps like mint and albert to assist me in viewing and understanding my spending i would love to see this incorporated into something offered by chase budgeting tools would be great as well keeping mind many customers budget by the paychecks received in a month and not just a monthly budget which i feel is a pitfall of the current budgeting apps out there now feel free to reach out to me directly if you would like further input regards  longstanding chase customer,1and everyday i wish i could give a chocolate cake and hugs to each person that developed the wonderful slide feature  thank you so much   with all of the identity theft now i can know exactly what my balance is wherever i am without having to enter my password and without making a huge announcement to everyone around me saying hey  everyone  im looking at my bank nowwoooo hoooo  plus all of the other great featuresjust another great reason i love my bank  i dont know if any other bank does this slidy thing or not ive been with chasejp morgan way longer than that  but if i were looking for a new bank now that would be a deal breaker for methank you so muchupdate june  still loving the app  thank you for all the great updates,1i too disagree with some of the negative comments about the chase app it functions better than any other bank i deal with im able to see my transactions instantly deposit checks using mobile deposit transfer money to savings amp payroll pay vendors amp family members through the online bill pay or quick pay options as well as wire money to my vendors my only negative is not being able to wire international payments through the appbut thats not a deal breaker for me i do like that my other bank lets me add notes to every transaction so i can easily keep track of things i wish chase would add this feature but again its not a deal breaker i would definitely recommend chase to my friends,1wamu customers arent screwed you just need to sign up for chase online banking ive had a chase account for quite some time and opened a wamu account a couple of years ago because it was closer both accounts show up the only thing i cant do with this app is issue a special overnight check i also signed up for sms text messaging with both banks requesting balances now shows the balance for both accounts much of the setup can be done on a computer online though you may have to visit a branch to start the process once you do that youre ready to do most of your banking through the app im more interested in functionality than cosmetics at the moment this app is fine and deserving of the star rating im giving it here,1every time i open the chase bank app to look at my dwindling funds i am not only reminded that my unemployment is starting to slowly starve me but how incredibly easy it is to view those negative funds with touch id loginevery time i regrettably open the chase bank app to transfer money from my savings account to my checking account i am amazed at how simple and hassle free it is to watch my hard earned money disappear in the name of my addiction to eating lest i experience the addictions withdrawal symptoms like hunger or dyingmobile check deposit is cool too when i do get checks it lets me continue to pay for an iphone that for some reason i decide to own instead of a high school diploma and a job with steady pay,1this is the worst mobile credit card app ive encountered the navigation is clumsy at bestfor example you can see the minimum payment due and the due date by swiping the screen to the preview screen but if you merely logon that information is completely unavailable to you in order to gain access to it once logged on you actually have to log off so that you can see the logon screen and swipe it for the preview againalmost any detail data requires you to enter your password again if you actually use secure passwords and rely upon the thumbprint identification to log onto your mobile app youre youre somewhat stuck for example if you use strong passwords which are almost impossible to remember and rely upon password programs or strong encryption to keep them safe youre stuck with this app having logged on with your phone print if you wish to see a statement or if you wish to make a payment the app will ask for your password and for these functions it wont except your thumbprint its not more secure its actually less secure because it requires you to either use simple easy to memorize passwords or to keep password list handybecause of this interruption of entering passwords multiple times in the middle of using it the flow with this app is horrible its slow its useless quite frankly its easier simply to simply go to your web browser and log onto the main site,0i feel secure which is the most important but if chase adds a few useful functionstools to help me manage my accounts i would use it more often adding a simple check box or something to mark each transaction off just so i know which payments i have approved because i keep a copy of a receipts and double check at the end of the month but what if i dont have a receipt of something how will i know which one i am missing what if its a fraud charge  also another useful function would be to create customized categories to file each transaction into  so when tax season comes life would be soo much easier especially for a small business ownerlastly the function of taking a photo of a check to deposit is great but how about that option for each transaction after marking off the transaction and filing it into your customized category then you have an option of storing a photo of a the receipt as proof of purchase especially for big purchases just incase a return needs to be made or to file a claim for whatever reason there is proof stored within my chase account chase i really hope you consider if not all at least a few of my suggestions i enjoy being a chase member the employees are always helpful in person i just wish the app can be,1there are many times when the bank makes the app unusable im guessing its for updates or something but they never post a notice as to why you cannot get in just says its unavailable the lack of consistent availability makes it very frustrating when you can get in sometimes it has problems i frequently get the error message that says i have previously deposited this check i have several repeat customers monthly and it isnt a duplicate check but it cant figure that out next when it does accept the check i frequently get the error message that there is a problem with the check there isnt as someone else stated you just have to retry it maybe  times to get it to accept it for a banking institution this size this app is way too buggie needs a lot of attention from the developer,1subject line sums it up chase recently updated both their mobile app and their desktop websites giving them similar interfaces they removed all the extraneous stuff and left only the important pertinent items the design is clean and easytouse yet everything you want and need to use is easy to find its crazy to say that chases selfservice features are one of the reasons i have been a loyal customer of theirs for over  years but its true other banks should take note give your customers an app thats enjoyable to use and you might keep them around longer just because of that chases developers did and are doing an excellent job i hope they keep it up,1ive never had an issue with this app it shows my balances all the time and yes sometimes the charge doesnt show up for example i ordered a new apple watch yesterday and i paid online but the charge hasnt gone through but thats not chases problem apple hasnt charged it yet so maybe there are companies that sell the item and at the end of the business day all the transactions go through its a good strategy to save them money charge per transaction i dont know there always an answer as to why things happen get informed  all you ppl complaining go back and ask to the seller all in all its a great app very useful and may having to pull up to the atm all the time to check balances or call and input so many numbers ,1it is not something really spectacular it is just a regular bank app and other banks have same things or even better one of my problem with the ios app is the alerts system when i go to my account to see the alerts it doesnt tell you that is for my checking account or my credit account or something elsemost of the alert or messages that has not been read yet are bold in most of the other alerting systems but in here it is not even when you find the alert most of the time there is no details regarding that alert like who took the money from your account or how much was the transaction  they just say the transaction was over your alert settings also recently i get some annoying adds on my app which are not relevant to my account but over all it is a convenient application thank,1i used to like the chase mobile app but theyve changed it to where it wont work on your phone with cellular data what good is a mobile app if it doesnt work when youre mobile i used to pay my credit card on the way to work or anywhere away from home im considering retiring my chase credit card until they fix it ill exclusively use my american express which works anywhere with my home wifi or away with cellular data and if it doesnt get fixed soon im going to withdraw my funds from chase bank and bank elsewhere im most unhappy well they fixed it so i guess i love it again im mad at american express now because they sponsor shakespeare in the park so i just use my chase credit card exclusively oh well,1i dont know if its just me but whenever i use any app on my iphone or ipad it works perfectly for me every app every time since maybe its because i follow these simple steps every time  close all apps running in the background i actually do this many times throughout the day power off my phone and wait at least  seconds to  minute then power it back on  download the app that i want  place the app where i want it     i make sure my whole phone is organized by same type of apps on same pages and same categories its very easy if you do it right away now that the app is where i want ittime to power off the phone again and wait  seconds to  minute and power it back on  now i may open and use the appespecially when using a banking app i want this to be the only app in use at that momenti follow steps    and  when im done using the banking app then i follow steps   and  again i also do this when just updating apps of course i always make sure my devices and apps are always updated thanks and hopefully this helps everyone thats ever had any issue with an apphappy apping,1if youre banking within the us this is a great app my issue is that it wont allow you to initiate wire transfers to foreign bank accounts which is exactly what i need since i live abroad also the mobile website doesnt provide you with the option to see the desktop version chase makes you log into a personal computer great for safety i suppose but super obnoxious for me anecdotal story the reason i say i suppose is that banking in europe is uber safe theres really no such thing as identify theft because each transfer requires a unique pin number and each card has a chip in it you can transfer amounts to friends within hours and across borders easily and within  hours its a different experience that makes you realize how primitive our banking system is,1generally i think this app does adequate in the normal features such as managing your accounts where am sometimes left with wanting improvements is in the alerts feature when this feature is called the active alerts should be presented on the next screen or something like it the annoyance is that you will have to navigate through the alerts feature to check on your alerts if you have active alerts the app is not immediately going to tell you which alerts they are or to which account youll have to work that one out yourself within the app the only help you can get is if you have the alerts pushed to your mail or text systems then you can make the connection so yes i like the app though i wish the alerts feature was more user friendly,1works great for everything from deposits to transfers and bill payments i use it almost everyday and now with the fingerprint sensor i dont have to type my password just swipe my finger the only negatives that i have are  the app could really benefit from a built in calculator  every sunday sometimes the whole weekend there are limited capabilities they must do server maintenance or something and it almost always seems as if i have to use those restricted functions on saturday or sunday but even with limited functionality you can still do the basics  the system for alerts is a little bit non user friendly you can set up to get emailed or texted alerts for all different activities in your account and thats great but if you do or more so if you dont you have to navigate through the inner parts of the app to find receive or set up preferences receiving alerts in the message center is mostly useless as they are often redundant or something you already know because you did it so a little rework of the alert center could help if you bank with chase then you should have this app youll almost never have to go to the bank again,1this app is amazing the stuff you could do on it are insane sendreceive money in seconds check your statements setup alerts view your recent offers and many many many more things which i dont have that kind of time to mention now it does have an issue with the touch id it keeps resetting every now and then if you log in too frequently maybe the app thinks its not you and every once in a while you need to type in your actual password to get in and enable it again ever think about thatnow if its asking you to reset your password that has happened to me once when i typed the wrong password too many times i think the app is overall great and it doesnt need much improvements,1the chase app is extremely easy to use everything is very accessible and labeled easily to find what is needed tabs are very organized to say the least as a new user of this app i think it is easy to get the hang of it very quickly it really has everything that you would need in order to easily manage your banking whether its viewing accounts transferring money monitoring charges and so forth also the presentation of the chase app is nice yet simple which makes it less distracting i also like the fact that touch id is available for this app and simply uses whatever touch id fingerprint that is already set up on your iphone these are the main reasons that i chose to give this app a five star rating,1i use this app all the time and find it useful  but i ran into a nice little problem with it  i used the deposit feature and i got a letter from them saying im being charged  because of a bad check  i look at their picture and they have cut off the account number on the bottom of the check they seem to take the left  of the check and discard the rest  i took a picture of the entire check from left to right and no one at chase even bothers to look at what i sent when they find a problem  they just charge you a fee and put it all on you to call them to get the fee reversed and then make you send them the same exact picture you already sent  check double check and triple check when you do a deposit or just go do it the old way  ill definitely think twice before ever using the depsit feature again,1i enjoy the overall design of the app its simple and easy to use the major problem i have with it however which is driving me to just use the mobile website or my computer instead of the app is that i can no longer pay my bills instead when i go into a bill pay menu and type out how much money i want to pay the number pad never disappears ill click done and the menu will change but the number pad remains theres no way to get rid of it without closing the app entirely and i cant finalize my payment whatsoever this is the case with credit card and miscellaneous bill paymentsi dont know what else this affects one other minor design issue i have with the app is that i am not able to search or sort through my bank account transactions i would love to be able to search through it on my phone the way i am able to search on my computer,0i love love this app everything is at my fingertips you can set alerts on your mobile for acct balances withdrawals deposits etc the best part is that i can transfer money instantly to accts when i am low or negative this is esp handy when im in line at the store amp realize i need to transfer money to my debit card in order to have enough to pay i pay my bills deposit checks and keep close track of my acct daily with apps like chase bank mobile who needs another bank chase mobile is one of the reasons ive stayed with chaseplus their excellent customer service this app allows you to do with your chase accts what lifelock says they do but better highly recommendno i have no other affiliations with chase just love the app,1this app is pretty good in most areas it sometimes will mess up when you take photos of checks to deposit and require a new photo of the front of the check however i once forgot to put in the change  portion of a check and got a message updating my deposit to include the extra cents so not too bad the main negative and resin for one star removed is that chase puts everything through their message center they email you then require you to log j to their crappy message center to read whatever they want to tell you i dont like it at all but the rest of the app is pretty good there is even a built in feature where the photo changes on the screen when your area changes so you get a different building a different chase building but its still kind of cool,1all my routine banking can be handled  through this app no matter where i am deposits bill payments set up auto pay deductions transfers between accounts check account balances and more    recently i paid my friend for a baseball ticket she purchased for me by using her name and email address  she also is an account holder at chase    i use the chase app everyday my only negative comment is about the finger print feature it isnt that convenient unless all you want to do is look at your accounts if you want to do any of the features listed in the first paragraph you need to use your password your fingerprint should be all you need to make payments deposits etc please simplify this feature,1i like the app for its ability to allow me secure access to view my accounts transfer balances pay my credit card and make deposits this all works fairly well the part i dont like is how inefficient accessing my alerts are i want alerts for certain things but i would like to see unacknowledged alerts on the front splash screen make it a banner at the top when i first log in also the details are often quite vague i would like to see a little more info when i open up one of these alerts and also i would like to be able to click on transactions and see some more detail things like when the transaction first went through where it was done what was bought if possible all the details the bank would be able to offer were i to call and ask about it keep up the good work,1i work in digital at a bank so i have several checking accounts at various banks big and small so i can study things like mobile banking apps and see how they compare across the market chase definitely sits at the top ui is sleek and matches their desktop online banking love the prelogin balance check and the ability to log in with touch id on my iphone money movement and all the basic stuff i need to do works well cant ask for much more and the personalized login screen is a nice touch alerts could use a little work the only ones ive seen that are better are amexs but its  good to see they are putting their multimillion dollar digital budget to good use they get what customers want these days and we benefit as a result,1i can do all of my banking from my phone this app is the best time saver for several years ive been able to avoid the line at the bank for any of my banking needs due to my physical limitations but having to continuously change my password because of too many failed attempts to login is thoroughly frustrating no one should be trying to access my account other than myself and i have fingerprint access to try and make my account harder to access by unauthorized individuals this happens at least once a week should i feel safer for the security measures in place or worried that hackers continually get close enough to enable the security measures i hope in the future this app improves enough to not have to be subjected to this frustration because this app is pretty great otherwise,1as some other reviews have mentioned there are many pros and cons of this apppros there are a lot of nice features of the app from transferring money between accounts to paying credit cards directly in the app even saving receipts for payments is easy nowcons touchid randomly gets disabled on an inconsistent basis if it was for security to make sure youre entering your password every once in awhile that should be stated not just that its not prompted if this is a factor there should be a balances only screen option for security i have noticed the most recent version has a finger print icon in the password field to force trigger the touchid sometimes odd that its needed some other issues is the commonly stated in reviews na balances issue that happens especially unusual since it can cycle through accounts that have this happen one login its checking close and reopen next time its savings etc then the transfer option may not work also would be nice if you can set up a repeating schedule of transfers like you can through the desktop on the webalso the constant requests to review the app is annoying even when i had reviewed it or said i wasnt interested seems to return every update which is pretty frequent,1i was looking forward to using this app for my business but it turned out to be a major fail the quick pay worked out fine on my part when i had sent a  test payment to my boyfriend unfortunately it took us over an hour to sign up enter information and emails back and forth to be able to receive the  we finally gave up it was not worth the time and energy i cannot imagine my clients wanting to go through so much hassle to send or receive money second i tried to deposit checks from my clients via quick deposit the first check worked out fine after that every picture i took was returned saying that it was not clear enough or that the account number on the check was not valid even though the number on the check matched the one on the picture it told me to deposit the checks at the branch so out of  checks only one went through needless to say i will get rid of the app and do my deposits at a branch,0i have many banking apps on my phone and chase consistently improves their app before the others the issues i had with the app in the past have been addressedoverall this is a good app even though i dont care for the most recent changes it seems to me that chase is more concerned on having the app look pretty instead of making it actually better im still waiting for an update that will make the fingerprint recognition more reliable and consistent several updates have come out since my last review overall i like the app and it does what i need it to do the one thing that is keeping me from giving it  stars is having to put in my password after already using my fingerprint to log in i understand the pros and cons of having this option and if i am willing to use this option then i shouldnt have to use a password to access certain parts of my account  stars if you arent familiar went the past versions then this app is great overall it is still better than the other banks but i dont particularly care for the lay out,1i have multiple accounts with chase and find the app convenient and easy to use its really great compared to other banks apps that i use the only reason this isnt  stars is the lack of touch id to login capital one uses touch id and i love it i dont want to use the token system offered by chase app i want real touch id using apples security features as i trust them add touch id and its  starsupdate i found the place to turn on touchid in the app unlike other apps that announce adding touchid and have it right in the main app window this app has it inside the settings menu in the app i think they should move this into the main window for first time setup at the least so you cant miss it i did add the th star as a result though,1i had this problem with chase pay credit card option when i try to enter other amount in select payment amount screen the number pad appears after i enter the amount and hit done on number pad the number pad gets stuck and does not go away because of this i cannot continue further in paying the credit card i figured out a work around for this issue after entering the amount using number pad dont click on done on number pad instead click on the same other amount field but just to the left side of where youre entering the amount this seems to clear the number pad and allows you to go to next screen where you can authorize chase to complete the transaction hope this helps chase programmers please note this work around,1we keep getting updates to this app but they dont add major usability features that would make this app more usable and less annoying the two features i find i need most and that cause the most annoyance because they dont exist are login and alerts when i login i have to type in my long complicated chase online password every time i always mess it up at least once please implement touch id for login here this is the perfect candidate for this technology when my app give me a push alert i have to go through the above mentioned painful login process and then i have to dig through menus to find the alert when i have an alert it should be the first thing i see when i log in to the app i shouldnt have to go to my accounts then switch to the account with the alert then tap alerts    you get the picture,1i thought the check deposit feature would save me from having to switch banks when i moved but i have had a roller coaster of problems with it sometimes the app takes the photo and immediately tells you its too blurry but at other times you get a message that your deposit was accepted only to get an email later telling you they cant accept the deposit and then not letting you try all over again because the app is programmed to think the check was already deposited and thats not mentioning the misleading acceptance of deposit message i got only to be fined later for a check they couldnt accept today the adventure continued it was absolutely impossible for me to hold the camera steady enough for the picture to actually take presumably as a software update result since it erred on the side of taking blurry photos previously not impressed,0the app itself is great works so you dont have to use the atm machines which is a more safe and faster alternative i still deposit checks thru the machines as i like the check image printed on the receipt for better record keeping but that i do only once a month and in a store setting only chase  as with all other banks and vendors needs to stop putting a limit on time for payments received ridiculous that a payment online can only be placed at certain times as though there are humans working and waiting to press the keys to accept but as great as this app is if and when the credit union creates an app to do just half the things the chase app does im out of here because it will save me a ton of money from all the fees associated with credit cards services banking and account restrictions,1i agree with minoop its good but for a few small issues it isnt necessary to send alerts that theres a message in your secure mailbox about your new privacy rules you can send me an email and if it gets hacked i guess the secrets outi like fingerprint access but if its so secure that i can use it to pay for things with my credit card using only my smartphone why not give fuller access to my accounts eg to pay my electric or cable bills i can see why you wouldnt allow transfers but bills under say  should be okay if i elect to allow that other than that im real happy its a useful tool it works fast and its very secure in fact its quicker and more convenient than the full site on my laptop i much prefer using this app,1i find this app to be very good it has all the functions and features i need to do my banking i especially like the alerts i get notified within seconds of when a transaction against my account occurs i like using the touch id instead of having to type in my password its so much faster the ability to deposit checks with my phone is great too i find it to be very useful the only complaint is that if you sign out and then decide to you want to go back in the touch id isnt available to get it back you have to close the app and then reopen it another bank app i use has a button to bring up touch id im on iphone ios v and do not have any of the problems those worst app people are complaining about,1making the upgrades mandatory is simply annoying this latest version has a problem with the check images its rejecting multiple attempts to accept photographs of the front and back of the check these are type written checks from public agencies not personal hand written checks ive talked to other people who are having the same problem from their iphone  and may   just download the mandatory update it messed up the camera function again  for some reason it does not allow for the focus feature and so once again it wont accept photographs of checks its also now glitchy when logging on and dropping the app at various times why cant they just leave well enough alone and stop with the mandatory updates that just create new problems  who do they think they are  apple,1update  they need to fix the alerts it says you have some and you go and look but have to search through your account to see which had alerts basically add an alerts screen that shows me all the new alerts pleaseupdate  i still really like this app the one area of improvement is the alerts when you have alerts a number is shown on the menu however when you tap on the alerts and then view alerts you have no idea where the new alerts are and which account they were associated with give us an option to see new alerts or which accounts have alerts i have used several banking apps and this is by far the best one easy to do all your banking transfer funds pay bills deposit checks dont change a thing,1awesome app love being able to deposit checks when youre not being punished for bouncing one being able to check your balance without opening the entire app and the quick pay is amazing being able to set notifications based on whats best for you rather than getting several unwanted notifications is also a great feature i actually cant think of a negative thing to say except it would be nice to be able to deposit to my checking account again havent been allowed to since i bounced a few checks and its a drag to have to put them in our savings account and transfer the  to checking not sure how long theyll hold this against me over all a great app very happy customer ,1this is by far the very best banking app out of any banking app i have used i love this app and the features it provides the ability to transfer money between checking and savings accounts at any time and the money transfer being immediately ready for use is extremely helpful or if you forget to deposit a check in the bank you can just take a picture of the front and back of the check and electronically deposit it thats also helpful and relieves people who have a busy life and a forgetful memoryalso the app does exactly what you tell it to do by sending you alerts of purchases or balances at the designated time its just a very great app i wouldnt even consider anything less than  stars,1i honestly do not care for chase bank and the only reason i ended up at chase was because they gobbled up the small bank i initially banked with  i planned to change to another smaller bank but their online banking was always miles ahead of the competition well as the gap closed in the online banking arena my reasons for staying also diminished  however this mobile app of theirs is simply stellar  i can manage my personal accounts my business account my cc account all with ease  the quick pay is fantastic and the mobile deposit simply invaluable  i can honestly state the only reason i keep my business and personal accounts at chase at this time is their mobile app  good job,1i love how i can deposit my work checks into my account through the app instead of having to go to the bank i also like how i can easily see how much is in my bank by swiping left when i go into the app and not having to sign in but what made me thought of having an easier way to check how much money is in my bank is by having the app accessible through my apple watch because i always wear my watch so i could easily access the app through it maybe enable some features of viewing past expenses through the watch and maybe adding a glance to how much money is in the account that would be so awesome if the developers are reading through do this idea it would make it so awesome,1this is one app that is very worth having which has become near indispensable to me i have had and used other bank apps before i banked at chase and frankly those apps were not as good as this onebeing able to instantly transfer funds while on the go in response to my preset alerts has been invaluable and saved me a lot in nsf fees also being able to deposit checks without having to get to a branch or atm has been proven very convenient and helped me from being overdrawn at times not to mention saving me time and gasmy only complaints are  that alerts for my personal account do not arrive until the day after the account becomes overdrawn  unlike my business account which alerts me immediately  my only other complaint is that alerts are not synced so that if i read them on my laptop my phone still shows active alerts waiting to be read until i open the app and go to the alerts folder my favorite update to the app was when they recently enabled us to be able to check account balances without having to log in this is a great tool overall i rate the app as being almost perfect love it,1full disclosure i am a banker i do not work for jp morgan chase so i hope you take take that i work for one of its competitors makes this review a little more sincere the chase mobile banking app is the most helpful of its kind the quick and easy log in options is most helpful then we dive into the features it offers most likable is the pay a bill feature the quick and secure way of paying a bill without having to find a partner biller is amazing one thing that can be frustrating is the once a month sunday that the app is off line this is due to security updates and checkups i feel very comfortable to sacrifice a day of convenience to ensure my accounts are always being checked for security,1i live  miles from my closest chase bank so i was thrilled to get this ap  however the deposits are delayed and do not show up in my account immediately like when i make a deposit at the bank or their atm  you dont get a receipt with the check picture like i can get at the atm and the picture must be perfect before the chase app will accept it for deposit  even when the check picture is perfect it has difficulty recognizing the check amount if the handwriting is not perfectly formed numbers so you end up retaking the picture and trying to resubmit several times before it will accept the check  as of now if i need to get a deposit in i think ill still make the drive unless it will be several days before my next trip to town  hey chaseyou still need to make some improvements to this ap,1i couldnt believe my luck when i joined this bank  i kept a relatively low deposit and used it to pay for all of my online activities  then last week i got this nasty surprise  unless you keep  per month in the account or you direct deposit  minimum per month you will be deducted  per month   since this was my internet account i didnt put money in  i took the no interest route as punishment for not using it every month  but to charge  per month for long term holders is just crazy  now i will have to go elsewhere  pity because i was considering a permanent move to chase due to the internet access and due to this app   now i will have to do a search for somewhere else   so its a  for the app but a  for adding fees averages out to a ,1i actually look forward to logging in and checking my account now err though sometimes i dont like the balances i see in there after bills are paid  chase mobile app makes it easy to transfer and view your accounts when you are on the go saves a trip to the bank with check scan deposit and allows you to always know the status of your funds and account information with customized push notificationsupdatesi really like the balance swipe view for checking accounts if i need to check my bank account balances in a time bind just swipe to the rightsmartphone app and there i can see it this is a sophisticated app with a lot to offer for chase account holders,1even to as yo guy this app makes life easy being able to deposit checks by taking pictures of the front and back of them make my busy college life incredibly less stressful and to add to this already great feature the checks you deposit this way normally only take one night to go through their pending process another great feature is being able to see your accounts balance within the minute anytime and i really do mean anytime you have your smart phone in you great app that has not only made balancing a checking account easier but has also made balancing a busy life packed with work and stress easier ill easily and happily give this app five out of five stars any day,1i had several different accounts w different banks between my personal banking accounts my business banking accounts my wifes accounts and my childrens accounts but after  years of getting a feel for each bank bbampt b of a fifth third and huntington i switched all of the accounts to chase they make all of my needs and wants extremely convenient and they are constantly improving their service i would strongly encourage anyone opening a new account to go with chase their customer service is amazing and they constantly adapt to our everchanging technological world through their app and other services to make your banking experience easy and enjoyable trust me save yourself the headache go with chase,1im enjoying it so much at least your getting a little more for your money and it is getting better  im so much more happier then i was in the past at least somebodys listening thank u all at chase for all that u do o yeah u know im going to give u two more stars because this girl on the phone last month really helped me a lot she got me my money back after i talk to the company and they told me they didnt want to give me my money back and gave me the runaround and this angel at  my bank gave me my money back and my bank is chase every one at chase i love you all  god bless  you all amp keep up the grate work ok now im  ing your  one star because as im useing  the mobil app trying to find some thing when i just frist started and it would kick me out and i dont like that so can you fix that and ill give u  stars i actually think that would be worth  stars,1outstanding this is a very useful application i use it often to move money between accounts keeping a small sum in a working account and adding funds as needed that plan limits my hacking vulnerability to the small amount on deposit in the working account but ready access to other accounts is needed to make it work the app has been flawless for me with more than a year of experience so long as i have phone service it has been very reliable i can make funding choices while standing on line and rely upon the action when i get to the register the ability to have customizable buttons for frequently accessed functions like funds transfer would make it really outstanding,1since downloading the first version my first version of the chase app i have loved using it its convenient and saves me much time when i am away from my laptop to make transfers from my acct to my kids accts i no longer have to give them my debit card or have them come all the way home to get money before running those necessary last min errands i am able to pay bills from my phone as well as send money to family or friends when needed i must say i have not ventured out as far as using the deposit checks yet im a little nervous about doing that but i have used the quick pay and love it  overall i am very happy with this app thank you chase for making my banking a little more convenient ,1i really do love this app however my one quarrel with it is the search option or lack there of really i would like to be able to just search for a transaction by either the amount or name instead of having to scroll down and look this would take it to  stars for me i dont seem to have a problem with the checks i deposit through the app or any pending transactions i know that anything pending will clear depending on the amount available for that day even if the transaction is pending for days is it confusingyes but every bank works like this but the fact that i cannot search for a check number or some a transaction amount kills it for me i use other bank apps as this is not the only bank i have and those apps dont seem to have a problem with that it needs to be addressed,1i got the mobile app to deposit business checks into a business account  installation warned of addition charge to put money in an institution that makes money off my money crazy  then i said okay  i still need to make the deposit  i accepted the potential fees  then i need to accept the terms and conditions that were so small i would have needed a microscope to read  it appeared to have about  sections of legalize  i didnt have my attorney with me so i mailed to myself and put caution to the wind  okay im set to make my deposit  started the transaction only to discover that the app would only accept deposits of less that   since the check was for   i was out of luck  ill probably even get the feethis happened after going to the chase atm  where it would allow me to made a deposit either  first time in forty years of banking experience where the bank didnt want my deposit  soon they probably wont have my account,0i have multiple corporate accounts as well as some personal ones mainly for my kids who are all adults now  the app is okay at best and has problems all the time  the bank is also more interested in collecting fees than they are in servicing their customers  i have been having problems with not receiving alerts i set and on a small balance account i kept having auto transactions post that would overdraw the account  system used to send me a text alert and i could transfer or deposit funds and it was no problem  but that has stopped working and then chase hits me with fee after fee and even when i tell them about the problems they say sorry but we cant waive   they waive fees for me all the time on my business accounts but i guess the little guys get screwed  so i am waiving my hand as i and all of my multi million dollar accounts leave and will go to a bank that values all of its customers    sad,0the app itself is fine my problem is more with the powers that be at chase who have decided in their infinite wisdom that people dont need to see a running balance against each entry in the same way that most other banks do the time it takes for items to show up is also wack you see your balanced you add on all the pending items shown and you payoff that amount thinking you have a zero balance  then two days later you find there were other items dated before the last pending charge that you paid off in advance have now suddenly appeared meaning you still have a balancei never experience the same with my bofa credit card shopping at the same storesso this is really an overall issue with chase banking it not just the iphone app,1i have had the chase app for years it has gone through a myriad of updates and changes with the latest one being a good one it still works off and on with some unimportant notifications but overall it keeps me informed of my purchases on my account as well as my daughters account that is joined with mine it allows me to monitor her spending activity and make sure her card is being used by her not someone else plus i can transfer funds into her account immediately if needed when i see she is running low it has a  daily account summery any activity that ive set alerts for in settings and allows me to view and print my statements from my phone i really love the app overall,1when you want to quickly check your accounts or pay off your credit card this app will give you touch id access for viewing and options that are only a touches away quickpay and remote deposit works well too these are some of the most wellimplemented parts all of your actions will generate notifications and secure mails of which you may prefer viewing from the website this is already a bit noisy and less helpful even on the website the app makes viewing these more timeconsuming and difficult sometimes the notification count will not update properly on the badge on the app icon and on the inapp menu these secure mail messages could be made more helpful if their titles were more clear about the contents,1i find this to be about the best bank app ive used finger print sign in quickly shows pending transactions and processed transactions with balance after each transaction easy bill pay setup and easy to use updates available balance as soon as you finalize bill pay transactions other bank apps dont can be a problem if you forget about a bill pay you requested that hasnt processed and available balance app shows is several hundreds higher than it really is  other apps limit use of special characters such as    in memo field for bill pay very inconvenient i really like this app and have switched to using chase for most of my online banking because of it,1i dont know what everyone else is complaining about this app has worked flawlessly for me for years the touch id was a great addition and im not experiencing the issues that others have mentioned a few months ago i was prompted to change my password so i called  chase to verify this request and i was told its a new security method and i will need to do this every  days i appreciate that chase is protecting me from fraud customer service is outstanding  i have no problem navigating through the features i think its very easy and user friendly best app for banking i go here at least ten times a day i love the swipe to see your balance without logging in awesome feature thanks chase,1i love the app with the fingerprint technology im able to sign in quickly all my chase accounts are viewable from the same place ie credit cards checking and savings accounts mobile deposits are easy to use quick pay is faster then normal methods and i can do it right from the app transferring money to other people who use chase is effortless no issues with my direct deposits being visible when they should be mobile alerts is a very nice feature that keeps me updated on my accounts status several features that you are able to use through the app makes it very convenient if you cant use or get to a computer statements are easy to read as well from the app,1i switched over to chase a few years ago mainly because of the features they offer over the internet  this app works well for the most part  the login is a bit cumbersome with the long password they need for the internet login  itd be nice if they started using something along the lines of what mint offers  my only grip would be the depth that one has to go to in order to clear alerts  its buried rather deep in the app with no way to modify the app in the way apples music app does and even when i get drilled down to the alerts section the page that has the alerts isnt the default page  so i have to start hunting around for which account the alert is coming from  and it never is the one that i need to be onif they could fix that one nagging issue id be happy  ,1downloaded app to transfer balance from another card  things went well until i wanted to make the first payment  chase app cant be used to make the first payment unless you previously have a bank account through them  i called their customer service which was also unable to allow me to make a payment through their app  for those who do not bank with chase this is just not a good appfyi im a person who doesnt have a desktop computer probably the only person who doesnt the appchase require desktop authenticationhowever i rate this so low because when i called chase to establish the account payment so i may use the app their customer service is unable to make this happen  their policy it personnel require desktop entry by the customerfyi the irs has the technology on their website to make payments without a desktop computer very dissatisfied with an app whose primary purpose would be to make payments,0before adding touch id you logged into the app once and could do everything within the app after adding touch id you have to log in to perform several functions whats the point of adding touch id if now you are forced to enter your password several times within a single session ive started back using the computer to do most banking these days please fix thisupdate june  highly disappointed with this app a few weeks ago i saw that the app is still user unfriendly again i cannot believe with touch id activated that you have to enter your password several times whereas with touch id deactivated you only have to enter your password once i only use this app for mobile deposits now we rarely use our checking account so im not in the app much sad that the bank that introduced the first banking mobile now has the worse banking mobile app i use,0loved the chase app when it first came out also loved the initial version of online banking but every time they update something it screws it up instead of making improvements they need to get actual customers to try out the updates before they launch them in order to see if they are user friendly because so far none of the supposed upgrades are helpful at allespecially the most recent  bill pay upgrade in the chase app i used to be able to navigate bill pay with my eyes closed well almost and now i cant figure anything out its maddening everything has changed also i cant search for transactions in my checking account anymore why is that like a search by vendor name should be simple why wouldnt that work seems simple enoughused to be able to do that not nowwhy,0i have been using this app for years and never had an issue  whatever update they put in place recently makes the image recognition worthless  i have just spent  minutes trying to take a clear photo of the front of the check  each photo is very blurry and i have to retake  images of the checks used to be fine when i used the app  i finally got a clear image of the front after  minutes of frustration and when i tried to take a photo of the back i got the same blurry mess  then the app crashed on me logged me out and i have to start over  i am very upset right now as i am vacationing in a state that does not have a chase bank available i would like to deposit my money and cant  my other banking mobile app from another bank has none of these issues  come on chase  you have so much money but cant make a decent app,0this app was basically perfect when it first came out no problems since past updates it has longer loading time crashes frequently opens slower when you deposit a check it takes usually  days for it to be available but i have waited a week and a half for a number of checks before when i use my debit card the dates i made a purchase on do not line up with the dates chase puts in my history which makes it difficult to understand your own balance sometimes i feel as though i loose money from this flimsy app when i first got this app i had none of these problems it would have been five stars and said it was spectacular not anymore though with my work and class schedule it makes it impossible to get to the bank when they are open so this app is all i have for banking convenient at times but frustrating all the time,0this app is great i give it  of  stars not because it has any issues but because there is always room for improvement mobile check deposit works flawlessly  of the time being able to view my checking savings and credit accounts all on one screen is super convenient i can even view my chase freedom information and pay it via the app being able to transfer money back and forth between all the accounts is great the chase banking app allows me to have a firm handle on my money at all times i would certainly recommend to all chase customersone odd thing about this app though there was a fingerprint scanner for about  week which is now gone i would love to see that come back as it would be very convenient,1i have banked with many banks and like with some other reviewers i prefer to use more local banks i have returned to chase and appreciate the bank as a whole especially due to their online banking layout and their app i am on iphone s ios  at the time of this rating my favorited thing about this app is that my balance deducts as soon as i confirm bill payment regardless of when the check is actually cut if you think way back to when you filled out your check register it is the same thing you deduct the money to see whats left some other banks app will show the actual balance which can be deceiving if you have bills to pay but they havent hit yet personally that infuriates me,1pretty well designed for human interface and is task oriented rather than advertising oriented as many of these type apps are pros  all chase backed credit cards can be accessed with the app the app supports fingerprint login making access easy amp fast your first screen shows all cards and their current balance in the first screen each card has a button to press to make a payment cons  you have to do a lot of finger tapping to get to the summary of each account credit limit balance when next payment due etc even though you accessed the app with your fingerprint you have to enter the password for the app to make a payment which doesnt make much sense and is annoying it would help if payment screen showed history of payments,1theres a lot of money to be made by prolonging the problem   software engineerso    i make a  payment to my credit card from my checking account and nothing changes for two days the balances remain unchanged for two days  hard to believe heres another one    i redeem my rewards points to the tune of about  and nothing changes except that my rewards points go to zero but no deposit in my account for two days and no pending status anywhere to be found i did get an email to confirm what i had done and i also made a phone call to customer service  to confirm the vague status of my transactions why cant they just say pending deposit pending anything sheesh  finally i walk into a branch and tell the nice young ladies you know my money seems to disappear for a couple of days to which they respond gleefully i know huh  chase are you there  ,0love this app amp the convenience of being able to quickly check my balance pay my bill amp find answers to the majority of my questions within seconds i also like the ease of paperless billing i have enough wasted paper without having to add to it this way i can look up amp quickly print any bill i may need without having to shuffle through a bunch of file folders thus saving trees space amp valuable time i dont review any app or product without st using it for awhile ive been using this app for over  months maybe longer amp it is very user friendly amp i love the simplicity of the design in my opinion anyone no matter their age or tech level can easily navigate through this app,1its a good app for everything that i do with some extra nice features that they recently put in everything i needed done with no issues havent had any problems with it yet it could probably be a little better but overall i liked him and i definitely would recommend itupdatei like the touch feature that you can use on the app that has been there for awhile but lately it has been turn it self off how and why i dont know but very annoying i like the touch feature so when i am in public i dont have to worry about use of my pass and perhaps someone seeing it and or i look like a dork trying to hold my phone so no one can see the pass in one manner or another,1ive used this app since the beginning its there when i need it i set my alerts to notify me when my debit charges are over   the store is still processing my info and chase shows the amount deducted  amp i gleefully announce alright the amount is correct and paid      the only problem i had recently was a delay in the receiving money category it wasnt listed for about a week thats the longest ive seen for chase to fix a problem i am happy to be able to pay amp deposit on the go     my only unhappiness now is the change in overdraft coverage   it seems chase wants more of my money and didnt like that i could transfer money to prevent these charges and embarrassing situations they keep changing their accounts and adding  charges,1love touch id so why does this app still prompt you for password after you log in to pay your bills or use quick pay doesnt do it for a deposit and most competing banks dont require the second verification after a fingerprint including citi discover and capital one seems pointless and redundant not to mention poor user experience chase alerts are also horrible you get a notice of a secure message and half the time you cant access them from the mobile app for bill pay it would be great to access payee history easier and for peets sake please build a search function for your prior transactions like the one that is available on the desktop  ecommerce site its annoying to scroll thru account history to find what youre looking for,1is there any way that you guys can stop interrupting our access to this application every time you make your updates this would be ok if your updates were not literally every other week im starting to think about other options for my app banking because this app is sorely getting on my last nerve the whole reason im using this app is so that i can have quick access to my account  not so that i would need to keep being rerouted to the apple store to update my app before i can quickly access it at that rate i might as well just find a nearby computer please figure this out because youre about to lose a customer im sure that you have already lost customers for this app because of this one thing i just want to leave by pointing out that your competitors eg capital one do not require us to keep updating before we can continue using the app,0this is a darn good app  i have used it since first offered  very convenient for checking recent charges on credit or debit cards to check for unauthorized transactions love deposit check by taking pictures only gripe and it is a minor one you cannot enter a recurring transfer but you can make one time transfers all the time anytime  every account including my mortgage and investment accounts are online it is the most seamless bank app available capitalone makes you go to one site for checking and savings and another site for credit cards this is a mature app all functions are present very slick i cannot think of any other app that i like more than the chase app,1first of all i want to say i have been chase customer since  and worked for chase for  years despite going to work for another one of the big   i am a private client customer at chase i like the mobile app and actually i have become dependent on it because the new website is the worst website of any of the financial institutions i deal with  i loved the old chase com  it was simple and straight forward i spent an hour trying to change a payee after calling customer service  i was told i had to delete it and re enter it you cant print transaction data cant find even the simplest things thank goodness they have the app  because the stupid website is so ridiculously over thought i have no choice but to use the app,1this app used to be  stars but its barely a  now its ridiculous that only one outside source can be authorized to enter your own account meaning a phone tablet or computer now you have to reenlist each apparatus if its different from the last time you entered the website its a real pain also its extremely  frustrating when transferring funds from one account to another it was much more simple in the past now you have to start tell the app its the wrong account then redo your entry if you have multiple accounts which i do the system somehow has a default account that it always chooses to transfer from which i rarely transfer from that particular account other than that the app is great and i recommend chase to family and friends please fix these issues,1the customer service gentleman at chase was appalled when i went to replace my lost debit card when he found out that i had no idea about the money in my account or how it was spent he said i needed to know everything and literally took my phone out of my hand and put the app on my phone now all i do is yell at my teens whose accounts are linked to mine because they spend way too much money on fast food and movies and appreciate my poor husband who just seems to spend money on bills we work our butts off and all we spend money on is necessities and these turds seems to go to starbucks chipotle and the movies all the time  my kids hate you but i thank you chase man and your handy dandy app,1come on folks as i see i am one of many loyal customers that you totally disregard by failing to fix your case app has me chasing one department after another as a developer chase did this app but why not fix it work for everyone not just a few as i read here who have no problems   as i was one of you hey its the economy stupid but now more importantly it is my money i want to access to i hope chase reads this as they will understand all my other bank apps sas yours did  well fix it is as urgent as was the cliff created by congress now the chase cliff has to be universaly repaired ps happy new year to my many chase employee friends okay guys i did it as you suggested your move chase make it work,1ive been banking with chase for about  years and ive had the app for about the same amount of time i absolutely love it it lets me see a summary of my accounts and payment activities i love the quick pay feature because it allows me to make a payment without having to go to the actual bank i can also see my bank statements the only issue i used to have but that they have fixed is the fact that i couldnt see the messages on my inbox on the app i think they have done a pretty good job at listening and responding to the feedback that other reviewers have given this app and i would definitely recommend downloading it it just makes banking so much easier,1i find this app very easy to use i get a text notification that my phone bill is due for example and in just a couple of minutes ive paid it the app is intuitive and quick i like it a lot there are two things that make me laugh because they are kind of silly the first is that when i sign in with my touch fingerprint and then want to pay a bill you make me give the password let yourselves in on a little secret  no one has my fingerprint so that is way more secure than my password  the second funky thing is alerts youve started sending me email alerts when i make a payment  but do you tell me what you want me to know nope  you make me get on the app and look at the message center thats a waste of my time i was told by one of your people that its more secure  well news flash  its really not that interesting or important to anyone else so how about just sending the information in an email and saving me a stepother than those two sillinesses i really like the app  and i stay with chase specifically because your app and your website are easy to use thx,1every single god forsaken time there is an update it doesnt matter if you have touch id or not it will tell you try logging in manually then set your preferences to use touch id if you prefer when i try logging in it says too many attempts one attempt the touch id one that isnt recognized anymore this has been going on for months it doesnt help that you have to go through hoops and provide the atomic structure of the toilet paper you used the night before because the antifraud flag system is obviously overly sensitive and beyond ridiculous at this point tired of this nonsense chase has been a thorn in my side for far too long ive had to reset so many passwords its becoming a massive headache and here i was hoping the th bug fixes update would fix this nonsense cannot wait until i move to a new place no chase in sight and no more excuses to use this crazy cartel of a bank,0mobile deposits being taken away constantly when you need them the most is extremely aggravating this constant flipping backandforth of being allowed to deposit and then not being allowed to deposit is the primary reason why i am currently looking for a new bank whether this particular advantage available to your customers is through chase or an outside company its infuriating when its removed suddenly the mobile deposits are the only reason i downloaded the app ive tried calling and talking to people on multiple occasions only to be told that theres nothing that they can do well just so you know theres something that i can do i can find a new bank maybe my new bank wont be so wishywashy with the things that are supposed to be helpful to their clients,1problem below fixed but now there is a new problem with the alerts section for some reason the default alert section had changed to my saving account now i have to go through  extra steps to actually see and remove the alerts for my checking account that is extremely annoying please fix otherwise great app after most recent update alert icons wont disappear after reviewing alerts this is the second time this has happened after an update the first time it was fixed fix it again please  everything else ok quick deposit is awesome and i use it weekly no problems transfers work and i can pay my car payment through the app  all my banking is done on my phone  genius just wish there werent so many bugs every time the app is updated annoying,1in all honesty i have very little to complain about this app really the only thing i want is to be able to fingerprint authenticate instead of typing my password but that is a minor quibble the app does everything that it says it does and ive not had a problem with iti do wish that it ran a little better on older devices as i really dont think that its doing anything that processor intensive its basically fetching text from the internet and not even a lot of text i mean infinity blade ran fine on my iphone  but this app takes just as long to launch and navigateone other minor quibble i do wish there was an option in the notifications to tell me how much was deposited instead of merely telling me that there was a deposit,1it does almost everything i need done i rarely go to the branch anymore you can deposit small checks just by taking a photo of it on the app up to k or maybe k now its great even for small businesses you can pay people with quickpaytransfer money instantaneously from any of my chase accounts which avoids overdraft fees it alerts me of anything i tell it to warn me about such as your balance is below x dollars so i can transfer money to cover it you can do wire transfers the best part is to be able to pay my credit cards anytime i need with one click choose an amount so i can manage balances closely so i have have great control of my credit score im happy with it,1i love this app through the years of having a chase account they have continuously upgraded the features for this app and their customer service as a whole i think many people dont know how to use this app for all that it is worth and so that can be frustrating for them but this has everything i need to quickly deposit a check look at my funds transfer money and know where my money is going ive never had a problem with this app i think if youre wanting to do a bunch of accounting and changes to your account just go into a local branch or get on their website from a computer this app is so easy to use and helpful for quick glances,1i find the app convenient and easy to use i havent run into any issues that i havent been able to figure out and resolve myself it works just like other types of its kind the only difference is that i feel that getting into this app is like getting into fort knox vs my other credit card apps are as easy as storming a teepee in an empty village so i definitely feel my information is extremely safe with this app nowadays safety is even more important than ever if i run into any issues that i find could use improvement or any problems i will certainly update my review for now im happy with it i can pay my bill in under a minute give or take and if anyone is interested they have all of their other banking offers,1so apple changes ios and forces app designers to create apps that will work with the new update in the process they decided that they didnt care about the rest of us who still use our old iphones that still work perfectly well as big of an institution as chase is one would think they would also offer the version for old ios users as well last i looked the app store still sells old versions of other applications so its either a new phone for + or a new bank with a better app these apps save the bank money by eliminating phone calls emails faxes deposits and the need to have an associate speakmeet with a customer bottom line is the bank gets fat on our cash and what we will save them in overhead the app electronic banking is supposed to return the favor as a convenience to us just wait next they will be charging us a monthly fee for not using the appoh wait they already do that,0the app was in need of an update and new design and now it looks great welcoming images and the sleek layout gives off a better impression making chase bank seem more reliable i dont think the increased size of font affects security if you want to use your app in public just be careful i use mine many times on the bus and am more discreet when i put in my password but while i am looking at my transactions i dont really care if anyone happens to glance and see that i had spent  dollars at starbucks earlier that day then again if you really are that bothered whether it be for the transactions or your account balances dont use your app where someone is able to clearly see your screen,1i use the chase app regularly and it consistently does exactly what i need when i need it  i can move money to my kids accounts pay bills check for charges to come through anytime  chase continues to invest in the app making it better as time has gone onshort story i saw a + plus charge go through on my credit card with an alert set up in the app  my wife nor i made the charge so i called chase  they verified it was a bogus charge and said they would send out s new card  but because i was using applepay the new card was instantly added to my apple wallet seconds after i hung up  simply amazing a thief ran my card and literally within  minutes i had a new card,1the app works great for managing your accounts until it needs an update which is quite often and you have to do it then and there or youre sol and cant access your account information the more frustrating part of this though is that its only after youve taken the time to enter your user name and password and hit login that it then tells you it needs to be updated its quite frustrating considering youre on a mobile device and the password isnt a simple  i would absolutely give it  stars if they would just tell me that an update is required when i first launch the app or simply allow access the first time and state that it needs to be updated the next time,1i love using my chase app because everything is literally at my fingertips the only reason i am not giving this app  stars is because of its inability to give me full access to my online settings for example update my login email etc i work  hours a week and rarely have time to login on a traditional computer or try to navigate the website on my browser on my phone so i love the ease this app gives me to schedule payments transfer money etc i just wish it would also allow me to change settings and update information too also i change my account from a student account to a regular account months agoand it still says chase collegeso it updating that kind of stuff would be nice ,1excellent interface with touchid sign in capabilities only downside with the touchid is that it overrides the account balance preview function swiping right as soon as you pull up the app which is a tad quicker than using the touchid to fully sign in before viewing balance info one other issue id say is the inability to view your account and routing within the mobile app on desktop website you can view this info which ive needed to aquire a few times in the past and i was hindered in doing so until i could get to a computerother than that the application is very user friendly super smooth and well coded its a pleasure to have a reliable banking app at your fingertips,1i wasnt a huge fan when chase acquired washington mutual with zero percent interest bearing checking and minuscule interest bearing savings accounts but the convenience of the chase mobile app is the bomb and makes up for all that quick pay with people who dont use chase  killer beats paypal and whatever else is out there bill pay is a breeze photo deposits of my checks never a problem transaction history pretty straight forward theres basically not a single thing that i can think of that you cant do via mobile app and the interface is just awesome straight forward and intuitive and fast not buggynever crashes,1this app does very appy things and it does them consistently plus it rarely slows and never crashes since its for your money thats a great thing despite all of its app trappings its existential appiness as it were it does not stream video or organize your playlists or feature voice guided street directions the way some other apps often do so please do not expect these things from this app until at least the next update however if you only want to check your balance or balance your checks then this just might be the app for you i would strongly recommend this app over any thirdparty chase banking apps as those would theoretically only exist to steal your money,1update latest version or update wont allow me to download and update the app im not sure what changes or modifications were made but i hope it is to streamline and allow more features via the app it has a clean interface but could use more functional services and a more efficient app i dont keep a check register and this app makes it simple to keep up with your finances and bank balance  chase integrates all of your accounts and views in one place although some of the navigation throughout the app could be made a bit smoother and some items could have a larger button otherwise makes this easier to keep track of your income and expenses  great addition to your banking finances,1chase listens to their customers their app is very easy to use i can deposit up to  in checks daily can transfer funds within my own accounts or schedule a payment to others including nonchase members using quick pay and i can pay bills anytime anywhere i am a project manager and cant afford to lose any time by having to travel to the bank the app allows me to handle my personal accounts quickly and securely speaking of security once i set up alerts these are immediately displayed on my smartphone keeping me safe from fraud i travel frequently for work and have never had any issue accessing the app i also love that chase schedules maintenance during times when most people are not inconvenienced one last thingwhen hurricane sandy hit our state chase immediately sent a notification that the safety of its customers was the number one concern and priority and that if we needed an extension on making a payment they were happy to adjust the due date with chase i feel that they are customer oriented and because of that i will remain a loyal customer,1great app only problem i have and the reason for not giving it a  star rating i have a united mileage plus credit card through chase the app allows me to view my credit card balance along with my checking savings accts but after the latest update the app no longer gives you your remaining credit available when you touch current balance it shows you all transactions including your most recent when you touch credit card it used to show your available credit remaining limit on your card last statement balance etc now it just shows you your transactions including your most recent if they would fix this issue im in for a  star rating everything else about this app is great ,1chase bank is very inconsistent with their actions in example for the last  years the several hundred checks that i deposited always gave me partial credit for the check until it cleared  today though  a monday when i deposited  a chase online banking check from a reputable business and i was given no credit i got on the phone with customer service as well as went into the branch where i deposited the check in total i talked to  people who all in their different ways told me what i already knew the check will not clear until tomorrow  and they could give me no reason why so i left there a loyal customer of  years being in the awkward position of only having a few dollars in my account at the timethe exact reason i descided to deposit the check in the first place and i had to choose between putting gas in my vehicle to get home or eat dinnerway to take care of your customers who trust you with their money chase,0at a glance the app is great to keep track of your accounts it has a great feature on the main menu to search for nearby branches works smooth been using this app for years now no complaints although from time to time transferring was unavailable which is a chase problem not the apps fault it has some minor bugs and crashes that could be corrected unaware with issues other may be experiencing perhaps the developers should take a look at that my phone is restored from back up so that may kill any new bugs that a iphone used as new may have  although i have never had a big issue with that just re open it and its good to go overall good app its always great to wake up on friday mornings to a chase notification,1i am not able to consistently access my chase app when i log in only some of the time i get an error saying basically i cannot access you account at this time while the app support tried to help by telling me that i must not have the most up to date download for my iphone i must not have the most up to date app and that i must not be connected to the network although i do have the latest iphone update tried redownlading the app on the network or g and i know i am connected to either the network or g as i can access other apps lately when my app updated there was a touch id option which was working for a while but the log in screen on the app reverted back to no touch id option i had to redownload the app yet again and it worked bit for how long,1this app always worked amazingly for me i use it to pay my bills transfer funds chase quickpay basically everything as of lately however i havent been able to log in consistently its about  now where when i log in either ill sign in right away or itll just load forever and i have to exit the app there definitely needs to be a log in fix also please get rid of the awful wifi reminder every time i launch the app i dont need to be reminded every time that turning on my wifi is better for location accuracy now granted i dont know if this is a phone setting or an app setting but it never happened with chase mobile before and it doesnt happen with any of my other apps fix the log in consistency and this app is  star all the way,1ive been using this app for couple of years now and never had any problem with it i also use several more bank apps for my credit cards an such and chases app is as good as i expect it to be u can basically do anything from depositing a check in your account by taking a snapshot of the check to wiring money or anything else you can do on a regular browser on your pc it may have a glitch or two at some updates but they usually fix it the next time im overall very satisfied with it and appreciate the fact that i dont have to fire up my computer to do anything with my bank account great app smooth and intuitive interface,1i love chase bank and of course i love this app this morning i received a text about a fraud alert they ask you if the transaction is familiar to you or not i replied no and immediately received a text saying that customer service will contact me in a few minutes or i could call them i told he number provided and before i could i then received their call they said that they denied the transaction and they blocked card and are sending me a new one the service is amazing i could receive and send money easily deposit checks check transactions anytime anywhere and more it just makes me feel good having this app on my phone love it,1ive just finished reading the reviews for the chase mobile app dont know what those other foos are doing to make their apps behave so badly ive used this app multiple times a day for the last few years to access almost every feature and it behaves flawlessly i like it so much better than going to the full online banking site which i dont even use anymore im using it on apple products exclusively so those of you who have to change your password every  days or losing touchid have a problem w something outside your device no im not a chase employee an app developer or a chiphead im just an average user who loves this app ,1first of all this is a must have for anyone whos got a chase account this app has proven to be one of my most usefullto the developers with the most recent update ive noticed an issue if go to start the app and sign in i get to see my accounts and money as usual no problems but when i open up the app again after a while it will take me directly to my accounts page without having to sign in it shows everything only for about a second then brings up a idle timeout warning and jumps me back to the login pageif you could make it open at the login page rather than giving me the idle timeout popup with all my account info clearly in the background that would be great,1although the app works for most things the management of alerts needs some work for example if you have  credit cards and there are transactions that qualify a preconfigured alert the app does not differentiate between the  when it comes to displaying the correct cards page for its alerts so lets assume that on my last access of the app  days ago i checked out the alerts for card now if  new alerts are processed today for card when i log into the app the alert display still shows the page for card and erases the  new alerts from the app to actually view the alerts for card i have to switch to the other cards page this totally defeats the purpose of putting the number inside the app and also on the icon,1you guys had the best ever app until you changed the color theme why didnt you just leave the smooth flow and color theme the way it was and just add the new features i dont use it as much now the old app was much better looking i do like the features but the color theme is terrible much harder to read the white background with black thin font is not easy on the eyes the blue background with white bold font was much easier to read  the layout was much better and flowed much smoother it looked more professional this version looks like someone is learning how to build a website   i always made comments that i love this appcause it was simple and easy to navigate thru and pleasant and professional looking please pleasekeep the new features but go back to the old color themeand layout then we will have the best of both worldsthx cindy,0this app is fantastic i use it almost daily to check my account balances transfer money between checking and savings and safely and quickly send money via quickpay  the app loads and responds quickly almost never has problems or issues is super easy to use even if youre not super tech savvy both my parents and even my grandmother use it almost daily and has a clear and intuitive layout and design at least to me i do wish i could select and see details of specific transactions in my account activity like being able to view a check but that one small potential improvement aside highly recommended for anyone that banks with chase,1chase has lead the way on innovative development of its ios banking app and the latest addition of touch id is the last piece finally in placeone important request would be a way to add our own debit memo to the available balance page when we use our chase debit at locations like gas stations when they only hold  in other words our available balance is misleading as it cant show our own initiated debits from all sources not just chase we should have a way to add a pending debit item ourselves to provide accuracyone other request would be that a available balance option be added to apple pay when choosing your chase card as your payment source ,1works every time works well and has many options no app is as good as this one hands down i can use my fingerprint to log in deposit checks in front of the client and give it back to them immediately check balances without signing in make transfers oh the list goes on and on  you can read a list of what the app does but the fact that it is so userfriendly and works and is secure and is convenient thats what youre wanting to know from me well its true and im just a navy veteran single mother own a housecleaning business with two college degrees in medicine and computers but im also  and a recovered alcoholic who can be forgetful so i use this application to help me with my banking and its great,1if you are a person who carefully tracks your financials each month this is not the app for you the app does not feature a clear demarcation of card activity from one statement period to another charges andor credits are listed in a neverending scroll there is no way from this scrolling layout to determine where your most recent activity starts or stops the app does feature one small ledger that lists current balance and statement balance but it is lacking a recent activity line  if you are a person who carefully follows a monthly budget you have to manually subtract those two values to determine your recent charges personally i expect a credit card app to do all the math for me  chase if youre reading this  take a look at amex to see what a clear user friendly credit card app looks and functions like,0updating again and for the same reason as before  star ive rated this app three times now because its great but it never stops asking to be rated even if you write a review or say no thanks that request for a review delays or in some cases even prevents finger print access which is one of the apps best features so  star update  star because it wont stop asking me to review the app after i already had as previously mentioned this disrupts the finger print login otherwise i love the app everything about this app is great except for one thing until you agree to write a review it asks you once every  hours to write one at launch overriding the fingerprint authentication and making you write in your password that is annoying its like saying here is a perk for convenience but only if you write a review so any app that asks for a review gets  stars by default for being annoying,0i like everything about this app except for two minor issues i have multiple chase accounts and as expected the badge shows the total number of alerts across my accounts  however when i first go view my alerts which shows them for one account at a time the badge disappears immediately  it would be more helpful if the badge didnt disappear until i viewed the alerts for all of my accounts  imo once i view an accounts alerts the number shown in the badge should then be reduced to the total number of alerts across the remaining accounts not yet viewed when i send money via quickpay if my memo surpasses some threshold length i cant see what i am  typing anymorethank you,1ive been using chases app since it came out and am very happy with its continued development even though i live and work near plenty of brick and mortar branches i love depositing checks with my phone configured alerts have saved me from going overdrawn more than once and having all my accounts visible helps me see the big picture and do those emergency transfers my two complaints i cant see my recurring payment settings i prefer to arrange auto payment all from chase rather than with each payee but i have to use a browser to manage recurring payment settingsthe page flow of alerts makes no sense go to alerts and see a summary swipe left to see a specific accounts alert count swipe left again and youre back at the summary swipe around some more to see random alert info i feel like im playing some dull postmodern zork with my bank okay i admit this is not an accurate set of steps but it conveys the way i feel when i try to drill down on alerts and that is all that mattersto get that fifth star from me the presentation of alerts has to be simplified or a million bucks could show up in my account,1by far the best banking app out there chases app is quick easy to use amp works very efficiently seeing as i now live in the middle of nowhere montana there is no chase branch anywhere remotely close to me but having this app makes my life so much easier without the torture of having to change to a local bank absolutely love the quick deposit amp i never have a problem with it this app makes it so easy for me to manage my checking amp savings accounts and any transactions i make i have been using this app for several years and with how simple it is to keep up with my spending amp saving i wont ever stray away from chase they have a loyal customer out of me,1the chase app needs touch id access compared to my capital one wallet app the chase app is not up to par things that chase needs to implement that are great about  capital one wallet touch id access this is a no brainier most of my apps have touch id access i dont access my chase app because i cant always remember the password im using the desktop version to access my account unlike my other credit cards where i strictly use the apps  when i use  my capital one credit card the transaction displays immediately on my app and phone through push notifications this is really helpful because it is gives me real time transaction info and also helps keep my other budgeting apps uptodate since they are linked to that card with real time notifications i can immediately react if an unauthorized transaction was to occur this provides a extra level of security the main reason im using chase is for their reward card if it wasnt for that i would continue using my capital one card because of the app and similar card benefits they offer  please look at your competitors and see how they are using apps to improve their customers experience i have several other credit cards and downloaded all of their apps chase seems to have put little to no effort towards their app,0the chase app is quite userfriendly approachable amp  seemingly intuitive while the app offers a robust assortment of both tasks it can perform as well as info it can provide screens are refreshingly clutterfree this simplistic approach to mobile client interface expedites the whole experience in a way that leaves the client confident the task she set out to do was accomplished successfully i have never used this app amp been left with any questions as to whether the transaction was complete nor been left wondering how long it would take to clearetc these amp other answers to questions chase thoroughly anticipates are spelled out clearly as transactions proceed indeed clarity amp simplification are this apps best attributes,1fingerprint verification for all transactions would be good that said it may be intentional to acquire the password for sending money transactions separate from other transactions you can do after using your fingerprint authentication the alert system needs to be updated in particular it would be helpful to have certain alerts that i choose to be pushed onto my phone screen i seem to have difficulty getting notifications without having to get into the app and looking at messages also every message they send are flagged in an email that says weve sent an important message when in fact they are just unimportant status messages about something that i did  when you call everything important than nothing is important and thats not good lastly the user interface needs work phones are small devices and way too much space is taken in the display there could be a much more compact view the listing of accounts does not need to take a quarter inch roughly per account per line i should be able to view a good listing of accounts taking perhaps the space of a  point character as opposed to the waste that is occurring right now,1love the convenience of banking on the go the only suggestion i have at this time is to be able to print your receipt after doing a transfer from your phone i take a screenshot and then print that i have to brag about my branch and my bank officer he goes out of his way to help my husband and i he has come to our place of business to notarize documents for us when we couldnt leave and needed to fax them before a certain time hes the best in this day and age where everything is  automated this type of personal relationship in business where getting to know your customers takes me back to a simpler time weve been chase customers since it was bank one at that time dont think well ever switch banks,1this app works great and does of my banking i dropped one star because for certain features the app requires us to enter our password again if we are already logged in then why make us log in again just to see our messagesone note on deposits others must be having lighting issues or device issues i have an iphone  and i take the deposit pictures on a black desk mat i havent had any issues even with handwritten checks always compare the routing number and account number that it scans with the numbers on the bottom of the check sometimes signatures cross those numbers resulting in incorrect scans the app allows you to tap the numbers and correct them before submission,1i cant imagine a better banking app i can transfer money to my mom she also has a chase acct she can quick pay to me i can pay all my bills my chase credit cards come up with my checking account i can upload checks it doesnt get much better i have a local bank account too just for cashing checks through the bank where my husbands boss banks because he writes personal checks for payroll which stinks i have used direct deposit for years at chase and gotten spoiled with the money being available immediately this other banks website is not user friendly like chases is i hate it they actually charge you to pay bills on it too,1i dont think ive had problems using this app before its very convenient for me to see my checking amp savings accounts as well as my chase freedom credit card and auto loan i love how it shows all my pending transactions the one thing i would like to alter is that it still shows my old auto loan which has been paid off in full and closed about  months ago and yet it still shows on my app which is kind of annoying other than that i love the features that it has including transfers quick pay mobile deposit and bill pay this app is very easy and convenient especially when compared to that of other banks that i know of,1i do like this app its  convenient great reminders and alerts i would give it a  but there are two big things that really bothers me one is the brief limited info it has on transactions how hard could it be to allow an image of the checks or at least a payee name there in an arrow to the right of the transactions but it just gives you the same information from previous screenthe second thing is the security i love the touch feature using you figure print however you can only go so far before we are forced to enter out pin if we want to transfer money or pay a bill you must enter your pin a finger print is far more secure than a pin number anyone could get you pin but who is going to have you finger printsif those two things could be fixed chase would gave a pretty solid app,0i love the app its easy to use rarely do i experience any problems or delays the only thing thats negative really isnt so much about the apps functionality itself it wont let you open when theres an update pendingwhich can be frustrating when youre in a hurry the functionality and menus are intuitive im always able to do what i need to do and most of the time experience no irritation when using the app the quick deposit is a great feature just a couple of pictures of the checkno going to the bank during banking hourssimple the bill paying feature is great too if i needed space on my phone i wouldnt delete this app,1it appears a recent update to the mobile app has eliminated the ability to see the actual book and available balance for example after making a deposit at an atm my receipt showed that a portion of the funds was available for immediate use however afterwards i accessed my account via the mobile app and did not see the same book and available balance i had to back into the amount shown on atm deposit receipt this prevented the immediate transfer of available funds from one chase account to another using the mobile app as caused another trip to the atm to transfer the funds  this seems to only be a problem with the mobile app but is a great inconvenience when other versions of the app are not accessible at the time,1this chase mobile app saves us time we have  accounts from business amp checking to savings amp ira we can manage all of them plus make deposits transfer money between accounts pay bills receive payments amp send or receive money even to people without a chase account ive had the app since its inception amp they have continued to update amp improve it the security is great i kinda get annoyed that i have to put in my password for transferring money even after i use fingerprint login but it does reassure me that they take security seriously id prefer to have the ability to use my pin to transfer money rather than input my password maybe next update,1the thought of having a convenient place to access toe account deposit checks send money and just have a general overview nor whats going on with your money without the hassle of going to a physical bank is ideal for this day and age however there are far too many quirks that make this app frustrating and useless on far too many days my biggest pet peeve is it takes entirely too long to get updated balances of your accounts deposits and withdrawals wont apply for several days the second thing is it is almost impossible to deposit checks using your phone camera iphone  plus i havent had success yet also requesting withdrawal increases setting up chase quickpay and other services many people need access to daily are not available on this app overall id give it a  out of ,0ive been using this app for over a year and i can say i think this is a welldesigned and easy to use app someone said this app is overprotective when it comes to your banking information and the ability to clean your entire account out theres no such thing as overprotection i like that the chase quikpay thing remembers who i send money to so i dont have to keep typing their email address repeatedly basically just a good all around clean app tip when taking a picture of checks for deposit make sure to leave a border around the check ie a thin rim some background from your desk or table not sure why but this seems to help for me,1when taking a trip to the store becomes a nightmare and embarrassment i turn to my app when making a purchase and it gets declined automatically the cashiers and people in line will assume you have no money but most times that is not the case so i quickly get my phone out log in to my app and verify my funds are available then proceed to let the cashier know something is wrong with their system and not my card its happened twice at sams club and walmart but they will never admit is their fault but i dont mind because i know my funds are available so i simply use cash or another card rather than freaking out about what happened with my account,1i use my iphone to pay my bills and check my account frequently on several occasions over the last few months the app has frozen on the bill pay activity page it does not allow scrolling on that screen or logging off from that screen i can access the side menuofservices list but the links on that menu do not work including the link to log off i was told that the it department was aware of this glitch but that was weeks ago and it still recurs  the only fix other than uninstalling and reinstalling the app which is a real pain is to power off my phone and hope the app resets itself thats also annoying im now awaiting callback on escalated  service ticket number   also annoying so for now this app and maybe chase bank as well gets a poor rating from me,0what i love most about this app is that it allows me to over pay my credit card bill without making me wait until pending items post like other apps do sometimes i just want to pay my bill ahead in case i forget to go back later to pay it and it allows me to submit payments toward a future balance i know in a few days will be there as all the items i am paying are pending and not posted its fast and it also shows me what is pending unlike other apps that just show what your credit line available balance is in comparison to your overall line just to see what you have spent this app shows you all pending and who is doing them,1i only have a credit card through chase however this app is amazing in comparison to wells fargos mobile app im rating this  stars because it allows me i perform basic banking actions without issues it is very aesthetically pleasing and they are adding more useful functionality as time goes on recently they added the functionality to view statements within the mobile app something that i dont think wells fargo will ever do with their web view only mobile app one thing i would like to see in the future is the ability to name your accounts i have two credit cards with chase and they are both listed as credit card,1the app does not force close and the time related to maintenance appears to have decreased from the customer perspective it generally works as expected for viewing transaction activity transfers to and from my savings account and i get notifications the areas of improvement are the push notifications which should correlate to user activity  i dont need alerts if i am logged in and complete a transaction reentering the password and the secure message center if i log in biometrically why do i then need to enter a password to complete a transaction if the biometric controls around my banking information are insufficient to protect my financial data they should not be used at all finally i cannot read anything in the secured message center on iphone s plus it just shows me a blank screen,1a new programmer could do better as a first app worst of all similar apps i use  authorize to get into the app makes sense decide to make a payment authorize again why i just did st century message states could take up to  business days to apply payment even though money from payment source account available immediately receive  emails days later payment finally applied receive another  emails app icon now displays annoying notification badge that something needs to be done to clear it tap app icon authorize to get into the app makes sense navigate to connect with chasealertsview alertselect account find message area

navigate again to connect with chasesecure message centerselect account find most recent message and read it ok second badge number cleared repeat next month or sooner to make paymentwho is giving this pos app  stars,0a little history back in  my friendly bank got bought by chase one of the big bad banks foreclosing on peoples homes decided to switch to my local credit union and let the chase branch manager know he persuaded me to stay telling about their programs to help people keep their homes and how much they valued me as a customer nice so i stayed and one of the things i enjoy most about banking with chase is their online banking interface and this app so easy to use and robust my only complaint is that they stopped supporting the app in os  so i could no longer use it on my little iphone gs  so chase if youre reading this dont keep obsoleting your customers who dont buy new phones every two years,1i like this being able to know at any time what my account is doing also like the alerts so i can take care of my account the people treat me very well and it makes me feel important to them thank you all so much i have been with chase for a while now and i love it i have usually gone through all of my money in my account before the end of the month and i get the alerts that im below the amount that im suppose to be but they never give me a hard time about it when i go into the branch they are always so nice to me and treat me with the utmost respect i love all of you at all the chase branches i have been into thank you for being so great you have my respect and admiration,1the app is helpful to see your transactions send money and transfer from one account to another it now has touch login which is really nice because you dont need to type your password in you can also deposit checks very easily and they go into your account pretty quickly i usually have it deposited by the next day at the lastestwhat you cant do from the app or even a mobile site is change any info of your chase account you forcibly need to be on a desktop or laptop i use my tablet and phone much more so this is an inconvenience when i am updating any info of mine also there are now ads on the login screen for the app which dont affect your login but it does look cheap,1i have no idea what genius thought this was a good idea but chase forces you to update the app in order to see your balance i put up with this for a couple times but now i find that every time i want to check my balance a new update is required i updated the app last week i am not able to check my balance this week without updating when i want to use this app i dont always have wifi obviously people use the app onthego so i have to use my limited data to download the update just to check my balance i never write app reviews but i am so angry at chase for their total disregard for the purpose of their app why do you need so many mandatory updates please stop the mandatory updates or i will seriously consider changing to a bank that will let me check my balance onthego without using up mb of data,0not sure why some are griping let them go to bbampt if after being with them  yrs from back in the old bank of louisville days it still took up to  days for a snapshot ck deposit to register despite any issues ive ever had  cant recall any honestly chase is hands down the very best bank and this is the smoothestseamless bank app ive ever dealt with thats saying a lot given i religiously banked with bbampt knew several executiveswas on a st name basis with them dialing their personal extensions when needing specialized service hated to leave but like the auto insurance industry theres no longer an advantage to remain loyal with the technological advances we now  enjoy,1i use the app for quick references paying my cc frequently and depositing checks right away onthego convenience it has gotten more cumbersome with newer updates though now it is harder to quickly filter cc and impossible to filter checking activity to say compare my xcel payments over time   also a mobile convenience they added zelle cant even be managed from the app a payment i should have received was canceled bc i need to go online to set it up or add the sender or something i would have assumed that something which has a primary function of onthego convenience would be usable onthego  old review five stars i am so happy with the ability to deposit checks and pay my credit card from the app so easy and convenient,1i hope someone from chase is reading thisthe whole reason i got this was to help chase monitor for fradulent activity via frequent balance checks and alert that gets pushed to me for any transaction over   would be great mutually beneficial feature if the data was current but they only report posted not pending charges which means there is a  day delay on charge activity which means any fraudsters can runup to your credit limit before you get any alert i know because despite having these alerts my card got shut down and my wife embarassed at the point of purchase with a declined based on legit activity that just hadnt shown up yet as posted credit card industry needs to get their act together  i just cancelled my citi aadvantage card after  years over a similar issue and am getting ready to go old school and revert to walking around with a fat wad of cash,0chase needs to contact amex to see how its done this company doesnt have their act together i was just trying to pay my new southwest chase card through this mobile app and it didnt work i have already had an external bank account linked to my other chase cards which i used to make previous payments every time i get a new chase card you have to make the first payment over the phone so that my bank account that chase has on file already gets linked well  ladies from chase are telling me that i can only pay my bill if i have a chase bank account i have been with amex for over  years and i cant say enough about that company i guess chase is like facebook and just hoards their profits and doesnt put any of their money back into their internet apps you are worth how many millions chase and you make it difficult to accept my payment dont you want my money,0ive become dependent on using the deposit by phone feature its become my selling point to people when they ask me for bank recommendations  i tell them how convenient and wonderful chase is now however on the current forced release of this app the app completely crashes when attempting to deposit a check at the point of picture taking the app closes not very convenient i thought it might have been an issue with my phone initially so i freshly installed it from the app store to someone elses phone same problem considering the fact that this has been an issue for over a week im frustrated with both the developers for not correcting it and chase for not noticing how this is a giant screw up that should have never lasted for more than a day fix it the bank is marketing this tool to potential customers as a convenient benefit and it doesnt work,0i have been using this app on my iphone gs for a long time mostly to check balance and deposit checks  i cannot recall but maybe one time that the firsttry pictures of the front and back of a check were not good enough for the deposit process to usnot so on my new iphone s  i have only deposited  checks so far  the first time i had to retake the pictures once before succeeding said the first pictures were not clear enough  tonight i had to retake pictures  times before they were good enough to processthe view on the screen while getting ready to take a picture seems to jump in and out of focus a lot  dont know if its the iphone or the apps problem but it is definitely a problem on my iphone,1on a whole this app kicks but on any other banking app ive used in all fairness to the others i left them all behind  months ago bofa usbank becu my biggest is with alerts when you have multiple accounts and multiple users in the accounts maybe i just have t flipped the right toggles but i get messages i thought i had turned off on one account but have turned on in another i cant get alerts where i want them or they seem to revert or get changed by the other account holder i dont know it needs to be simpler and clearer im a tech pro and am frustrated by ithows it for a noob why multiple accounts  usersmaybe the alerts interface could be displayed like a matrix if you had more than one account so you could setupmodify the accounts sidebyside then you would have to wonder what changes were applied to which account just a thought or have the user clearly select an account through a drop list or radio button as a part of entering alerts and then display the account name of the alerts editing screenon a whole great jobkeep innovating,1something that really should be mentioned in the description is the limitation of the quickdeposit feature for high school checking accounts the deposit button doesnt even appear on my screen and now being in college without a car the quickdeposit feature seemed extremely valuable to me fortunately the chase representative i talked to over the phone to inquire about the lack of the deposit button and change my checking account was very competent and kind and now im just waiting for the high school to college account switch to be approved i am very pleased with the features i do have access to however and i love to see exactly where my money is going without having to mess with my computer,1app is convenient and allows you to do most things you can do on full website have used app on my iphone s iphone  and ipad mini and have never had any issues nice and convenient for transferring  from different chase accts doing quick pay scanning checks or just keeping an eye on purchasesdeposits from acct i have pretty much used every feature and have never had an issue on any of my devices froze once or twice an update or two ago but no biggie the only thing i wish it allowed you to do is better manage automatic payments its lets you manage them via app but not all options are available other than that near flawless app,1this is a wonderful user friendly app i have always been very pleased with the chase app for one it is always very accurate and up to date and for that reason i can use it to reliably keep track of my finances they always update the app on off hours as to try and avoid inconveniencing customers amp i must add that i personally like the overall look and fluidity of the new update very nicely done jpmorgan chase i not only recommend this app to anyone who has a chase account to help them manage their money more efficiently but i highly recommend jpmorgan chase for anyone looking for a safe reliable and customer friendly banking institution they simply are one of the best,1having access to my bank account at my fingertips has been so useful in many ways easy access to my account wherever i am has made it very convenient to keep tabs on my account and budgeting features of online banking went to another level when it become available as an app for your phone its amazing how you can deposit checks by taking a photo saves time and gas the quick overview swipe is great way to preview your account when you want to take a quick look at your balance it has made budgeting much easier and helps people be more aware of you bank account especially in these times of credit frauds chase has been very good to me and it keeps getting better,1the accounts with chase automatically show up when you get new accounts  the app is one of the easiest to use  the alerts and notifications available are excellent the only complaint i really have is when you go into alerts to clear the message indicator no messages show  just going into that area clears message count  if you go into each card you can see alerts in this section but new alerts are not clear i would recommend they revamp this and have a section for messages making it clear which account the message was for and leave the alerts section to only creating and managing alerts,1chase app is one of the best apps of all the banking apps i use highly integrative just bought a new subaru amp subaru financing uses chase beautiful how chase incorporated that auto loan immediately onto their app for easy payment including auto populating the various checking accounts ive used for paying my chase credit cards as options instead of keeping those payment options separated for each account amp having to redundantly reenter aba amp account s amp go through that whole process again separately as other banks do chases app is efficient amp intelligently designed amp updated i wish other banks used that same format eg boa whose app is atrocious awkward amp doesnt work properly,1i have the update that came out a few months ago and i must say that it works without a hitch i use it for everything and honestly cannot remember the last time i used my computer  it is true i live by this app and im using the iphone i do deposit checks and use the quick pay rather often the one part i do not like is that chase has made it with quick pay that the money goes right into the account ideally this is not a dab thing  but if you make a mistake and send the money to someone unintended then there is not a cancel or for the recipients to cancel the money it just goes straight into their account thats not cool with me,1initially at start up the ui looks and feels nice very iphoneesk but once you log on to view accounts it loses it nice ui the links are small and hard to manage it doesnt look very nice when looking at transactions within an account its hard to see kind of messy it needs to be organized in a more iphone stile with rows and collumns the find us and contact us links once youve logged on are redundant and dont offer the same nice ui but the find us link when logged on has more functionality then the find us option on the home page you cant choose a certain location to find atms it will only show you atms in your current locationall in all its convenient and i use it often but it needs cosmetic and functional work to be a  start app,1i was really impressed that chase incorporated the quick deposit feature into their app really cutting edge and forward thinking i tested out this feature with my g ios iphone and had a clear pic on my st try and the ocr read the account and routing numbers correctly as well the amount of the check instantly showed as pending in my account my only question is how long will it take for the check to fully process if it takes one business day i would see it as a viable alternative to going to the bank despite the fact that my deposits are generally instantly shown as processed when i deposit in person,1ok review from a blind persons perspective chase has definitely made improvements to allow the blind community to access their accounts adequately with all fields being very well labeled and marked with that being said  they totally screwed one area up for blind people when viewing statement it first showed deposit charge then your ending balance it now shows ending balance then deposit charge for each line this may not be an issue if you can physically see layout it is extremely confusing and difficult for a blind individual to navigate that is the only thing i would change just reverse that section back otherwise i have no issue with new ui it is very easy to get through without frustration,1ive been using the chase mobile app since it debuted its always been one of the best mobile banking apps out there it rarely has downtime meaning you cant log in at all it allows you to check your balance transfer funds between accounts use quick pay or wire transfer you can do a deposit by picture even they even have their numbers listed for easy referencethis last incarnation is more graphically pleasing its cleaner sleeker and more intuitive yes there is much more white space and yes the font is different as is some placements to me though it makes sense overall i love the new app easy graphically pleasingand it works,1up until recently this was a great ap unfortunately its now unusable for those of us out there that still are on ios the only ios that runs on a gb iphone s without crashing it i do plan to move to a iphone  with ios  once im eligible for an upgrade and apple gets through the standard issues that come with a new product rollout in the interim this ap has no use as long as im still on a legacy setupupdate  i changed my password and received a message on my home screen cool security works and all that however since theres no way to log into my account on my ios device i cant remove the notification on  the crap and my banking home screen seriously the ap wasnt even launched when i logged into chase on my laptop the only thing left is to delete the ap from this device ive seen issues with aps before but this is crap,0i tried to reset my password but the all kept saying the new password didnt fit the criteria of  characters  number etc but it did i entered around  different passwords and they all fit the criteria but i kept getting this error i called chase and they said to try changing the password on the desktop site that worked right away using one of the passwords the app previously rejected i asked the customer service person to report this bug she said that chase doesnt have a way to report app bugs because chase doesnt make mistakes with their app she said it wasnt possible for it to be a bug and that i have to report it to my phone service provider that makes no sense the app was giving me an error messages how could that be related to my phone service why doesnt chase have a way to report bugs star for that,0the chase banking app is great from verifying transactions to balance transfers chase makes it all possible and its done with ease navigation is simple and definitely easy on the eyes  i have to say i quite enjoy the timeofday specific greeting whenever i log on i really like that i can set up notifications i have them for direct deposits as well as when balances fall below a certain amount ive been using this app for years and its only gotten better amp better  thanks chaseupdate  thank you chase for tailoring accounts to honor our military  i converted both our accounts and we sincerely appreciate your show of respect,1aside from breaking my shredder after forgetting that the card is metal my sapphire is my favorite cc so far im only  but have an amex and these two are both wonderful as for the app itself it is very easy to use convenient and problemfree as i eluded to above my memory isnt the best and i have a lot on my mind that makes this app so helpful in many ways both by always having everything at my fingertips no pun intended although the app does have touchid access and the reminder function that is very customizable i only review products let alone apps that i truly do endorse or have issues with and no issues with chase or this app,1while the other reviews which say it has problems with navigation information design and the like have a point my beef is with their login process no touch id  one of the simplest and most secure methods of logging in is not available then the problem is compounded by the fact that  mistakes in a row extremely easy to do with small mobile keyboards and big fingers and you will be forced to go through the long and laborious process of resetting your password  no exceptions this is true even if you have quit the app between failures additionally they recently changed the requirements for passwords and without notice my password no longer worked and the application locked me out  requiring me to call customer service  because the password reset feature did not work a recurring problem furthermore the interface for security questions is beyond confusing and quite simply a violation of human interface design standards chase needs to hire competent developers or farm it out to another developer  one with experience in addressing hi design and usability issues finally chase appears to be tone deaf to your complaints on issues with this app  so i dont expect that anything will change as a result of this or any other review,0they always leave me hanging with the were temporarily unable to connect to chase please try again later thank you for your patience message this happens everyday for me no my internet connection is fine i can do everything else on my phone is there a limit to how many times i can check my balance on my debit card or something its not like im checking my credit score even after app updates this still happens to me and this has been going on for weeks the app is not user friendly enough you can only swipe to preview your accounts balances on one phone im under a college student debit so i am under my fathers account we cant both use the swipe to preview feature because i am under him its little things like this that makes me feel like the app does not deserve five stars at all please fix the bugs asap,0im always impressed at the level of information and ease with which i can get around my accounts and it is the perfect app except for the password criteria which does not work on the iphone you have to access it through your desktop or else you are just left in a circular error of frustration while you try in futility to figure out the ridiculously tight combination of lettersnumberssyntax that is acceptable to chase again which is no problem on the desktop but you have to know thats your problem many other password complex apps at least give you green lights when youre going in the right direction and red lights when youre going off track,1has potential but needs work  first what are the little dots about the word more telling me on the lower left of the screen that often have a number on them  you click on them and they take you to an faq privacy wheres an atm page among other things  basically useless unless im missing something sldoz often a number appears on app logo on the home screen  what am i supposed to assume this is for   and while the accounts page is good and shows balances deposits pending etc it would be great if the user could see a total balance for his chase accounts rather than getting a calculator and adding each account up  has a good look but needs obvious improvements  the mobile check deposit is ingenuis,1the major issue i have with this app is that once you install it you are unable to access chases full website instead you are directed to a clone of the app so if you are out and about without your desktop or laptop the only way to access the full site is to delete the app on your phone  seems just a bit ridiculous also the app is great at keeping you updated with your withdrawals it usually alerts me within seconds however when it comes to deposits not so much i get an alert every friday morning which states that there has been a direct deposit to my account no amount is disclosed two hours later i receive an update which gives me my balance it is wrong  of the time it gives me my balance before the direct deposit even though the update for the balance comes  hours afterwards if someone from chase sees this fix this please especially the limited access to your website it is nothing short of infuriating when you dont have access to a desktop and need to get something done there is no reason i should have to delete the app to get access i have had to do this twice already the only reason i keep chase is because i live and work in nyc and they have the largest amount of atms in the city otherwise id take it elsewhere,0everythings where it should be with this app especially with the new updated design layout the best feature of all is as you are checking your sensitive personal bank information out in public you dont always want peering eyes checking out the size of your pockets swipe down for the notification center or up for the quick menu screen and your personal info gets covered by chases  loading splash screen when you load the app then when you let go it returns to the bank info great feature in my book something that should be implemented in other apps would give  stars but couldnt bring myself to it seeing as theres a security breach currently ,1great app in all ways so simple and appealing the only reason why including rate the a four star and not a five is because of the touch id logging in ability its nice a quick to log in to your account however when you try to quick pay people or transfer money or other things the apple asks you to enter in your password for everything really inconvenient and annoying after you logged in to your account using touch id i turned that ability off and just enter my password in once at the log in screen and everything is unlocked please chase change this annoying ability and have touch id unlock all options like the password does thank you,1this app is awesome you can deposit checks check your balances transfer funds pay bills and more from anywhere one of the most useful and convenient apps i have my only suggestion is to make it easier to sign in other banking apps allow you to enter a digit pin to sign in rather than having to type the entire password switching between numbers and letters throughout it isnt a deal breaker for me hence the star rating but it would be much nicer i can sign into my zions bank app about  times faster than i can with my chase app besides this feature or rather the lack thereof ive very much enjoyed this app for a long time now,1i use this app all the time to manage my accounts  it really is nice  the quick deposit is incredible my only complaint is the finger print id it allows you into the app but if you need to do anything else you have to use the pw  in my opinion certain functions should be allowed such as deposit a check or pay a bill with a known payee  it totally defeats the purpose of logging in with your finger print if i have to turn around and log in with my pw i understand certain transactions shouldneed the security of a pw balance transfers payments to non established payees in bill pay mode etc  other than that gripe i like this app,1the push alerts are the most useful part of this app for me i have to make regular credit card payments over the phone so the almostimmediate push alerts give me a little extra piece of mind that my credit card hasnt been compromised by strangers on the other line or even eavesdroppers the alerts have gotten so reliable im even getting less paranoid about handing my card to waiters or unfamiliar websites okay maybe not those shady sites with bizarre grammar or affiliations with nigerian princes however i only use this app for one credit card account so i cant really comment on the banking or checking features,1i have several bank accounts but the ones i move the most are my chase accounts i love how im able to see my different accounts in one loginnot sure why so many people complain about the app i have never had a problem with it my transactions always post at the following second and i am always able to see my current balance displaying accurately honest to god chase is an amazing banking experience for me from day one i have never encountered one single issue with them but then again im an extremely tidy person so i always keep track of my money very well learning how to manage your cash flow is important,1its a great appthats been my bank for at least a decade that i can remember and i have redownloaded this app every time ive had a new iphonei think the navigation of the left side bar when youre signed in is very easy to work with and if you dont need to sign in to do more important and indepth things that being able to slide the sign on the screen to the right to view a quick glance at what is currently in your accountaccounts is quick and easy and a lot simpler than using the chase texting version of it and waiting for that infoand what i think is cool and kind of smart is that if you have the fingerprint analysis set up that it will automatically find sign in if you use it instead of using a passwordwhen it comes to apple watch though chase app doesnt work through it what i think would be neat is if you especially create a thumb or finger print acceptance for the app made for the watch to be able to view the accounts instead of typing in a numbered sequence or anything else password type,1touch id allows the use of maximumly randomized and long passwords  sadly the only thing touch id allows you to do is to see your accounts if what you want to do is to transfer money or pay bills you still need to enter your password with this iteration of the app you will have to enter it each time you change modes so if you want to transfer some cash then pay some bills with that cash you will have to enter your password twice lets say that your password is gafqooqwty would you want to enter that each time mine resembles that no youll store it in notes or hopefully in a password manager then copy it to your clipboard and use it  or youll use a simple password  does the implementation lessen security as a result undoubtedly arguably the app is also now worse with touch id from an easeofuse perspective because now you have to enter the password multiple times and the earlier versions only required it once on entry for now youre better off using the webpage in safari and storing your password in the keychain i hope they fix this in a later version of the app perhaps by requiring touch id for each function,1there should be no reason that features are not supported in the app and must be accessed in a browser it would be extremely helpful to be able to search for past payments in the app aside from this disappointment the app does work really well and i have found nothing to complain about regarding the overall serviceone feature that would be helpful is an ability to link online user accounts allowing for shared access to accounts and payees having all payment histories and payees in one pool is necessary in a household with shared responsibility for paying bills for example if a bill was paid by one user the other would have no visibility that it was paid this is the only other real complaint for the online services,1i like this app because its very convenient to use when you want to check your balance accept transfer and all that jazz but i just noticed ever since i changed my phone from iphone s to iphone + i always get the temporarily unavailable message whenever i need to do a transfer quick pay or pay my bill i dont have a problem accepting but when i need to send out money then thats when the error message pops up now i dont know if its my phone or it just happen at the same time i changed my phone but then this also happen to my so which also changed his phone from s to + also my app is always up to date so i know for sure its bot because i have an older version of the app i hope that issue gets fixed sooner,1the chase app is great as soon as i open it i can see all my accounts as well as my kids accounts i can easily pay them for a chore from my phone as well as make a transfer from my savings to my checking if my balance is low it is also handy for paying my credit card one of my cards has a very low credit  so i have to pay it off frequently i can pay it off while standing in line at costco if i spend too much there a common occurrence so i could still use my card and rack up points another thing not related to the app is the people i deal with at my chase branch are wonderful i just wanted to get that said,1im on the road so much for work that im constantly using the app these days i rarely use the main website anymore while some users are having problems i have yet to have any issues with the current release there are some users who have complained that the developers are constantly updating the app while this is true some of the updates are the result of changes that apple makes and for the app to continue functioning properly it must be updated at other times it is due to bug fixes and or enhancements i personally prefer that the app is updated regularly if for nothing else online security,1how does one see their most recent transactions you have to search for them a simple presentation was not enough their idea of simple is to show pending transactions only then search if you want more transactions shown are you kidding me search by date search by keyword just to see your recent transactions the way to see it is to search with nothing in the search field this is not obvious and is not even given in the faqs who in chases it department thought this was a great idea how did this ever pass the usability test not one developer or qa person said wait this is a bad idea not even the ceo i guess they use someone elses financial instruments yeah lets follow the rube goldberg machine principle the default presentation should be pending transactions current transactions and prior statement transactions in descending date order wait this idea cannot be that simple can it the first page is summary information drill one page down and the default information described above should be presented without the user having to search anything search can be done to narrow the result set afterwards or search on other statement periods hiring someone who specializes in the art of obfuscation to run an it department is a bad idea,0i love love love this app i would have purchased a device solely for this purpose how clever that it utilizes my infinitely handy iphone my previous nsf charges were usually a result of not getting my checks to the bank now i just remote deposit the moment i get them even from my house or if i get a text below balance alert i can make the deposit on the spot  chase just kept me from switching banks i deposit to my savings then transfer because there is a restriction for depositing to a checking with a recent nsfs but with this app i wont have that problem anymore this app does have one downside it doesnt give my daughter a lollipop like the teller always did,1as mentioned by other users there is no mention of your current balance when going thru the make payment steps as i always pay full amount i had to exit find current balance memorize it and restart the steps and fill in current balance so all in all it is less convenient than going onto the website am amazed that a bank of this stature would not have an app that includes cc payments which by the way took ages with functionality at least as good as other credit card apps i mean there have been models to follow for years the amex app for example i looked for a way to give this feedback outside a review but there was no way so i am forced to put it here and i give only one star since i only have a chase cc cant speak about the other functions hope this feedback gets to the right people and the app is improved in the next month,0sad to say that such a great bank cant seem to afford to put  effort in their mobile app i cant access my debit card account number i cant transfer money to another bank card i have to request an authorization to transfer money which no branch can authorize you have to wait  hours for the account to transfer money to a new account look this app is literally a waste of storage on your phone all its good for is to see how much you actually have in your card which you could do by calling the number on the back of the debitcredit card most inefficient app if you could at least let me get access to my account number and routing number that be great but i doubt thatll happen its not even worth one star bofa has much more features than this and they only have one branch where i resideand i still manage to get everything i need chase step it up a little yeah,0 the secure message center  its a wonderful addition to the app but has problem areas it tends to be glitchy and the interface doesnt work fluidly  the secure message center  there is no basic functionality unless im oblivious to it there is no delete option for the messages i like to keep a clean inbox on my accounts im sure a delete button was supposed to be included since there is a deleted mail folder unless its only for expired messages there is no other options such as move and there is no folder sorting option i would like to be able to organize my messagesoverall decent app but does have some issues some might not be bothered by this i would recommend it to any chase customer,1i recently got into the working life after years of job hunting failed interviews and just general life issues preventing me from working i have used chase since i was a teenager with a simple savings account and was excited when they came out with an app however i use a much older version of iphone  the iphone s  due to personal preferences so when i came to find out that chase now only caters to users of the iphone  and later i was furious i cannot afford to upgrade and more than that i wont none of these new iphones appeal to me and plenty of people have told me to hang onto my s for as long as possible im not happy with this stupid update and obvious scheme to get others to buy later versions of iphones this little sales trope is not amusing and now my option if depositing checks is now down to driving full across town to a chase bank,0i just gave a raving review to chase mobile but there was supposedly another customer who had used my nickname  same year amp everything they completely deleted my app amp told me to try again that dropped them a star because i am very wordy when giving glowing reports i also had trouble getting my credit report through the mobile device as it was different than my computer      but other than that i thoroughly enjoy using this app it is very helpful in that i do not have to leave home nor do i have to use my slow computer it was also easy for me to learn how to use but if i am unable to use this nickname i will not leave a review it doesnt really look like they need my help anyway,1this app does most part of regular online banking transactions what it lacks is keeping track of your payment history on the online bill pay section even after paying off chase visa i received another bills pay reminder so i assumed the last payment did not go thru and paid the bill off again i do have other banks apps that when i try to pay any bill they brings up the last payment history and if theres a scheduled payment date but this app is lacking that process i ended up transferring money from checking to credit card card account within chase but it does not allow reversing the transfer i ended up going to the bank to request the transfer but they would not give me any confirmation number or indications for my record,0everything about the app works well and is relatively intuitive the only issue i had was having to reset my password no combination of numbers letters and symbols would take the instructions read that it needed to exceed  characters with a minimum of one number and one special character it does not state that you cannot exceed one number and one special character i couldnt log into the dang app for months and had to call every month to pay finally figured it out this past monthupdate i really hate the password system i tried putting in my old password a couple times and got locked out of my account and instead of taking the correct one days later it still wants me to reset it no combination of letters numbers and symbols will satisfy the reset im very heavily considering closing this account just because of the constant password annoyance,0i tried twice to deposit a check with this app my phone has an excellent camera and the photos were very good it said it couldnt deposit it at this time and i should go to a branch it gave no reason after spending over a half hour on the phone to find out why apparently it did not get the whole account number the decender of one of the letters in the signature lightly overlaps the top of some of the numbers in the account number all the numbers are clearly visible when you look at the check and in my photo  but whatever crappy program they use obviously distorts it so dont depend on being able to use this with all checks  i live a long way from a branch and thought this would be a time saver  not   the very least it could have done is tell me why it didnt work so i didnt have to waste so much time on the phone trying to find out why,0i bank with several banks and this is by far the best app i use it for both personal and business banking i use it regularly to pay bills transfer funds check balances and deposit checks the only time things show as pending is when i make a deposit or a transaction that is with an entity not already identified with my accounts this may not be true for everyone because the bank will hold funds based on your account balances and history even when pending the app gives me a view of what my balance looks like should the transaction go through love the app it makes my life so much easier,1i find that chase app makes banking transactions truly convenient and safe by bringing all accounts together on one screen it provides an avenue for a quick evaluation of all financial accounts and activities it also saves possible trips to the bank as well as serving the environment through paperless banking operations i find that fingerprint access provides a higher level of security than passwordonly access in addition the feature that closes the app after a short inactivity time prevents inadvertent access to the accounts by others in case the phone is stolen or lost during accident access,1this is to address two concerns by other reviewers that this apps photo check deposit feature does not work with free checking accounts  that is incorrect i have a free checking account those two statements were made in early july so perhaps this app has since had that functionality added  i have not yet actually used that feature but i do look forward to it and have successfully installed and registered to be able to do that i would venture to guess that the majority of account holders have free checking so they would be missing out on a huge segment of customers if it didnt work with those types of accounts,1this is such a great app i didnt like the new design that was recently put in at first but its growing on me feels a lot cleaner and everything is easy to find and read i love being able to check my balance at any time especially as i work for myself and payments are scattered so its great to check when i am out and about and see a new deposit and ive always loved the check deposit feature so handy and easy although i dont understand why there is a limit sometimes checks are too big which is annoying because i have to deposit it at a branch but overall i love this app i used it all the time and it works great,1looks like the alerts programming is stuck forcing you to guess which account is needing your attention i have  accounts with different alerts set for different reasons i get an alert and then have to guess at which account to open please make this easier with the next update it would be so appreciatedbelow is my original review it still drives me crazy that i have to complete too many steps to open an account alert open chase sign in alerts check the account that has alert etc why cant it just automatically open the account that has alertthey improved alerts and removed notice saying i dont have alerts when i do but i still have to go through too many steps to find the alert cant you just load the alert that i need to readthis was my old reviewfix the alerts i dont like having so many steps to clear an alert notice it automatically loads my savings account and tells me i have no alerts when in fact i do but have to select specific account that has alert annoying otherwise i do love this app and i have had no problems with depositing via photos awesomeplease make the alerts more streamline on next updatethanks,0had no choice but to update now i cant see alerts in the security section and cant deposit checks as the app crashes every time i try to take a picture no point in this app nor banking with chase if this isnt fixed immediately  its bad enough with all the new rules that have been implemented onsite now you screw up what little you have left that is going for you  will update my review if this gets fixed before i switch banksupdate not only were chase cards hacked by home depotnow on the news yesterday it was reported that people with this chase app were targeted and hacked due to the lack of security in this app  seriously  app is still not working properlystill cant deposit and still cant access the  security alerts i have  so happy bank of america has a banking app  will be switching banks tomorrow thanks chase for getting right on this ,0i am a chase client and i loved this app until this update they took the account activity away for an extremely busy person like myself the activity was very helpful for me to see what has been paid vs not paid and what has recently come through my account now i have to look through a copy of my paper statement which i cant see from my phone i like the additional features they have added but most of this is not very useful to me when im on the go my favorite feature was the account activity please bring that back yes i know the statement just came out but account activity than spans the past  weeks no matter when the statement date is is truly the most helpful please bring it back thank you,1the app works well but some genius decided to change the format if the main accounts page to a new format that makes no sense  business and personal accounts used to be presented in a consistent format  each was under its own tab that you could expand  now personal accounts are presented this way but business accounts have a unique heading bar and then each account has its own tabwhich are nonfunctional ie they appear to be able to expand and contract but are simply links  its idiotic to present personal and business accounts in different formats on the same page and to have items with the identical appearance function differently from on another  i dont know who made this dumb decision to ruin what used to be a perfect format but i hope this gets fixed soon,0the app used to show you your purchases when you clicked on current balance of a credit card and would show you a summary of your statement including current balance amount due minimum payment etc when you clicked on credit card   both options now show all of your purchases and you can click on see statements to get the exact version of what would be sent in the mail on a paper statement  i really prefer the way the app used to work  it was much easier to use if i want to see the complete statement i would look at the one that comes in the mail the purpose of the app is to make it more simple  why have  buttons that show the same thing  i hope this is just a glitch and that it is being worked out,0we used to have  accounts spread over  banks home work amp credit but eventually moved all to chase due to customer service bankatm locations amp ease of use in regards to mobile banking  i cannot begin to explain how this app has mainstreamed the day to day operations of both our home amp business banking and we do use it every daythe only drawback which is very minor and to be expected are the service outages due to app upgrades amp maintenance but even those are few amp far between and scheduled at the best of times to minimize user interferencei literally could not ask for a better banking appthank you chase you are so greatly appreciated,1wow chase has now outdone themselves you listened to customer feedback and now the app has touch id youre basically just dumb if you dont bank with chase for this app alone here was my original review this app has it all streamlined interface virtual check deposit quick pay and more the only thing i wish it had that would make it the best banking app in my opinion would be the integration of touch id authentication devs please include the utilization of touch id in an update pronto im very impressed with how technologically savvy chase is i love banking with them theyre always the first on board with anything related to online and virtual banking please just integrate touch id,1i enjoy the ease of use but it lacks options for example when i want to look for my deposits i have to scroll all the way back to find the date for a cleared check it would be nice if there was a tab for this and it would pull up deposits separately and i could then take a look at what that deposit was ie check cash transfer i would also like to see a subtab where i can select deposited checks to see if checks have cleared yet or if they are pending the other option that would make this app more convenient is to have the option for bill pay and to be able to send payments or schedule them in advance as well as having the option to make a one time payment or repeat it would be great,1 alerts are only visible after selecting an account  we have  personal ccard business accounts so finding an alert becomes an easter egg hunt  just show me the unread alerts and note what account they are related to     secure messages require reentering the password which is just silly  you are already signed in with the password andor thumbprint you have full access to the balances and  within the accounts etc  but you cant see messages from the same bank   how about just accepting my thumbprint again rather than making me find and type the  random character password  better yet just show the messages as i am already signed in,1i really do love using this app i do wish however that we could see our previous balances for each transaction well fargo does that breakdown and its awesome i just hate wells with a passion lol the other thing is our automatic deposits that we have going into our savings to keep it free i would love to have the ability to adjust it up or down or adjust its frequency from this app with the minimum being standard of course  im not a fan of having to be put on hold and pressing a bunch of numbers on the phone just to do a simple task i would prefer to do them myself i find the things above a major requirement for me and my family it really helps keep an eye on things and help assist in saving for our future,1i dont understand why on gods green earth i can authenticate to the app with touch id but then to make a transfer or payment while in the app i have to type in my password why the double authentication it just doesnt make sense if you really want to authenticate a second time for no reason at least allow it to be touch id which is far more secure than a password in the first place i use almost a dozen different credit card and banking apps and this is the only one that requires this double authentication its infuriating especially because i have two bank accounts and four credit cards with you guys im often making transfers and payments please eliminate the double authentication or at minimum allow touch id to be used,1this is a great app i use it all the time and it saves me the trouble of driving to the bank or waking up my computer for every little thing i want to check on my account i also travel a lot and like being able to monitor my banking activities my only complaint is that when you make mobile deposits you can only enter one check at a time i often have five or six and they go in as separate small deposits rather than one larger one the alerts have helped me out a few times when the balance was low and i was able to transfer money between accounts to avoid overdrawing the account you just have to set them up the way you want them,1help again i recently updated my iphone  plus  gb to the ios  and since then i can not open or use my chase mobile banking app ive been able to use it until that point with no problem i had the same problem with the last update i love this app and use it daily i have tried deleting it and reinstalling it calling chase techsupport and verizon techsupport who advised me to write this review so that you may check into this issue  i look forward to hearing back from you with hopes that you can correct whatever issue is occurring since the update would love to know why this happens,1ive been a chase customer for a few years now and have had this app ever since they launched it the app is mostly user friendly for the most part however i do have a feature request borne out of my current situation my boss at my new job does not do direct deposit and instead issues handwritten checks most of which have amounts above the  threshold limit for mobile deposits im now forced to mail these checks to a branch in kentucky because there is no branch near me for longstanding customers there should be an exception made where they can deposit amounts up to  or so instead of the usual ,1i use this app frequently  i like that i can transfer money between accounts  i have  so i transfer money from one to the other because when i make purchases it comes out of the one only  i also like that it alerts me if i am under or over a certain amount  what i dont like is if i am over a certain amount in my account it constantly tells me i have for example more than  every day and i receive an alert  there has to be a better way so i dont keep getting those alerts  i like the security of using my fingerprint but then if you want to make a transaction you still have to put your password in before you do anything overall its a useful app but has a few quirky bugs that need to be fixed,1i had forgotten how much i hated depositing checks at the atm or even worse having to stand in line at the branch i hardly ever have to do that anymore with this app i say hardly because about  of the time i take a perfectly clear picture of both sides and i hit deposit and it sits there and spins for a little while and after  seconds tells me we are unable to connect to chase right now sorry for the inconvenience please try again laterbut i love the fingerprint actuated balance check so i dont have to put my password in all the time chase youve done a darn good thing with this app fix the  when i cant get a check to upload and youll get five stars from me,1ok so i know a majority of people like to have everything at their fingertips today this app is exactly what it is everything banking at your finger tips i love not having to log in to get a quick balance its just a swipe away to check both savings and checking accounts you can transfer from account to account or even to someone elses account i think you may even have the bill pay on this app not sure because i do my bills online still but i will be looking into using the app for my bills  so for a banking app its makes life so much easier and convenient at any moment thanks chase,1this is probably the best app on my phone ive used it for years i have alerts set so i know when my funds are running low it also lets me transfer funds between accounts and pay bills either on a one time basis or scheduled regularly it also allows me to see if a check was paid what my purchases have been and notifies me immediately if a card was used for a purchase i can also stop payments and even deposit checks in the convenience of my home plus theres convenience live support from the us i can also locate the closest bank there is absolutely no down side to this app a must have for sure,1the problems with this app is more to do with how chase manages your deposits and deductions none of which is done in the order they originally initiated which will give a false impression of your balances similarly what is displayed on the phone is not the same as what chase employees see so you dont truly know whats going on until a good while later daysthe app is mostly convenient for paying bills deposits for those it works for ltnewer phonesgt and getting a general idea on whats going on with your account  but chase still operates like most banks not so fantastical and futuristic as the app might have you believe  it has been a useful tool but i think many users want more consistency and immediacy as well as useabilityergonomics,1ive been banking with chase for many years  it was a transition to migrate from paper to online banking  and i dont consider myself an early adopter of technology  but i managed through that pretty well  the transition from online to mobile banking was far easier  i think its really simple to transfer funds from one account to another depositing paper checks while i dont receive many of those these days is easy and fast and paying bills even if i have to add a new payee is a breezeto be fair the chase app is the only banking app i have or have ever used so i cant compare functionality with other banking apps  but the chase app certainly meets my banking needs,1does everything i need it to do shows realtime balance of all accounts including my auto loan i agree with another reviewer in whats not to understand about the payment pending it shows your balance even though the payment you made hasnt finished clearing ex you have  in your checking you go to name your store and pay  for your items the app shows  in your account now it shows the charge and amount pending simply implies the transaction hasnt cleared and finalized and will happen that night when everyones systems update it does the same thing with your chase credit cards love this app,1seems to not work when you really would like it to has issues with scanning images taken of checks often giving an error msg saying image is not clear enough even under well lit conditions with a contrasting background often a problem another issue is forced app updates if there is a update available app is bricked and useless until update is downloaded and install always while away from wifi oh and this mandatory update prompt only happens after you have entered your user name and password which by chases design are both very long waste of time and effort especially if ones time is limited or in the field  both reasons one would use the app instead of visiting a branch,1this is by far the simplest most easy to use banking app it gives you access to your chase bank account in every way possible as it allows you the ability to handle your most common daytoday banking without have to visit a physical branch the ui is easy to learn and simply works where this app excels for me is the quickpay feature which allows me to pay and receive payments anytime anywhere my wife uses another major banks app and has had nothing but issues with their equivalent service they also constantly improve the app which is very much appreciated keep up the good work,1i love chases mobile app at one point i was also banking with wells fargo  and their app isnt as integral as chase i also bank with my credit union and their app is not efficient wells fargos fingerprint recognition continuously failed to recognize my thumb this app is so intuitive the only thing i dislike is the quick pay is a little annoying but  with other apps available to pay other parties such as venmo it doesnt matter you can do everything else on it check your balance your credit score images of your checks find atms near you etc i can go on how great i think chases app is they definitely nailed it,1great app pay all my bills from my phone and i can check my balance anywhere i am but depositing a check via pictures takes about  days so thats useless and these alerts because i have too much money in my account confuses me i cant even read the alert its giving me but those r minor issues for all the big stuff i love it i just wait for an email telling me when i got pay a bill and pull out my phone and pay it no losing checks in the mail no waiting periods simple and fastas for these reviews about it not working after updates or under certain conditions i have no idea what its talking about the only time i cant use it is late at night when its under maintenance,1this app is about what id expect for a banking app  the check deposit via camera is nice  its too bad i cant do the same with cash a couple pet peeves though  theres no way to contact the devs via email which is why im writing this review rather than putting it in an emailalso the alerts are very annoying  im a little ocd about not having outstanding alerts on my apps and the only way to clear them is to log into the app the  go into alert history  it would be nice if simply clearing them from the notification center but im not sure if thats even possible  failing that i want to be able to clear the notifications without logging in  as i see it the alerts are a nicety not a security issue  if a malicious user got ahold of my iphone them clearing my alerts would be among the least of my concerns  at the very least if i do have to log in i want the alerts cleared automatically then or a button on the home screen that does it for me  three very outoftheway button presses is ridiculousanyway theres my two cents  i hope a dev reads this,1this app works great ive used the chase app for many years and rarely do i ever have problems from this app i can do pretty much any online banking that i need to do however the latest update came with a format that is not easy on the eyes too much is going on in the past it was a nice solid blue color that was easy to read now it has the log in screen bounces around when you tap on it and you have a words on the home screen that dont scroll when you scroll the page a third of the screen is taken up by a message wishing me a good afternoon and the date which is convenient since its right underneath my phones date and time simply this is a good app but the latest update has a lot of new design while nothing new was added,1i use chase exclusively for my business banking so i cannot comment on the negative reviews which seem to be oriented on the personal side of things however this app works great with my business account if i were to nitpick the only complaint i could come up with is that i would rather not have a separate dialog for touch id just have it show up on the main screen and let me use that or log in with password i dont want to have to click cancel just to use my password if i cant see check images from mobile that would be a problem for me if it doesnt work but i havent needed it so i wouldnt know,1this is definitely the most used app on my phone i love the convenience of seeing any transaction and depositing checks as well as transferring funds between accts i also love that transactions pop up almost immediately after any wdrawal or purchase i see many complaints about having to enter your pswd between transactions even after the touch id has been initiated but isnt it the same when using an atm you must enter your pin after any transaction its just a safety precaution people really need to ease up i love the app and it works fantastic for me except if course when its down thats a bummer thanks chase you did a great job,1i have been a customer for years i like the convenience the online banking provides but this app has good points and bad  i use this app every month and every month i struggle with getting to the correct spot to either view what was paid or adjusting a payment amount  i eventually find where i need to go but usually not with a lot of frustration  like today i can not figure out why there is two payments being made to the same place  i dont have two accounts set up for auto pay  making a change to the payee list is always confusing and most of the time i just delete the whole thing and start over  other than that it seems to be a convenient app,1first off good job on the check deposit feature  this is awesome  i hate going to a bank to deposit checks so this is a huge time saver  the fingerprint login is also really nice  you may also consider integrating the login with rd party password apps like passwordthere is one thing missing and thats reporting a lost or stolen card  this is a gaping hole in both the web and the app  both referred me to the phone loop  the most frustrating thing about this is that a piece of sr century technology is telling me to go back to the s  i cant figure out why someone would decide to invest in the phone loop rather than the app or the websiteotherwise good job,1writing review takes time i rarely wrote app review even if i very much dislike an app simply uninstall right why bother spending extra time to review so this is the rare case i feel compelled to express how much i am satisfied with this awesome chase bank appthe features i like most are eg scan a cheque into deposit keychain stored password just to name a few moreover the biggest question one should have for a bank app is security did i mention that this chase bank app even change the snapshot when its not in foreground i take this as a strong signal that the team that backs this app is extremely serious about security i cannot be more satisfied,1chase has had the best app in my opinion for some time now it just keeps getting better two small suggestions though to help take the app even further add thumbprint icon on the home screen of the app incase it doesnt pop up when the app is first opened then we can trigger it add the option on the app for clients to check their fico score amp credit report free of charge adding that service and feature will help the bank see into more clients credit and pre screen them for possible offers to loan money and credit cards while allowing clients to see and better maintain their credit as well,1i am really happy with this app and the sense of security from it and from chase in general i moved to a state that doesnt have chase regulatory reasons but i want to keep the chase i am in tech and the negative reviewers dont seem to explain how much space is left on their phone how old their ios version is how many apps are open etc i close unused apps have more than gb available on the phone and all apps and the ios are fully up to date  no chase app problems scanning deposit featurethis function is excellent and accurate the only complaint i have as of today is both the ceiling for  deposits on business accounts and the overall lack of knowledge by banking employees as to how much i can deposit a day and what the maximum is based on account type suggestion there should be a system to allow historic account holders a type of graduation to larger deposits per day and per  days chase consider better employee orientation internal department marketing and education streaming internal and cross training employee incentives and awards,1i am on fixed income and for a period of three months this did not even work for me now every time i am very low on funds it stops working and tells me that theres something wrong with chase and of course when my credit card is due i have full use of my app after that its send a deposit in with the home healthcare person and take an hour out of my time every week no photographing checks gosh no that would be too easy for me and they wouldnt be able to catch me in an overdraft make it hard on the other ladies who were on fixed income charge them  whenever we get a chance and make the equipment not function properly when she gets down to that potential overdraft amount i wonder how much they paid the guy who created this idea of screws the ,0this app is terrible from a credit card standpoint i dont have chase banking but all of my other credit card apps give me all the information i need due date amount due points whether i have paid the minimum payment that month etc right on one screen in the app this ridiculous app gives me my balance debits and credits then forces me to look at a pdf file of my statements for any other info i need i would expect this from some crappy credit card company but not from an bank as huge as chase like i said every other credit card i have  different companies have interactive apps that give you everything you need to know without reading through a statement every time its not much to ask  with all the money they steal from people you would think they could build an app that actually does something,0i have been using the app for a few years and i just have one complaint i have  accounts that all get notifications in the notification menu and they all get lumped in together i have to open each account and see which account has notifications i wish that each account had the number of notifications listed such as the iphone mail accounts have i monitor  different email accounts from my phone and i can tell right away which email address has how many new emails rather than opening up each one like i have to do on the chase app for the notifications i wait with each update hoping that they fix this still waiting,1i used to love the chase app banking was great user friendly easy amp quick i never had any issues nowugh i hate the new look its horrible amp i wish i never had to update its already caused me issues with overdrafts they show your balance on the top banner but not that noticeable your eyes go right to the breakdown amp i think your balance amount should be the biggest why is it not only the smallest  but off to the side under the description its misleading amp confusing at first glance amp just absolutely annoying i love chase amp they resolved the overdraft issue crediting my account but i cant have a mobile app intended to make banking easier amp quicker cause more delays amp headaches  if the app stays like this i will have to switch banks luckily theres many in my area amp although id rather not have to switch if it means back to easy mobile banking then thats what ill choose,0on a good day checks will deposit without a problem  times if the check is anything but perfect it will not be accepted folded corner large signature etc this is specific to chase because i give those checks to my husband to deposit to his usaa account which deposit without a problem however after this required update checks will not deposit at all when i go to click the use button it does not move forward it does nothing if i click it again it switches the actual size mode i tried reinstalling the app killing it etc with no results with the closest branch an hour away i rely on this app i put up with the consistent inconvenience because i usually like chase but this is getting ridiculous now so i will be pushed to switch banks im tired of dealing with it when i see other banks mobile apps working much better,0this was a  star app for me  one of my most used but recent change happened with mobile deposit where i can take photos of front and back if check but neither will respond when i press either the use button or the retake button the  buttons are there just as before but they no longer respond to touch like the did before  so functionality has reduced with update im very surprised this kind of miss could get past chase mobile app qa amp testing  once those buttons start working again this will be a  star app again for me loved not having to go physically to the bank to deposit checks but looks like ill have to go back to doing that again or deposit into other bank account using their working mobile deposit,0this app makes life so much easier ive always loved the chase bank theyve been taking care of me for years and this app makes it all the more convenient and awesome to have chase bank everything i may need is provided some glitches are encountered rarely though and nothing ever unforgivable love that i can deposit checks within  minutes so so so convenient i cant say that enough i can check for branches around the area and i love how they send me notice when the app will be down for some fixing very considerate the app is trustworthy i never felt like my account wasnt secured  star because i cant think of any complaints,1i love the app its simple and easy to use i gave it  star because of its user friendly but not the chase quick pay feature this my  one complaint if and when you want to send money you can but the recipient cant accept unless they are near a computer my daughter was in hawaii and she lost her debit card leaving her with no means of cash when i tried sending her money to a friend with chase quick pay it would not allow her friend to accept the transfer through the app the error message popped up said she couldnt accept transfer and that it had to be done via desk top computer otherwise i would have given the app a  star chase please improve the quick pay acceptance feature,1this app works fine for what it does but honestly it doesnt do much the features are very limited other banks and credit card companies are expanding their already extensive app functionality to be able to suspend a missing card and change the card design chase well i cant even redeem points through the app i have a hard time navigating to just look at the balance and due date there are two buttons and they both do the same thing take me to my transactions right away i liked it better when the two sections did something different one would show you transactions and the other would show you balance due date available credit now you have to take an extra step to get there i would like to see a bigger update in the furture,0i am a loyal customer of chase have been using the app ever since it came out i have no major concerns but as a consumer i would like the ability to search for a transaction deposits transfer withdraw purchase payment return refunds etc i have struggled many times to look for a particular activity on the accountcredit card and it is a challenge to get the information i need the feature of sorting and organizing a transaction or searching for one would be quite helpful the blue color is in line to the chase brand however a little more work on the visual presentation would be attractive it would also help to show the closing balance of the credit card by end of each cycle before adding on the transaction from the next cycle this helps in understanding the carry over from the last cycle if any please add the ability to modify the contact information once a user is logged into the account from the app the requirement of logging into the account from a desktop to modify information phone number and email to enable accessask for forgotten password should be eliminated thanks  mishi,1this app used to be fantastic but the new version is buggy and unreliable i mainly used it for depositing checks because i work abroad a lot for long periods of time until recently it would work every time but since the last couple of updates its been hopeless  i havent been able to deposit one check each time i try i get a message that the photo is not clear enough ive tried under spotlight lamps on the window sill on cloudy amp sunny days in my office at home  basically everything i can think of ive also uninstalled and reinstalled twice nada the one thing i really used this for  and the thing that made it better than most other banking apps  now doesnt work so for me this app is now pretty useless fix the check deposit bug and ill love it again,0i enjoy the convenience of paying the bills in just a few seconds without envelopes stamps etc  the ability to deposit and transfer funds without a trip out us huge too  only a few things i would like to see improved  first the area on the electronic checks where the breakdowns or additional info is written is an awfully small fontoften missed by the payee and credited wrongly  and the other thing the phone ap does not give the ability to make reoccurring payments and has some search limitations that you have to go to the big brother computers to make happen  however still a great ap,1i like the app for the most part except for one annoying glitch whenever i am logged out automatically due to a timeout the touch id login feature is unavailable so i have to close the app and reopen it so that the touch id can refresh the touch id login option should always automatically pop up any time i need to log in but it does not a simple way to fix this would be to add a touch id button so that the user can initiate the touch id login process without needing to reboot the app all the other banking apps i use have a touch id login button just in case the touch login feature does not automatically pop up fix this issue and this will be a five star app,1i agree with the previous review from meelahj the balances are not accurate it says that the available balance includes pending transactions but once the pending transactions are posted we mysteriously have a negative balance or are over drafted it started happening only recently after there was some maintenance shutdown during a weekend the site looked different after that and the issue started at the same time we used to have the same problem with bank of america which is why we moved to chase we were happy for more than three years but are having same problem here now time to move back to credit unions and good old checks and forget about the convenience offered by big banks how can convenience matter when you are always waiting for days for the pending transactions to post so you will know what your real balance is,0make no mistake this is a great app for most of my banking needs the only thing it doesnt offer my other banking apps do is the ability to view my credit score within the app i have to log in to the site to do that which isnt always the most convenient the reason for my star review is this chase has really improved the app a lot and as such it has to be judged on the high standards it has set for itself i do not like how the app constantly asks me for a review almost every time i open the app  out of  times then when you dismiss the request for a review it wont even let you log in with touchid why you would think that the app would go out of its way to make the experience more seamless and fluid given the interruption but no also i just found out that itll let you log in with touchid if you agree to leave a review chase please do something about this if i dont want to be bothered then dont constantly get in my face about leaving a review ill review the app when i want to all youve done is get in the way of my banking experience other apps do ask for reviews but not as frequently as this and if they interrupt you in that way they at least let you log in with touchid fix this,0this app is fine i have never had another bank besides chase so i cant compare but i can see all my accounts and my credit cards on the same page i think its pretty user friendly for the most part checking balances transferring and other everyday functions are simple i love the check deposit option i dont have to make a trip to the bank to deposit my checks one of the reviewers mentioned a ton of extras on the left menu which is true i dont use half that stuff but it doesnt bother me either if you have chase get the app why not,1as a customer and a business client of jp morgan amp chase bank ive seen them flourish in customer service excellence everything from bank branches headquarters phone and online banking not to forget quick deposits with the phone camera application its not just this that makes chase a leader in the financial institution but also its not as harsh as its competitors when it comes to ridiculous fees for over drafts and etc other banks are only in business because they use our money fid insured so they can make money off of us the getting rich scheme with applying overdraft fees doesnt help its customer base it only hurts them big league,1i have used this app for about  years and i have to say it is as reliable just as it has gotten better i can make all of my bank transactions on my mobile device which is very convenient the only thing chase has to work on with this app is the ability to do everything you can do on the website for example on the website you can set up automatic transfers to a savings account you cant do that with the mobile app if you can then well i am unaware of that feature but because of the fingerprint login feature this is now my preferred method of making bank transactions,1if youre looking at these reviews then you must be chase customer and if so dont even hesitate to get this app while it isnt perfect what app is it does what it should very welli have been a chase customer for many years and have had email alerts since they have been available so when i saw my daily email showing an unknown visa debit card transaction i used this app to log on and check it outit turned out that somehow my card  had been stolen i immediately contacted chase they cancelled the card filed a charge dispute i did have to wait for the pending transaction to clear first and chase credited my acct right then  woot,1it does the job and has most if not all the functionality of the previous versions but i wish the colors were simple like before this version has a picture of a lawn as the background and i always feel weird looking at it because it doesnt look like a banking appalso the rows for transaction entries in each accounts are too tall so only few information can be displayed at one time it also doesnt have a running creditdebit balance only the amount of each transactionsi like how i can make credit card payment and online deposit quickly with this app i use this app more often than the website version,1i have been using the app for years chase has been making improvements but they still have a way to go for such a large company you would think that they would be able to afford to make a really great app one easy suggestion i have is around the alerts access when i get an alert i want to be able to tap the notification and be takes directly to the alert instead i have to log in and end up on the main page from the sidebar there is an option for alerts when i tap that it then reveals a drop down menu where i can view alerts or manage alerts the manage feature should become a button within the main alerts screen it should only take one tap to get to your alerts,1i have always liked the chase mobile app it is leading the way for banking apps i love all of its features and how they stay up on top of the new technology every year the finger print log in is awesome and much easy instead of typing in a long password to see your account on the fly i loved the scroll left feature as well that shows you a quick way to see your total money without login in at all the app always works great and i never really have any problems with it im just glad chase is spending the money and taking the time to develop a great user friendly app for their customers well done chase,1i have been using the chase bank mobile application for the past almost  years now and i must say that it does a fantastic job it is easy to use and very quick and seldom hangs up it has a quick preview option as well which is the most useful feature as most of a majority of the times use the app to check out balance if you log in you have different features like depositing a check just by means of clicking and sending the image chase quick transfer etc highly recommended to anyone with chase account who has not tried this app for sure you will love this app,1this is easily one of the most reliable apps ive used in a long time the only time its ever not worked is when theyve actively been performing maintenance work on it otherwise its very snappy the ui looks and works great and allinall the app looks wonderful with all of the photos that have been added to it so this app definitely deserves to be in your lineup if you bank with chase apple has even worked with chase to enable logging into your chase account with your fingerprint which has changed how quickly i can login to my accountseriously its like  seconds seriously wonderful app,1what can i add to the overwhelming majority okay here it goes i get peace of mind from knowing that i can access banking from a mobile phone something that one generation or two of third world citizens can only hope to use in their lifetimes i am thankful that jpmorgan chase really has made it as user friendly as can be i still frustrated sometimes at an atm with the deposit features because i havent used them frankly kind of like all the features of my old car that i never used and i dont know why i had it anyway anyway thanks great app you did and are doing a great job and heres another five star review have a blessed one,1i like the bank and the benefits of being a card holder but this app gives me anxiety i completely understand the thought behind the password security regulations but come on this app drives me nuts when i cant remember my password i have to go find my card type the number in stand on one leg and start the process of resetting it it gets better there is like  rules for creating a password i ended up having to write a sentence as a password just so the app would take it i also dont like that i cant easily see when my payment is due like most other apps it just opens boom theres my balance heaven forbid you try to go to payments to see a due date because then it tells you you have to sign in from a desktop and sign this and that up id rather just wait on my monthly statement it makes me that mad great customer service though,0i use apps from several financial institutions and most are quite good with the chase app being almost as good as any i get instant notifications of all credit card charges  usually before i leave the cashier displays of account activity and information is very good i like the use of the thumb print for account access so i dont have to key a password wish the app had a setting to retain the iphone notifications and not set alters for the notifications in the app to treat notifications like the citi and amexp apps also wish the app had an option to lock and unlock a credit card that may be lost  like the citi cards support i use an iphone  with ios ,1normally i find it hard to rate apps but i have to say this is one of the best online banking apps among all banks i like  the online transfers i like  the fact that all your financial transactions is at your fingertips i also like the alerts and how effective they are i also like the fact that this bank is always updating their apps to serve their customer better i recently close one my bank accounts just because i think they dont know what the doing when it come to online banking i wont mention the bank nameover all i will say chase is one of the best banks i have ever  bank in and i will always bank here,1this app has been a lifesaver since i have been living in china for work for the last  years the best thing is that i dont have to have a vpn server link to access out of country apps china has a very particular firewall ex no facebook no twitter no instagram etc so many apps dont work without special access with a vpn server access i use quickpay every month to receive rent money for my property in missouri and also set up payments to my bills that i need to cover pay my mortgage also so i get an even better deal on my checking account thank you for this app its great for what i need,1i think this app is fantastic all my information is accurate when i go to deposit my checks through my app i never have a problem ive only had to retake a picture of my check once i havent had an issue with doing deposits through my i phone and its a  plus it also worked fine when i had my i phone  this app has never given me any problems i also transfer money to my cousin and she transfers the money right back to me weve had no problems with that either ive been using it for almost two years,1loved the fact that i can deposit my checks so easy and at any time even when i cannot sleep at  am this app gives a limited view and use of your account one of the reasons i say this is  because i have to choose personal or business once i do i cannot pay my business credit card out of my personal account for the personal purchases ive made there is a frustrating glitch as well if you have several checks to deposit the app will often turn off in the middle of your transaction besides these two minor issues i use it when its convenient to me otherwise i prefer my personal relationship with my bank,1i am a college student and try to stay on top of my spendings and this app helps very much in that i am constantly checking my balance and keep an eye out on being double charged it has happened a few times and having the app to show the storerestaurant and the person assisting me at the bank made the process of fixing it a lot easier also the check deposit option makes it easy for my to put in my paychecks since the closes chase bank to me is almost an hour away it is also easy to use and works fast my checks are always there by the next day when its not the weekend,1i absolutely love the convenience of chase mobiles app it makes anything related to your banking such a breeze its so easy to keep an eye on your accounts and transactions to transfer funds and even to deposit checks theres no more running to the bank for me i can simply login to my app and in literally the matter of a minute deposit a check into the account of my choosing i have yet to have any sort of security problem or really any kind of problem at all with this application in other words i highly recommend this app and would suggest it to everyone and their mother thank you chase for being awesome,1the app is great because of the option of being able to preview your accounts at a swipe as well as the convenience of depositing checks by phone so i dont have to go to an atm or inside a branch  however its lacking one star because youre not able to view the memonote when you transfer money to accounts there are times when i would need to look back on why i transferred the money and i know i provided a memonote but theres no way for me to view it or find it ive even tried logging on by computer and i still dont see the memonote i provided why provide this feature when you cant view or use it  its like taking a note and sending it to cyberspace,1i will first say that quick pay is awesome if both parties are chase members but this option is a headache of you are not a chase member the banker told me all this great stuff about how anyone can use it but failed to mention that if the other persons email is used with their own bank they have to create and entirely different email to create a login and after doing that none of this can be done via cell phone the person must only create a login on a computer it defeats the purpose of it being an app non chase members trying to send money to a chase member often get errors and are unable to transfer money for various reasons this has become very annoying for the business i am trying to conduct whats the point of having a mobile app if you need a computer to create a login,0there is a stark difference in what you can do with the app and what you can do on the full site seems like all you can do on the app is check your balance transfer funds or pay your credit card i am happy that you can finally view checks that have been cashed against your account but you cant order more checks with the app furthermore there is seemingly no way to access the full site from a mobile device you are always redirected to the mobile site which has the same exact features as the app i wish chase would change that because i cant always log into a computer when i need to order checks or change information on my account ie mailing address,1the earlier versions of this app were always crashing whenever i tried to deposit a check not so any more in fact it now works flawlessly whether making a deposit transferring between accounts or checking balances chase finally got its mobile appact together and i for one am very glad they did i now use the app with confidence no more having to go to my desktop or if im away from home having to wait until i can access a desktop or worse go to a branch to do my account management tasks i gave it five stars and i mean every one of them kudos to the app developers at chase,1i guess im not the only one with the complaint about this app telling me to reset my password every other week or so i dont know about you guys but im running out of passwords to think of first i thought someone was messing with my account because it would state before i logged in that i tried multiple times logging in i know for a fact that i didnt and the touch id feature well its garbage it lasts for about a week then i have to start all over again with imputing the card number to create a new password etc etc etc ive had the discover app on my phone for about  years and never ran into these issues its getting to the point where i just want to close this account because the mobile app is unreliable and to put it in a simple word garbage,0my main use of this app is for making mobile deposits i have two small businesses and a few other accounts and except for some clients obscuring their account numbers when signing their names i never have problems i actually like the most recent changes to the deposit procedure it looks cleaner and will be much more helpful to folks trying mobile deposits for the first time occasionally i will do a transfer and ive never had any difficulties with that either i just wish i could see statements or at least the last  transactions for any account,1i can do almost all of my banking from this app deposit checks pay bills redeem points etc it stays up to the minute with all transaction on my debit card and i never miss a credit card payment because of the helpful notifications the only thing i can imagine changing are the site maintenance issues from time to time the site is down for maintenance without notice which isnt that big of a deal since they are usually up and running the very next day there are never and discrepancies with my accounts i highly recommend this app if you bank with chase ,1this is a good one its clear simple and easy to use there are a lot of options and offerings from banks in general and this app seems to make the process of dealing with cheques and credit card payments very simple getting sms pingbacks is another layer of reassurance that i appreciatei dont much like banks in general but chase have gone through some communication changes in the last few years and the overall experience has been solid i was grandfathered in from washington mutual and have seen no reason to shift to another bank or credit union both when i had money and when i didnt,1i have been banking with chase formerly at wamu  r i p my dear since  at first i was unhappy at the buyout but i quickly found chase to be just as good at customer service as wamu was if you can get their sapphire visa card do the card perks are great and you get a primo level is assigned customer service reps should you ever need to call in lost a card and had a new one delivers to my hotel room in less than  hours everything else chase dose for my banking is also topnotch ive tried opening two other secondary accounts at other banks and closed them because they were subpar compared to chase,1just downloaded app today and made a deposit  wow  after working in the banking industry for  years this is truly amazing  i remember trying to talk customers into a debit card many years ago that was futuristic back then  i dont need to write a check it comes right out of my account is what i always heard  i also remember the long lines on fridays at  pm with customers doing deposit only requests im in awe of this unbelievable technology  if you would have told me i could take a picture of a check on my phone and it would be deposited to my account i  would never have believed it way to go chase  this is awesome,1the number of configurable alerts is astonishing and the remote check depositing is awesome  i just dropped my review by one star because there is no way i can find to request a feature or get in touch with the developer  so i will put it here  when remotely depositing checks there is a point where we have to verify the account number and routing number on the checks  it would be extremely helpful if there was a button on the app that would read the numbers out load so we can verify them without looking back and forth between the check and the app which lends itself to errors this would reduce user frustration and errors and error processing frequency and time by chase,1the chase app for idevice is just one of the many reasons ive been with this same fi for the past  years they innovate smartly and consistently getting tools in my hands to manage my money effectively  they seem to have struck a good balance with managing the risk of such change in a very heavily regulated industry with the reward of happy customers when it comes to new service offerings and i have every reason to expect them to continue the same in the future just like when i logged in today and found fingerprint authentication as part of this app  very nice chase  very nice,1thanks for adding the fingerprint login feature not sure why it doesnt work for other reviewers it works fine for me and im glad you added statement views that helps since i dont often have my laptop powered up so this adds value for me now you need to add the ability to put a hold on my credit card in case ive misplaced it and want to make sure it doesnt get used by an unauthorized person then i can turn it back on when ive found it  and would be nice if i could also be able to alert the fraud department of instances when i am going to use my credit card in a unusual way ie out of the country so that unusual charges get approved,1this app does almost everything but i wish it could dispense cash lets work on that and how about current credit statementswith checking savings and mortgage i can do all my banking my only gripe is the credit card statement doesnt give you up to date amounts that are due or how much youve paid off since your last payment my branch said i have to view statements then go to my checking history and add up how much ive paid since the last period and subtract from the statement cant the app do that for me my iphone has a calculator and its too much work to jump between all the screens,1i wasnt sure why my touch id was working anymore after reading other reviews i realized i wasnt the only one after toggling through my settings on the app i was able to easily enable it with a flip of a switch now i can award the last gold star i have a few liquid accounts and am now enjoying the luxury or quick pay  to receive payments from my clients pay bills and transfer my kids allowance into her account happy camperprevious review i think its a great app however somehow my touch id isnt functional anymore and i dont know how to fix it aside from that it works quickly and efficiently,1love the fingerprint function for password access do not love that its basically pointless since passwords still have to be used to perform any functions within the app also do not love the fact that the fingerprint access window is not consistent there are times that it doesnt even pop up to allow touch id access and i have to clear out the use of the app and open it again love the changing scenery pictures in the welcome screen of the app prior to logging in did not love the adds that blocked view of the pics also the adds seemed to make the pop up window delay and consistency for touch id access worse than it already is,1i love so many things about this appthe ability to use fingerprint verification the account displays inapp deposit inapp bill payment realtime account updates account alerts etc  by comparison i detest the online and app experiences for cefcuno consolidated customer directory cannot pay credit card online unless you transfer from savings or pay a bill through an outside bank customers are only known by savings account number slow account updates etc  chase sets the bar high among the other banks with which ive dealt i feel this app supports that positive experience,1this app addresses all my banking needs with the exception of providing cash  and even then i do not have to go inside the bank the  hour atms are a wonderful invention      i have been using this app for years with no complaints and few malfunctions the occasional glitches to me are simply the cost of doing business on the internet    i am confident that my money is secure and appreciate the fact that routine monthly deposits from a payer in the same amount do not have a hold put on them conversely i completely understand holds put on deposits from nonroutine deposits      in the past decade i have had the inconvenience of writing three  checks only all monetary functions are conducted with my debitcredit card i rarely carry cash and know to the penny how much is in my account     this is banking at its best    i thank chase bank for being progressive and look forward to seeing future innovations     note this review was written by a  year old boomer old dogs and women can learn new tricks,1there is no option for sound notifications when important push notifications arrive how would you know if you had your phone in your pocket they need to add that option for notifications also within the app itself there is a submenu under alerts called view alerts when you click view alerts it takes you to the first account in your list of bank accounts to find which account generated the short youd have to check reach account individually thats crazy of you have many sounds such as checking savings credit cards loans and such why not just show a list of the alerts or me to the most recent alert itself overall its a good app which needs important features to be added,0overall an ok app except for  things  pay bills online and view pending activity is frequently unavailable or takes forever to load and needs to be refreshedreloaded by exiting amp reentering the app  i just had to reset my password and the screens for typing your ssn acct no  and new password were so low contrast that it was very hard to tell where you were supposed to enter this info i retyped my new password  times before realizing a second reenter password box was all the way at the bottom no lines or bordersjust a white box with grey text that was hard to notice amid all the complex password security instructions please improve the clarity and use some borders and helpful colors im so sick of low contrast white and grey designs its not cleanits just hard to see,0i really do like this it makes checking my account and the actions that go on my account that much easier and if i need a bank statement i can just look on my phone and on the app without having to go to the bank like i said before this banking app is absolutely wonderful because it makes it easier to track your system check your money i dont want exactly what youre doing and it also let you know what phones are busy being used with those arent being used and how far a deep you are an overdraft so its actually quite wonderful thing and i appreciate it and i love this app,1the first few versions were pretty good with no problems at all with the recent updates it has become worse the app every about  times of logging in will not recognize fingerprint logins and will ask a manual password entry with a wrong key the first time it will ask you to reset your password the thing that is so inconvenient about this is that you have to have an account number and your ssn with you i have to do this each and every time it does not recognize my fingerprint i have never updated my password so many times in my life i have lost count of how many times i have done this and with every change you lose track of what your current password is i understand that this is for security but this is overkill i would rate this app a zero for inconvenience but i cant hopefully someone does something about this,0i think the experience of banking online a great asset i love being able to get my current balance and what is pending  i like to see my spending history at a glance  and i really enjoy being able to make deposits with my phone camerai look at my various accounts many times a day as i check my balances and see if there are any messages from chase that i need to be aware of its just a great app for so many reasons i can see my statements online everything is userfriendly i love the alerts the finger touch system its very sophisticated and i just love it,1i really like this app it is so convenient to have access to all of my accounts however i would love this app and give it  stars if i were able to use the one touch feature to log on like a few other apps that i use chase will you please consider adding that feature  its a pain having to always type in a passwordthank you chase for adding the one touch log on feature  it makes it so much easier and quicker to get to what i need i also love that i can deposit checks from home sometimes im no able to get to the bank after work this is sooo convenient thanks again,1the newest update for chase was supposed to download on my phone earlier but now i am unable to even locate the icon for chase mobile on my iphone  whats the problem i cant even uninstall the app because there is no icon for me to click on please help me figure this out i strongly rely on my phone for everything the app is awesome when it works i never had a problem with it before the only problem i had with it was the fact that it took so long for the credit card information to show up i have been banking with chase for several years and tell everyone to switch because they are so awesome it would be even better if there was a way to access the full site from your phone rather than being linked directly to the mobile site,0first off this app is useless when connected over wifi not sure if it wont connect via wifi due to security reasons or what but its a pain to have to go into settings and turn wifi off just to log on to chase and then turn wifi back on after im finished and even worse if i forget something i needed to look at while in the app i have to do it all over againalso just for convenience the app needs a calculator in the account window so you can balance your checkbook without having to exit this app to use your phone calculator  i use a separate one usually though it would be nice for on the go if atleast the first issue were addressed and or fixed i would change my rating if both issues were addressed i would give this app a full five stars,0simple efficient extremely useful i use this app multiple times a day and its exactly what i need my only desire is that they implement wider touch id integration it gets a little cumbersome having to switch back and forth between the settings app and the chase app to copypaste my password to do a transfer and if the app logs me out i have to forceclose it and reopen it to get the app to get it to ask me for my touch id if they added a touch id login button like the capital one app it would just make my day nitpicky sure but with as useful as this app is otherwise all the switching takes time other than those minor quibbles absolutely great app,1easy to use and convenient but i have to say that i had to start keeping track of my own money for a month i had a lot of deposits coming in i would find discrepancies in my balance and purchases i would be charged for something and given a balance and then the following week see that same transaction being deducted when i noticed this pattern had to constantly call in to find out where my money went now i make sure that i know exactly what is in there at all times taking screenshots and keeping record i only use the card for withdrawals i use cash to make purchases,1i do love that you have an app and it sits very prominently on my phones home screen ie not in a folder ive just received my new chase card and will use both it and the app constantly i can telli must say though that the app is good not great i do however brim with optimism as i say that because im sure there are more good things comingfirst the app more often than not forgets that i have enabled touch id and prompts me for my password sometimes it remembers but it usually doesntsecond and this may be more of a card thing than an app thing why have i not seen any of my rewards points posted to my account im barreling headlong toward meeting my minimum spend for the k pt bonus but havent seen anything yetthird all of my alerts are being duplicated in the alerts centeri do hope youll view this feedback as constructive bc i have gotten a lot of value from the app and will certainly continue to use it im just hopeful that youll address these issues and continue to work toward making it the best it can be good luck,1on the one hand this app does an awesome job depositing checks and does a good job allowing you to browse recent activityon the other hand it is missing two key featuresfirst this is the only financial app i have that has not yet enabled touch id on the iphone s that makes it lamely behind the timessecond the statements are not mobile optimized the statements should fit the font size to the screen the same way browsing your recent activity does worse the statements are locked in vertical scroll thats ridiculous the only way to make the font size remotely readable on an iphone is to switch to horizontal viewfinally the user should have control of font size through zooming in every app with readable text and it is time for every company to lead the way in user experience by implementing this but if i zoom in on the statements the text just runs off the page making me have to scroll horizontally to read a single line of textthese problems make it virtually useless to access the statements in the mobile app why would i want to access something i cant easily read,1this application is very useful its great how the balances are kept like a balance book that even if the money hasnt been pulled out but its pending it shows the balance like it was processed so you cant overdraft because you thought you had money that was just waiting to be processed its great also how your able to see all your other balances like home car loans and checking and at the same time make payments on them also overall its a great and useful app it got even better now that you have finger print access allowing you to access your account a lot faster and easier,1i havent had any trouble with depositing checks with this app except chase always takes a couple days for checks to clear this is the same at the atm or in person if not cashed i like how fast the app loads especially with touch id enabled there is no jail breaking detection which is bogus on the new citibank app i dont like that credit card payments are red should be green and purchases are blue checking account has the same colors but the flow of money is in reverse i dont like that the list of my wire transfer contacts isnt synchronized with the desktop site i like quickpay but would like higher limits on my personal account my business account has a higher limit overall serves its purpose,1every time i try to log into this app its says my password is incorrect and i get locked out after one attempt it says too many attempts and locks me out  i have to reset my password every single time it is extremely annoying especially when i just want to check something quick i have to go through an entire process to reset my password also the layout of the app is horrible when i need to reset my password it is very hard to tell where you are supposed to enter any information theres nothing to indicate you are supposed to enter numbers or such in the spot it wants you to enter it it would also be a nice to see a running balance after every transaction,1i was happy about using chase mobile app again after not needing to use it in  years  since i was way out in the country visiting my daughter i figured it would be no problem since i was almost an hour away from the closet chase  well to make a long story short i was told i could deposit a money order into my account via the app  i drove  minutes to closest place to obtain a money order  the deposit  i thought was going great but after taking pictures of the front and back of the m oand then hitting make deposit i was told we dont take this type of deposit please take to a chase bank or atm    iwas devastated because as i said before the closest chase is an hour away  i was really devastated over this and really needed to make that deposit ,0when i moved to a new place and needed to find a bank i chose chase on account of their iphone app which was touted loudly at the time on a building sized banner hung across the street from my local branch deposit checks via my phone brilliant  who couldnt love thatmy attempts to actually deposit a payroll check using the iphone have included implimentation of various lights starting with table lamps and proceeding to halogen spotlights  ive even gone so far as to set up a makeshift copy stand in order to keep the iphone steady  no matter what i try or what effort i make however ive never gotten the deposit feature to work  not even oncebut wait a second an upstanding institution like chase wouldnt tout a new feature that doesnt work just to get new accounts would they  wouldnt that be fraud  what  whats that  did somebody just say subprime  fail,0i dont know what everyone is complaining about this app works extremely well i seriously rely on this app more than i do most apps on my iphone my only gripes with the app itself are some of its limitations those being you cannot deposit more than  a day using chase quick deposit frustrating if you have a large check you cannot transfer funds from your chase account to an external account say an external savings account despite being able to do this with no problem on a computer the lack of this feature makes no sense alert acknowledgement its frustrating that the only way to make the badge icon disappear from the app is to navigate to the alert subsubmenu and tap on the specific account with the alert this really needs to be simplifieddespite these gripes chase is the one banking company that i really feel gets it in that they are constantly updating this app to squash bugs and add features its extremely important to me that my bank stays up to date with the latest technology,1basic functionality is sound menu design is improved good job keeping options restricted to the frequent and quick tasks apps can excel atmessages associated with quickpay activity cant be viewed in their entirety users cant write new messages to chase from the secure message centerultimate rewards link points to a mobile site with next to no functionality requesting the full site requires an additional login logging in to the app should allow users to click through to the websites without additional authenticationcredit cards are only identified by their last  digits not the name of the card ie freedom sapphire etcopening a chase checking account resulted in quickpay being redirected to the chase account with no way to restore it to the external account previously used this led to the need for a nd transfer after quickpay cleared in  days to the chase account this was such a hassle that i closed the checking accountthere is no way to view activity for all accounts at once making managing multiple accounts more tedious than it is in other apps,1ive always liked the chase app i think it has a lot of features that are really helpful on the go the new update has been a vast improvement and i like the layout a lot more an improvement id like to see is one that puts the most recent alert as the one you see when you check alerts it always goes to the default screen and thats not always helpful if youre checking through multiple accounts for the specificnewest alert in addition now theres no notification in the app to tell you theres an alert  theres only the notification on the main screen of the phone  otherwise keep up the good work i look forward to the improvements youll be making next,1i use this app constantly its undoubtedly helpful although its not without errors if i could change something i would add a full view for each transaction on iphone iphone  at least seeing as thats what i have i only get a  word partial explanation for transactions even when i use my ipad  i dont get to see full transaction description there should be a way that when you are looking at recent transactions that you can tap up each and bring up a separate pageinfo pane that more fully describes the transaction other than that this app is a musthave if you have a chase account,1well ive been using this app when it first came out and everything seems to keep getting better and better on every major update i like using it makes my banking experience better that i dont always have to keep going to the bank on a daily bases on paydays i see it as soon as the money goes into my accounteasy use and easy to understand quick pay is one of the best thing also i can send and receive money fast the finger print scan has more security which is good i like that i keep a check on my account every day and this app makes things easy with banking love it,1very happy they added the fingerprint id for logging in makes it so much easier and faster to log in to review information app has worked flawlessly and is fairly simple to navigate i use the notifications allot the only thing i would add is a shortcut to the notifications on the primary screens and have all unread notifications from all accounts appear on a single new alerts page once you view them they would only appear in the individual account to which they belong other then these wishful thoughts the app is great and im satisfied with it and he performance,1ive been using this app since it first came out  love being able to deposit checks by my phone rather than having to go to the bank  all my account are right here  i can pay my cc bill transfer money to my savings see what checks have cleared  works like a charm  now i just need to figure out why im charged  a month for my checking account  never go to the bank and only use the atm machine once a month  i think the biggest issue is the deposit limit per month  month or at least that is my limit for mobile deposits not really sure why there needs to be a limit,1this is one of my most used and reliable apps im so happy my banker advised me to get it i have all my accounts at my fingertips and can quickly and easily view transactions i enjoy paying bills via this app with immediate proof of making payment being able to move monies into other peoples accounts via chasequick pay is easy and cost efficient it cost  i use to be a bank teller and this app gives me the same power to not only see and know exactly what is going on with my account in real time but also make immediate changes if you have an account with chase you need this app,1of all banks ive done business with wells fargo bank of america suntrust bbva compass and us bank jpmorgan chase online banking and mobile banking is great the only reason i gave it  stars is because chase doesnt accept ebills which is the banking standard these days i find it annoying that i cannot handle all my deposits bill pay and transfers from one single place now i receive an email from a utility company for example write down the due date amount due and then i have to log into chase mobile or online banking to schedule the payments also the new credit card advertising banner across the login screen on mobile banking app is really annoying overall good app but is in need of some tweaking,1the app does what it needs to such as providing account statements view your balance and add checks this app gets  because in the past if i found a check and was unsure if i already used it the app would be able to tell me before adding it in however it didnt do that last time and there was no warning or indication that a charge would be made on my account for adding a check i already deposited in it wasnt a large few but one that i was not happy to see i spent money after depositing the check but not enough to the point where it mattered that i added the check ex  check spent  with over  in my account prior to deposit just be wary of that wish there was a warning,1i enjoy online banking because it makes life easier every business has working hours however they all overlap so being able to conduct financial business while im at work makes life easier  chases mobile app does that for me and i can appreciate the few extra minutes during the day i dont have to worry about making it to the bank  i have used all the features such as check deposits direct deposits quick pay money transfers and online line bill pay  as long as online banking doesnt start charging for the services i love it,1you have a chase account  yes  this is the app that gives you a window into the soul of that account  want to know how much money you have  log in  want to transfer money from one chase account to another  log in  its  am youre partying and you go to the atm to pull more money for bad decisions  log in and check that you have that baddecision money to spend  dont have any money log in stare at the negative balance and cry  want to know why your wife left you  log in and look at your accounts and imagine what her new boyfriends accounts must look like  he does drive an  maserati  boom  youre logged in,1who asked you if you were a chase fan if you dont like banks use a shoe box they dont have staff to hate on and they dont have tech departments to complain about just so you can feel more tech suave than the developer  if you dont like jp morgan chase bank in particular then get another bank or shoe box better yet open your own bank if all you have to say is negative then be polite and rate it  or  and get on with your life  better yet dont use the app delete it from your devices and create your own system but then who would you bad mouth then as for me both this app and chase bank get  stars,1in general i love this app the vast majority of things i ever want to do with regards to my accounts i can do in the appso why  and not  stars maybe theres a way to get approved for this but its not obvious inapp check deposit has a limit  daily limit and a  monthly limit i rarely can use it for that reason id be willing to pay a small surcharge or percentage in order to do breach those limits i obviously prefer other methods of electronic payment  but when a client wants to write a check id rather just accept it without it meaning i have to go to the bank the ui could use a reboot if i could customize a set of my common options like billpay to appear as a main screen button nested menus are an antiquated web interface taking notes from netflix for instance remembering what youre most likely to be there for would be awesome the app frequently forgets that i have it set to use my fingerprint to log in maybe thats due to app updates or a broken preference but i seem to have to turn that back on repeatedly,1i have been banking with chase for many years having their app has help me tremendously with my personal and business banking it has made things from making deposits to money transfers and even paying bills simple app is easy to use especially since were on the go we dont have time to go spend min in line waiting to talk to a teller or even waiting for an atm to be available to make deposits it is by far one of the best banking apps i highly recommend to anyone who banks with chase to use it and give it a try you wont know how great it is until you try it out for your self,1basic banking features work adequately mobile check deposit has been improved but the notifications are still very annoying and not easy to control it tells you there are say  notifications but they are not all in one place you have to go into different areas of the app to access them new features like secure mail have been shoehorned in as an afterthought without even being complete you can read and reply to messages but theres no way to delete them or compose a new one many of the features are hidden behind the menu essential features are hidden amongst the poorly implemented and inferior services that chase wants to push you into using,1one time i exceeded the number of login attempts i have fixed the problem and reset my password now every time i login to the app it tells me i have the wrong password and after only two times it says i have exceeded the number of login attempts and i get locked out of my account both on the app and online banking i called to discuss with support they reset my pass and i logged in on my desktop just fine i got off the phone with them and tried to login using the app it happened again they told me it was likely bc the first letter was capitalized i am  sure that is not the case i have since delete the app maybe i just found a glitch but it has happened multiple times and isnt because i am improperly typing in not happy with the app for that reason,0i cant tell you how many times i have tried to deposit checks through my phone and wasted precious time with no result   there are so many things wrong with this app   most of it relates to the idiotic check deposit system which doesnt save any photos if there is an error so you have to go through the whole process  which also has a limit to the amount on a check you can deposit   and good luck if you can get  of your checks to actually go through the system and get submitted then you can only cross your fingers and hope they show up  in general i like chase but this app is not high quality which is ironic because so much of their advertising is based around this feature  youd think they would have done it right,0i use this app to check my cc balance and to make the payments it is easy and takes less than a min to do plus with this app you can set alerts for various things that will help you maintain a close watch on expenditures if your card is used in a way you dont want it to be you can control all that from the app great if your kids have one for emergencies if your daughter has unprotected sex and used the card to buy plan b at your local drugstore you will know the instance she does if shes dumb enough to use the card in the first place for that then dont try and stop her we dont need more offspring like that but thats none of my business,1this is a clean simple app unless you have more than one account and sign up for alerts  when you receive an alert you cant tell which account its for which means opening up each account tab to see lthello is it you no ok close that account open the nextgt tedious also the account list changes periodically one month your checking account may be listed first next month its your savings then the next it might be your kids account it doesnt let you organize your account list in a way that works for you transfers between accounts are easy though and the check deposit feature is excellent,1so far this app works wonders for me except for check deposits but in their defense i only tried to do that once and it wouldnt let me to fill out the information that it was asking me to anyhow i still use this app at least  times a week very convenient and user friendly for the person that comment badly cause of their updates well that is what happened with most apps they might not work properly or at all if you dont do the updates i guess is just logical now if they can fixguide better how to set up the check deposit feature for the first time would be awesome too ,1someone titled their review dependable amp convenient  i just cant agree more  this app does absolutely everything an average person might need  check balances pay bills send money deposit checks transfer funds  its just perfect  my wife and i are on top of three chase checking accounts two chase savings accounts and three chase credit cards  as well as nearly all of our nonchase billsthe app is up most of the time and anytime its going to be down for maintenance you get a clear headsupall in all  its one of my most dependable and most frequently used ios apps,1ive banked with chase for almost three years however almost the entire time ive just been contemplating switching banks this app for me was the final straw banking apps should make it easier to keep track of your funds and to see how much money truly is in your account at any given time that being said according to this app my balance is almost never the same daytoday even when i dont touch my card at all this app has also been the hub of the frequent unnecessary and unexplained random fees on my account im not sure which is to blame more chase or their app but in the time ive had this app ive never really known how much money was or wasnt in my account ive officially begun the process of switching banks this afternoon and am hoping i find a better experience elsewhere,0the top level features check balance pay credit card find atm etc work reasonably well however get one level deeper and youre in for an adventure in a bad waytoday i had the misfortune of needing to use the secure message center which was the worst ux experience ive ever encountered on a modern customer facing app i could not use my add on keyboard so the message took me x as long to type upon trying to submit my message it errored out saying that my request could not be submitted and to try again later unlikly ill actually do that what a lack of user empathy even in the error messagethe small send button is at the top of the message immediately next to the logoff button so unfortunately i inadvertently logged off after crafting my message and had to type it againive had similar poor experiences with other features such as alerts their unability to be dismissed and contact us which only provides a phone number no chat or message optioni guess im in the market for a new bank now one that understand and invests in a decent user experience for its clients,0lower your expectations about everything available in the automated world and you will learn to appreciate it  years ago i had to be at a bank or an atm to deposit a check or transfer money now i can do all that and more within a few taps of my index finger yes there will be glitches but over time theyve become fewer and farther in between nothing is perfect and like any working system it will require maintenance and updating that being said i love this app and everything it stands for because it has saved me money and time with fewer trips to my financial institution well done chase,1this app is tied to a superior bank that really has invested in technology to improve services for their customer experience i have all the features of an internet bank with all the security and services of an old established financial institution i dont have to go to a branch unless i want to visit and get a cup of coffee this app handles all my needs if i need cash i can get that from any grocery store or major retailer as cash back i can deposit checks check balances move money between account and of course pay bills  all from my smart phone and all hours a day  days a week  days a year,1so ive had chase for about  years now and its been great the mobile banking app is easy to navigate and if im at work and its payday i can easily endorse my check take  quick pics and have it in my account the next day only just now im having a problem with the electronic deposit i take  crystal clear photos and it says that the photos are unclear and deletes them ive called customer it support and they tell me to uninstall and reinstall the app after turning my iphone off ive done that several times and it still isnt workingthats my only complaint,1having the ability to deposit a check when you get it is probably one of the coolest features of any banking app there are many times when i really dont want to make an extra trip to the bank to deposit a small check and this app gives me that freedom even though it may bug out at times the rate of success and the convenience factor far outweigh any of its quirks my only wish were that the find atmbranch function gave you a map instead of a list sometimes you need to see where it is spatially to plan out your driving trip if you do need to visit a branch,1ive gotta say that i have really enjoyed using this app in the past but lately its been barely useable because of the keyboard issue this seems to happen in all areas but is especially frustrating when trying to perform a transfer if the keyboard is up and you are in the check deposit area you can get around the issue by selecting the field where you take a photo of the front or back of the check this seems to force the keyboard down however if you are in the pay amp transfer area if the keyboard is up then the app becomes almost unusable since all of the controls are in the footer bar the only thing you can do at this point is logout and then log back in to try and perform another action also the save user id amp password havent be fixed for me ive got an iphone  running ,0there isnt much i can really say about this app i mean its not like it a super app or something its pretty accurate showing my balances deposits and withdrawals on both my savings and checking accts many times right after i make a purchase with my debit card like within a minute the app notifies of the purchase etc so far after dozen of times using the transfer money from acct to acct has been a problem i cant speak for the take a picture of a check bit tho for i havent had a need for that feature as of yet the debit rewards thing never updates and with every app update it suppose to fixed this bug but on my end  sorry it saids i have  points when in fact i have much more,1sometimes you are in a hurry and just need to quickly check your balance before doing somethingif you find yourself in that situation and open the chase app get ready to be annoyed  it makes you download the latest version before you can log into your account  and just when youre telling yourself ok this probably wont take too long it tells you that you have to update the os first  and that is no quick process  so if you were just intending to quickly check your balance and open this app you might want to just log in through the chase web site and save yourself some frustration  chase app developersunless its some vital security update you should not force updates,1i recently got a credit card from virgin americacomenity because thats the main airline i fly with its only then that i started to appreciate how many great options are available to me from chase that arent offered by everyone else this app works beautifully and seamlessly only rarely have i had an issue with check deposits but those work well most of the time too the notifications are a great way to track account activity now i can also see a picture of a check that was withdrawn from my account couldnt ask for anything more,1this is literally my favorite app the design of the app is clean and simple it has just the right amount of features for day to day personal banking and each feature is executed in an incredibly intuitive and effective way i absolutely love the fingerprint login and quick pay feature  makes checking my bills and paying bills easy  not to mention the splash of delight from the dynamic background picture and greeting on the login page a job well done  super impressed with the product team that built this i have much more respect for chase as a bank because of this app,1so i dont ever write reviews for apps so that goes to show how strongly i feel about this app ive had td bank valley nationals and bank of america and chases app puts every single one of these banks to shame ive gone as far as switching credit cards and such bc of how easy and simple it is to manage all my accounts and money thru this app with the chase pay and high mobile deposit limits i havent stepped foot in a bank for almost a whole year this app is par none and miles ahead for any bank i dont even know what else to say you either have a chase account or you dont lol,1this app is so convenient i have used several of its features and i like what i am able to do i use it to transfer money a lot my husband and my teenage daughter have accounts there also and i have them all linked together so it makes it convenient when my daughter need money i can just transfer it to her account if i dont have cash i recently made a deposit from my phone that was really neat the only problem i have with this app is that when i get an alert for one of the accounts when i go to the alert settings it doesnt tell me which account the alert was for the alert should take you to the acct the alert is for,1i have experienced many banks since moving to new jersey in  and none have met my needs nor surpassed them like chase has moving to chase was based on recommendations and  i wont lie  the monetary reward for opening the account who passes up free money i thought i can always switch if i dont like its services im still here and loving it quickpay is easy and now deposits the money without the recipient signing in do i wish this were available across other banks yes but i can use another app for that its not a good enough reason to leave chase would i recommend this bank i have and will continue to do so sountil you royally disappoint me chase + i  happiness,1the app is overall great there are still a few missing features minor annoyances but overall its a great banking appmissing features if you open the app and a different popup appears before the touchid popup like one to review the app then you have no way to trigger touchid besides going out of the app and back into it thats annoying put a button on screen like many of the other banking apps to trigger touchid when the popup does not appear or when you press cancel on accident why can i reply to a secure message but im unable to create one that seems to be a needless restriction to force me onto the desktop version of the site and the fact that i can access the desktop version through safari on my phonethat makes it doubly annoying that i cant do this task from the app please fix thatother than that im enjoying the app good overallmy only other recommendation would be to make the ultimate rewards site into an app as well it would be nice to not need to get onto the website at all,1great app easy to use  one minor problem  when you take a picture of the front of a check for deposit it does not automatically go to the back part of the check you have to push an additional button  since this has to be done anyway it would make more sense to have it automatically prepare to take the picture of the back of the check  this is by no means a major problem nor is it worth giving a four star rating just something i noticed that bugs me other bank apps i already have offered this feature automatically,1i never write reviews either but find myself compelled to tell my side this is absolutely the best banking app the notification are real time the history goes back a ways its all good its super easy to use  the navigation is simple and clear the touch login is truly my favorite option it seems to work perfect for my iphone  i find other mobile banking apps a pain and  a waste of my time this app doesnt lock me out or malfunction so the other people reviewing the app must clearly be challenged or just they have bad juju because if i can use it without a problem anyone canthank you,1love the app but would love it better if when scheduling a payment that it would always tell you duplicate payment when you accidentally schedule the same payment again and if when you do you could delete the cancelled payment from the feed because its confusing if i have cancelled payments listed with scheduled payments i should be able to delete some of the listing items on my account feed to make it less confusing for some reason i cannot delete messages either which is weird this would be greatly appreciated if you could offer,1figuring out which account an alert is for is maddening when i get an app badge notifying me of an alert its never clear which account has the alert i go to the side bar under connect with chase and tap on alerts but instead of this taking me directly to the account with the alert it defaults to the first of my accounts in my case checking then its a guessing game to figure out which of my three credit cards or my mortgage accounts or my savings account the alert is actually forthere has to be a way for that alert tap to open up the account with the frigging alert and not have me tapping every single account to figure out which is the one not to mention that even when i go tapping through theres still no definitive way to tell i end up deducing that it has to be the alert that has the latest date attached to it this is not user friendly at all ive tweeted this problem to chase twice and was told theyd get the tech engineers on it that was several months ago,1i loved this app until i selected the update thinking it would be an even better app since the update the little read dot with the number would not go away even after i read the alert i turned off all my notifications hoping the dot would go away but no success also when i logged out and attempted to log back in a few times yesterday it took several minutes than usual to load my account info it kept saying loading even after several hours this last time just this morning i deleted the app but will add it again later after forums app update a while back it was just as good as chases i want the old chase app back or maybe fix whatever is wrong in the update,1not sure what is going on with other people but this worked fine for me im on an iphone s with sprintwifi and ios  i was able to make a deposit immediately after updating i did shut down the app before updating and i had hardrebooted my iphone a few hours before  upgrade was smooth i would give  stars if it would save your password and prompt for it only during highrisk transactions per ffiec guidance i also do not appreciate chase requiring an update to a new version immediately after release  they should wait to make sure very few people are having trouble before the app refuses to run without an upgrade,1as the title suggests i manage several different accounts on a regular basis including my own business accounts im always checking at least one account everyday and transferring  back and forth between personal kids moms amp business to be able to do all that from one screen listing all accounts is almost better than pbampj sandwiches a close second for sure   ill admit i was a bit concerned about using finger prints for access but was happy its only to view accounts and your password is still needed to xfer funds  all in all i love this app amp chase for making my life a lot easier,1the chase mobile banking app for iphone is a good stable app that is missing a few key features that prevent me from calling a great app i can see basics about my accounts and move money around easily whats good quickpay is great transfer is simple bill pay is effortlesswhats missing cant use iphone fingerprint technology to log in my other banking apps from citi and td ameritrade do passwords dont allow special characters which makes my chase account less secure than it should be this is not unique to the mobile app but chase online too  cant sort transactions based on amount payees type etc  cant search for transactions based on payee starts with or includes amount range date range type or a combination of search criteria   cant see which account has an alert  have to open each account to find the alert  cant  easily classify transactions for later analysis and reporting with a quick dashboard view to see spending by category for a period or per period,1wish the statements on my phoneapp where more detailed i wish the charges would stay in order from when i make a charge to my card not according to the pending transactions just confuses me more which i dislike show dates on charges even if its still pending mostly just keep more order when it comes to my statements i hate when they jump around and not in the order they where charged if i swipe my card at ross i want it to stay in its place and not move around based on pending process leave it pending but keep it in order i like the app a lot i just think i my needs more order in that aspect stay in place and dont jump around dates times would b nice and more detailed,1overall great app i love how things update instantly and you can do just about everything from the app as you can logged in on your online account there is one improvement that i would love to see and that is in regards to pending transactions although it shows pending transactions and their amounts which is great i would like to see at a glance what the balance would be including the pending transactions ive seen other apps do this and it makes it a lot easier to quickly tell how much the balance truly is and not have to add up the pending transactions to the current balance if that one improvement is made that would be awesome,1the highly touted quick deposit function used to be hampered by low chaseimposed limits i have a business account with chase and sometimes find myself miles from a chase branch depositing checks with the app is a useful tool and you can now deposit up to k a day and kmonth a big improvement for biz owners other functions like looking up a balance or viewing past transactions are more useful although you cant view check images as you can online you also dont get any details on transactions  just the payee date transaction number and amount help is more extensive in the inapp faq than online their phone support is quick and somewhat knowlegable about the appyou can view past statements pay bills transfer money or even move money between unrelated chase accounts with quickpay this app has been made consistently better over time and now provides most useful functions for the mobile user without going to the website,1i agree with other reviews re correct updateslast night i made two transactions of  each for school items for my daughter i received only one push notification for one of the transactions showing the subtracted  and my remaining updated balancethe next morning i received my daily push notification showing my account balance and it showed my balance amount prior to the two  transactionsso yes the push notifications need to be up to date otherwise you may think you have more money in your account than you truly do very misleading with a strong potential to overdraw your account,1this chase bank app works great and does most of what i need for mobile banking the push alerts are instantaneous with a transaction but the way the app brings you the alerts needs work currently the push alerts go to an unspecified defaults account not to the alert that you see in notifications and select  other mobile banking apps such as a bank of america enable the push alerts to be in one list regardless of the account they are connected to the bank of america app then gives you the ability to touch any alert and be brought to that transaction in that specific account if chase to fix and update this push alert feature then this app would be a  out of ,1for the most part it does what a banking app does once im logged in and using the app but when the app routinely makes you go through the reset password procedure every few days because of a bug chase cant seem to fix which is a big hassle you really start to lose any desire to use the app let alone stay with chase as a customer  the convenience of using a banking app this day and age is very important i have several banking apps and they are rock solid in allowing me to log in using touchid or with a password chases banking app is rock solid in one aspect and that is the frequency of the log in errorbug the issue here is with the weekly problem that occurs while logging in normally i will unlock using touch id it was working pretty well when it was first implemented but lately without fail touch id will not allow me to log in just after one failed attempt with touch id  i will enter my correct password and it will come with a pop up stating i made too many attempts to sign in and i will have to reset my password this weekly reset is a hassle to say the least i know im not doing anything wrong it has to be a bug with the app or with chases servers,0the refresh is amazing the design is sleek and super userfriendly i dont have any problem at all accomplishing what i need to no matter where i am because its so easy to use i find myself using it all the time so i always know where i stand financially and its really very pretty one request  i use the chase credit journey service as well sometimes its in the inapp message at the top but usually not please please tell me its on the roadmap to build in app or at least link to it right now i have to leave the app to get to it and log in separately would love to have it all in one place,1overall this app has some nice features and is very useful in managing your accounts at chase  however it is far from perfect  the app tends to crash a lot and it has very poor button placement  eg when you are trying to manage your alerts the directional arrow buttons right above menu buttons that take you out of managing your alerts  this is very frustrating  also the option to select another account is right underneath the logout option  i cant tell you how many times i tried selecting a different account to only be logged off very frustrating  one the positive end very easy to make remote deposits and schedule bill payments  however you cant do multiple items at the same time,0this app puts all of my chase accounts in one place  at a glance i can see my checking savings credit card and mortgage account activity  i can transfer funds or pay bills  i no longer live near a chase branch so the check deposit feature is especially necessary for me  this app is very user  friendly   compared to another banks app that i also use chases wins hands down  the new style looks slightly different but the functionality is all the same  like other reviewers im not as comfortable with the looks of it yet but thats all that seems to have changed,1i use this app for  of all of my banking needs  my partner and i are on each others accounts and we can transfer money easily  most of my family banks with chase and we can send each other money within moments  transfers transfer almost immediately  the couple times i had questionsissues customer service has allllways be really great  the only problem was one time a transfer didnt go through quickly enough i called customer service and they instructed me to simply log out of the app and then everything worked fine,1this app is easy to use intuitive and has made my personal banking experience a pleasure i highly recommend this app if you bank with chase i dont know why others on here complain about the new look and design i like it i think its a great improvement over the older versions in fact i wish other apps had a similar look and feel there is only one small issue with this app and others have also mentioned it and that is the alerts it is hard to determine what the alert is or which account it is referring to only that there is an alert of some kind if they could fix or refine that this app would be perfect,1this app works great and there are a lot of features to manage your bank account my only issue is that every time you open the app it pops up to have you log in using your thumb print with iphone s and above this wouldnt be an issue but the only thing you do by logging in with your thumb print is basically look at your balances if you want to transfer money or do anything else it makes you type in your password i feel like thats a needless extra step the thumb print should be enough if they think its not enough for some reason they should give you the option to turn that off so it doesnt pop up every time,1i love chases banking app you can see the balances and transaction history on all your accounts and credit cards transferring money depositing checks and paying your credit card are all so easy the layout is also really pretty and highly functional finding what you need is intuitive ive very rarely had problems with this app when i have encountered a problem all ive had to do was close the app and reopen it sometimes chase does scheduled maintenance of their server but the maintenance is always done between like  and  am and they always alert you in advance yay chase d,1i have an auto loan through chase and since i took it out i pay monthly on my balance sometimes ill pay two to three times the balance to pay down principal more quickly but when you do so chase does not provide the next due date it simply says na which is confusing also no alerts as to when bill is coming due neither via app or email and i selected a paperless bill so room for improvement in active notifications and due dates even if i paid three months in advance i would still like to know the next due date even if the amount owed is  just my thoughts it asked i replied,1chase is my bank for life they helped me map my financial goals and being self employed i can really appreciate their solid advice the app puts me in control of all of my accounts on the fly and has proven to be an incredible tool for having control of my banking even when traveling or after banking hours couldnt be happier with the level of customer service offered by chase bank every time i get impressed by how much chase bank cares it reminds me after over  years with them wells fargo still did not care chase is the bank for me and the app is fast and accurate,1this app is the only reason i bank and have credit cards through chase  online bill paying is so easy once you set up all your accounts  it eliminates the need to balance a checkbook because as soon as you pay a bill the money comes right out of your account  or if you want to schedule it to come out later like after pay day you can do that and the funds will just come right out of there and pay the bill that day  logging on with my fingerprint on my iphone is awesome tooi can just check my balance with a swipe of my finger  love this app,1the chase app is easy to use extremely versatile and very well designed  i especially like the fact that we can set up multiple types of alerts on each account so that no one can sneak something through any of our accounts without our knowledge  the ability to open the app with the fingerprint on the i phone is very appealing  the only minor complaint we have is that if you try to pay your chase credit card using this app it appears to us that you have a choice of paying the minimum payment or the full balance but not the statement balance,1i would have no idea what my finances were like without this app i can check my bank account as often as i want it refreshes extremely quickly depositing checks with the pictures has been a absolute life saver i had no idea chase had an app until i opened my account and the ladies at the bank helped me set it up now this app is pretty much how i do banking also chase has been amazing with calling and texting me about fraud and refunding me money not super apprelated but definitely deserving of a star mention love how easy and reliable this app is thanks chase,1i travel frequently and sometimes for weeks at at time for work and sometimes approach my credit limits on business and personal cards while on the road the app in invaluable to stay on top of credit card payments and avoid those embarrassing moments when i do hit the limit when checking into a hotel it takes two minutes to make a payment and clear the balance while standing at the registration desk or paying a restaurant bill it also makes it easy to make payments for those bills that dont have automatic payment options,1use this app all the time  love the new touch id access  but i have one big complaint with how the app has been configured  used to be that i could look up all my scheduled payments on a single page  then they separated out the chase credit cards and line of credit accounts so that now i have to look at each chase account individually to view scheduled payments instead of having them integrated into the rest of the scheduled payments  it is a big nuisance now to go back and forth instead of having it all listed on a single page  please go back to the way it was before  much more sensible and user friendly,1this app just a gets better transfer money wire money see balance quickly and now touch id   you gotta love it  adding paperless is nifty id like to see the ability to freeze the account if my purse is stolen chase seems to be making all the right moves so ill wait to see what they come up with next or thing i would like to see is a printable note sheet for each month where i could summarize payments for each account for the year this would save me time so i wont have to scroll down to find out my payment history for a year  again very clean and convenient app,1chase finally delivered the touch id compatible mobile app perhaps the last of the major banking institutions to do so one step closer to being a complete mobile banking solution aaaaannnnnddddd it doesnt work i kept getting locked out of my account when i phoned chase they explained that touch id was causing the issue and advised me to disable itupdate as of  december  the app has not gotten any better ive gone backwards in time and i login by manually typing the password the app still locks me out due to the asinine security feature that chase has employed the app handles the security authentication so you never receive login errors until it locks out your account this requires you  to input sensitive account information to login and change your password,0ive been banking with chase since i was  years old  years later i am still a fan if that even makes sense i love chase and the app was just an added bonus to an already great bank this app makes everything soooooo easy and simple and when dealing with money that is all that any one wantssimplicityquickpay is the best feature too i be like yo let me borrow  stacks b and boom b sends me  stacks and vice versa my homie be like yo a let me hold fivehunnit son i dont even have to respond to the request i just hit the chase app quickpay  and my homie gets a notification that he received the money thank you chase,1i dont use too many different bank apps so all i can say is it works for me the event change disoriented me a little but now i think it has a cool look and actually i like it better because i can see both credit card and bank balance on same pagebigger and i like the more immediate access to bank transactions its three bar menu on the upper left corner leafy side works similar to other apps i use so thats easy to figure out i can easily find all the bank functions i normally use and can see the others i dont in case someday i do use them great little appi love it,1im impressed have used the app for about  years now each update has made it more useful once i learn how to use it accounts duependingpaid status is clear at a glance automatic transactions are easy to set up and change loans and credit cards are clear and current keep up the good  additions and upgrades ive tried to make sense of the negative reviews but came to the conclusion that the common themes seem to be an unwillingness to learn what the app really does and doesnt do to learn how to use it and blaming the app for the cellphones limitations,1is the reason you write so few reviews your lack of experience with banking ive had checking accounts since before the internet like when banks closed their doors at pm to start shuffling paper through the fed as in longer than youve been alive and i must say the chase app works quite well i have both checking and credit cards deposit checks via pics pay credit card via iphone etc etc etc maybe you should chill on the social media and gain a little more real life experience before venturing out into the nasty world of critical reviews just saying ,1chase was doing so good there for a while with the latest version that isnt the case theyve done away with text notifications and have gone to apple notifications the first problem is theres absolutely no sound option i want to know as soon as a charge has taken place against one of my accounts the second problem is the app doesnt indicate which account the notification came from once you realize that you have a notification some hours later you have to select each account separately one at a time to see which one has a new notification with  different accounts this can be quite aggravatingplease   is it really that difficult to add a sound option in notifications or highlight the account or somehow indicate which account has the notification,0this update app was made for me i work at home and do freelance and receive at least  weeks a month so often i made frequent trips to the bank and with this update it cuts literally all my trips thank you i tried the deposit feature and it worked great however i wont say its perfect it did crash on me and  of the checks the app couldnt read the routing numbers but it allowed me to input the numbers in manually which makes me believe chase put a lot of thought into the possible issues overall chase leapfrogged all the other big banks,1the chase quick deposit feature may be renamed not so quick deposit as it is extremely frustrating to use and is a consistent exercise in futility amounting to an exorbitant waste of timei have to make several attempts between  to do a purportedly quick deposit specially with a bank of america check most attempts are unsuccessful after going through the steps of  picking an account to deposit to  entering amount of deposit  properly photographing front of check  properly photographing back of check  and manually correcting any mistake regarding routingaccount number the app flashes a box that either saystheres an error with this deposit please click ok to try again if the error continues you may need to deposit the check at a chase branch or atmorwere sorry we are not receiving your deposit information you may wish to make your deposit at a chase branch or atmthis has been a perennial problem ever since the app was introduced in the market i have patiently put up with the apps misgivings hoping a company like chase will fix it in no time i was wrong there has been no improvement on this issue despite app upgrades im crestfallen,0i initially switched to chase because their atms gave you pictures of the checks you deposit which was important to me as a sole proprietor to keep track of client payments then i discovered this app and am even more happy with chase i can deposit my smaller checks right from home using the app  simply taking photo with smartphone great solution for my small biz also love being able to transfer money between accounts even when on business trips finally  love touch id so i dont have to constantly type in password great app one of the ones i use most,1generally i wouldnt write a review of the banking app because theyre pretty straightforward the chase app has all the features you would expect and is really convenient especially with the integration of touch id however now that i can sign into the app with touch id when i want to do something like transfer funds to a different accounts i have to enter in my app password this totally defeats the purpose of signing in with your fingerprint in the first place i realize there may be some sort of legal or regulatory reason why this has to be but it would be much better if once youre in the app you could simply use it freely,1other than i despise chase because they rip you off in fees and overdraft charges even when you have overdraft protection yeah right the app is okay except i cant access all my accounts  the account is in my name yet because a cosigner on the account set up a savings account that is linked to the checking i cant access that account to add money or set up direct deposits to it from the checking account  how stupid is that   well the cosigner on the account now uses the accounts and i am going to take my name off since i switched to a terrific credit union  my roommate who uses the chase accounts can have the whole thing roomy is getting ready to switch to a credit union and get the heck out of chase your money,1overall very good credit card banking app  allows fingerprint login on iphone  which is great and handy  easy to check balance latest transactions and make payments which is all one really needs in these types of apps  still requires password though to make payment  this seems a little odd given that banks usually dont care who is making payments only that payments are being made  am sure that this for added security at some level so not terribly concerned and dropping in the password is not that difficult  i have several other bank apps and this was one stays with the ones i consider the best,1this app is one star because it wouldnt even let me create a password to use the thing after i spent  hours making the first cryptic password last month which i forgot in the meanwhile  there are a few rules to follow when making your password according to the instructions but apparently there are also vague and hidden rules which make it a game of read the developers mind when it comes to making your own personal and supposedly private password  the whole thing reminds me of shenanigans in security theatre that dont help protect you and can actually harm you due to corporate incompetenceso after forgetting the password i spent  hours making last month i spent another hour trying again this month to drop the barrier between my frontal lobe across space to the minds of the chase bank developer company  seriously this makes me want to drop the bank more than anything but i know its not even the banking institutions faultthis was supposed to be a cathartic release into the bowels of apple reviews about the stupidity of security but it just became a gripe train about the front this app puts on when not letting you make a password to use the thing  one star because they deserve it,0i have had this app for many years and it has become a very convenient solution for my banking needs i like the added feature of transferring money to external accounts at no additional cost and being able to deposit checks from my phone with funds available the next day  i used to have to drive all over just to make deposits and move money between my bank and credit union now i can do everything through the chase app i am fully content with this app version if any other features or updates are released it would just be a plus for me,1former banker at wells fargo i never thought to look at an app before switching over banking this app needs a lot of updates  i miss bill pay reminders a lot connect bills with companies so that you know amount needed to pay without having to go to each individual site to get amount due setting up bill by date to be paid since i only pay bills after the first and th able to pay principle on mortgage on auto pay on different day of the month instead of with regular mortgage payment and show predicted amount in account with bills deducted on the date chosen right away not when it actually comes as i said needs slit improvement this app is very basic doesnt have any features other the the basics probably would have change banks so quickly if i would have known,0there is no chase bank where i moved to so i rely on depositing all my paychecks via the mobile app however at times the app wont deposit my check ive spent hours on the phone with customer deposit only for them to tell them my signature is not legible which is complete bs ive had the same signature for years and only until recently has the app decided not to deposit my checks ive been forced to open an account at a local bank just so i could cash my checks to have money to live everything else one this app is great but please fix the mobile deposit feature as some peoples financial life depend on it,1overall i love using this app to deposit checks transfer funds make payments etc that being said when i get a notification saying there is an alert for one of my accounts in the app i go into the app and there is a number next to alerts in the menu what i dont like is how when i go into alerts to check it it does not tell me which account has the alert i have to check each account and determine which account has the most recent alert if the app showed a number next to each account to signify how many alerts pertain to which accounts that would be a huge improvement,1ive been using this app for over a year and i find it works fine giving a lot of capability and convince i especially like the wireless check deposit feature which works well for most checks except personal handwritten checks an acceptable disfunction since we receive very few i like the ability to review the last years statements and even see copies of checks  it is so easy to use that i often use it instead of my computer   i would rather use it than go to the nearest branch which is less than a half mile from my home,1i like that i can see my balance i like that i can see my statements new and old  right away  i  like that if theres any charges that are made you get a email and u can look up charge you can look it up even if charges that are  six months old and u can look at statements without haven to wait  on hold and give all your info the card number date of birth mothers maiden name and your  security number best of all i dont have to talk to anyone  having social anxiety  that works out very well for me  i would like to see more of a description of what was purchased and full name of store  and can you please make a alert if your payment thats due changes especially if it changes to a higher amount,1i saw some bad reviews and a little shocked about what was said but i guess it boils down what you use the app for i can do everything i dont have to go inside a branch for basic transactions only the atm to withdraw cash of course i can track my balance in real time transactions appear instantly i can transfer money and even deposit checks using the app quickpay has been updated to where you dont have to accept the transfer via email i use the preview feature to view all my account balances without logging in just swipe right app works great for me no problems,1just what i need i can go in find my balance so i can pay it perfect the information is up front if i need to do a more detailed inquiry i can do that tooone tap from my balance due shows me all my transactions within the payment periodi had to replace the card once when i thought i lost my wallet replacing a lost or stolen card was not as up front on the app and not associates with my acct is this a good security feature in case someone had gotten a hold of my phone and my wallet probably it came down to calling customer service in the end and that person was very helpful,1ive been using the chase app since i bought my phone five years ago and it is rare that i have experienced technical issues aside from the occasional system maintenance on sundaysi continue to hold every other banks app to chases standard although if i had my way id be able to create a virtual card on my phone to get cash from anywhere just as though i were using an atm which is extremely helpful for trips overseasi would also like the ability to hide certain accounts on my phone the same way im able to do online,1typically i really like this app especially compared to other bank apps i use for work and personal accounts but this new update is insanely glitchy i cant get through more than  checks without having to close and reopen and log in to the app the windows gets confused and open up multiple times have the screen is thinking while the other half is fine on the third check it decides i need to retake the photos of the check but then it gives me a black screen that i cant get past and it randomly decides an error occurred while sending the deposit the only way to get past this is to restart the app i wish i didnt update the old version worked great,1this app is good ive never had any technical issues with this app however i do feel the app is not the easiest to navigate around also there are  or  things that you can do on the website but cannot do on this app if those issues can be done on the app i havent been able to figure it out i have been using this app for + years in all fairness i also feel like their website is not the easiest to navigate around either overall this app does the job makes life easier being able to bank on the go whenever i have to do anything major ie setting up or changing auto transfers setting up or changing payees i always go to the website on a desktop,1i use  password softwareapp to remember my safe passwords the chase mobile app will not allow me to use it directly i have to open  password app write down my password than open chase mobile app type in my password then i can deposit a check into my account fortunately this does not happen very often when it does it seems to me that it should not be this difficult if i use  password to log into my account i can but i can not take a picture of a check and have it deposited into my account i hope someday this issue will be solved,1chase is the best banking branch ive banked with so far im greatly pleased with the service ive never had to wait long for anything online over the phone or in person ive been treated with nothing but kindness and even personal interest expressed there was a perfect combination of customer service and genuine friendliness yes this is just to rate the app but i thought i would take a minute to express how i felt about chase in general as for the app i love it its very convenient allowing me easy access to my account and has nearly every feature one could think of available its fast and smooth,1im a small town boy from indiana who did a lot of his banking at a local small branch moving to a national bank was a big move for me and this mobile app is quite handy  when first downloading it the app would not properly name itself to my iphone and i would not be able to access it after deleting and waiting about a week to try again to download the app began to work being able to quick access your account from anywhere anytime is a great feeling i only rated it four stars because of the slight problem in the beginning other than that the app is very accessible user friendly and simple to understand,1dear chase mobile app as much as i love my credit card im seriously thinking about making a change i cannot get rid of or replace the background picture on my mobile app you see i have recently experienced a traumatic breakup and im tired of looking at the picture of the happy couple walking in the park you never know he could be cheating on her but nevertheless she walks beside him without a hint of knowing the doom that lies in the road ahead if there was a way i could get a city skyline or a pic of the beach without a wicked couple parading before me as i check the balance on my credit card that would be wonderful i believe i would be able to resume my life without bitter thoughts and feelings emerging after being visually assaulted on the reg i prefer a city skyline any city will do thank you signed misery in the mo,0definitely looks and feels like an app designed by a committee at a big bank no style and the elements that legitimately need to be used are drab and buggy touch id prompts regularly fail to appear if i go back into the app within a hour timeframe forcing me to ok the dialogue box that says my session has timed out exit or force quit the app then relaunch to get the touch id prompt this is on multiple devices after multiple restores and reinstalls secondly chase needs to have their engineers look at the simple app for an idea of the detail data and tools the modern something expects from a finance app if they were able to come close to simples feature set chase would get all my direct deposits instead of half,1ive been with chase for just over  years previously ive banked with wells rd and  or  credit unions i really like chase in every aspect i saw that some didnt like the message center i dont use that at alli open all messages to my email and so i have no problems navigating or utilizing the message centermy husband and myself have  adult children and we are using quick pay at least three times a week for one reason or another also we recently relocated and are an hour away from a chase bank so the online deposits were a necessity i have zero complaints,1love the convenience of the app the alerts and flexibility to set them to work for your specific needs is great however the notification centeralerts history center is quirky and needs some work  as mentioned by others between my wife and i we have multiple accounts  when viewing alerts the app does not show you which account the new alert is for when selecting view alerts from the dropdown menu it defaults the view to the alert history of an arbitrary account rather than an alert home screen that lists all accounts and indication of the account that has a new or unread alert,1this software has made bill pay and paperwork for my business and personal life painless and carefree  i used to spend hours of my day driving around and writing checks and calling around to pay my bills now i do it all here even deposit checks    with this i can accept payments from customers via email as well so they can pay me without even being in the same state and i dont have to leave my house    all said this is beyond valuable for me and i would never want to go back to the old ways of doing business,1i first signed up with chase manhattan bank  years ago as an intern in manhattan  the banker acted like he was doing me a favor and was arrogant  i left there seething  things at chase couldnt be more different now  customer service is off the charts great honorably discharged veterans get a great deal and chase keeps topping itself with ever improving technology  the mobile site is an example  what i most appreciate is the instant update of balances  other banks wait until midnight or longer to update balances but i always know my balance with chases app  so yes im a big fan of the app and of chase,1its simple and quick i like it sorry to say but if someone doesnt like this app they probably would rather go out of their way and just go into the bank itself that doesnt make any sense to me but then again what works well for me may not work as well for another person also i like that i can go online and see if any off the people i do business with allows me to check and see if they pulled the right amount of money from my checking account they tried to get over on me but i caught them and filed a dispute against the company other then that i love the app,1i love the chase bank app i use it everyday  or  times a day it helps me keep in touch with my business and notification alerts are awesome thank you chase for the ease and convenience of online banking no other bank compares to the number of functions that is offered by chase everyone i ask that doesnt use chase is impressed with how many options the chase bank app has it keeps your customers with you and i cant wait to see what new stuff you will bring to your customers in the future i recommend chase to everyone keep up the good work,1i was stoked when i was first able to deposit a check in no time the next time i wanted to use it for the same purpose i ran into all the annoying problems others mentioned first after logging in i was told i needed to download the latest version of the app to continue then it wouldnt deposit the check because connection to chase currently unavailable  this had nothing to do with my internet connection next attempt it seemed to want accountrouting numbers in addition to the check pics my own accountrouting numbers or those of the check issuing bank that wasnt quite clear but it didnt matter because it wouldnt let me input any numbers at allafter it worked so great the first time i am now reluctant to waste my time on it again,0 especially since touchid was added i always create a long convoluted complex passwords for my bank accounts amp it is impossible for me to remember them so i always had to use a password app to paste the password in no more i wait a second on the login and the tid comes up goldall the essential critical info is there and its easy to go to the safari website amp use desktop version on those rare occasions i need access to something i quite get to from the app  of the time whatever i needed is in the appnow if boa would take a lesson from chase on their app omg what a clumsy hamhanded app ,1update the app now crashes  of the time when trying to deposit a check they had previously gotten the check deposit working reasonably well after the initial snafu  original review if you are trying to deposit a check forget it this app loves to take you all the way through the process and then say that there is a problem no details what just try again  never mind that you now have an endorsed check in your hands  heres a thought get your program working properly or put a human at the other end to take  seconds to review the image  also the alerts are a total mess give me one click view of all my alerts and the account that they go to not button click hide and seek for each account trained monkeys could have done a better implementation,0everything works great for me the thumbprint option instead of retyping passwords for various features after you had already logged on with your password was a great improvement i especially like the ability to do the following  transfer money between accounts in seconds which is great since i have kids in college away from home  deposit checks without going to a branch and  create alerts that send me push messages about different things like balance below a certain amount or a transaction that exceeds a certain amount,1my local bank manager told me i would love this app and she was right  no more calling on the phone then putting in account number and waiting for  account info to be told to you and having to listen to all the listing to find what you want to do and then in the end you have to get a person to do it for you with this app the balances all show up at once your checks you have written can be seen  transfers between accounts are quick and easy it tells when your next auto pay will be paid its just very informative and easy to use,1ive loved every second of being with chase since my switch from wells fargo this app makes checking up on my accounts so much easier since i can have chase in the palm of my hand the push notifications are extremely helpful when im on the go and need to be informed of important activity on my account oh and the chase quickpay is expeditiously wonderful dont get me started on how i can use touch id to log in to the app to anyone that banks with chase it would be in your best interest to download this app nonetheless anyone who he yet to bank with chase what are you waiting for,1the touchid login never works every time i turn it on it prompts me to do it then tells me i need to log on to turn it on the most annoying thing with this app is that everysingletime i log in it says it doesnt recognize the device my iphone and prompts me to put in identification number i have to request this doesnt happen on just a few occasions it literally happens every time i log in so if im doing something on the mobile app i have to put in my long password plus the identification number several times this app is more trouble to use than its worth even if i try to save my phone as a device or have it save my information it still clears it out ive messed with every setting i can think of at this point i am just deleting the app because its that annoying,0i love having the chase banking app if only for convenience it would be great if the app had the same features as when you go online there have been several times where it wouldve been extremely helpful if the search feature was available but instead i had to wait till i could access my laptop the search feature is still not accessible on my iphone if i access chase via the web i just think if the chase app could match the chase web actions it would not only make this app + but it could possibly solve some current customer issues,1two issues here that have to do with bill pay i had a check fraud issue so my old account is no longer valid in bill pay every single payee still defaults to the old account i would view the new account and try to pay bills from there but every time it would default to the old account after that account was closed i couldnt pay the bills at all because the default account was  no longer valid  it directed me to go online seriously  there ought to be a way to set the default account from the app even online you have to set it individually for every payee  what a pain  and then its still buggy i paid the bills online from the right account and i still get the message this app is basically worthless to me now except for checking my balance,0the app allows me to look at statements which is great  because sometimes thats the only way i can find the info i need  like what the credit limit is when my due date is  would be more convenient to see that data without having to fish out a statement  and when i open the app on my ipad it does not work well at all  its formatted for a phone screen so it appears on my ipad sideways and only takes up  of my screen  my ipad is attached to my keyboard so i have to turn my head sideways and then zoom way in on this small portion of my screen to get the info  seems like one of the largest banks in the world could figure out how to create a more intuitive and user friendly app  but its better than nothing,0i really like the new look and great functionality of chases mobile app for iphone  i must admit when i opened it the first time amp noticed the different look immediately i thought great now i have to relearn a perfectly good easy to use app  but to my surprise its essentially the same as the previous version only better looking and seems quicker than the old version good job chase i would have given it  stars but there are two features id like to see added add a hotlink to whichever rewards program a visa card is earning add a chase email address as a choice for contacting chasebesides that great job chase,1i absolutely love having my accounts with jpmorgan chase and this app makes everything so convenient i travel a lot and there are branches almost everywhere the app is so convenient because i can do things like deposit checks with my camera when im on the go i also have the ability to monitor my checking credit card savings and investments all in one app its easy to transfer money between accounts and you can setup notifications for certain actions i love how easy this app makes my banking and i couldnt imagine going to any other bank,1this is a great app but its nothing more than any other banking app is doing nowadays  if chase wants to separate themselves from other financial institutions then they need to think customization  as a customer i want to be able to customize my account just like i customize my iphone  for example sometimes i have transactions that are named something i am not familiar with i want to have the ability to change and modify my accounts according to my desires i would like to be able to write in my checks so that ill get a better and more accurate balance and then when the checks clear it will replace what i had written in there,1its come a long way and is worthy of  stars now easy to use dont have to waste time driving to chase and waiting in line though chase lines arent so bad lately around here anyway still its a great time saver and is even doing a much better job now at accepting images of front and back where some years ago i would have it fail to the point of anger now flawless good job chase stay great and dont f up morally like wells fargo did and youll keep all your happy customers thanks for the convenience and thanks to the great developers who refined this app until it was flawless,1the app itself is well put together but seems to lack from my other banking apps in features  it took a useless phone call with high wait times to customer service who was of no help to figure out how to allow access to pay to my credit card from the app i cant change my pin inapp like my other banking apps or view  update my information  in fact i believe the only two things i can do inapp is look at my balances and make payments  i am referred online to do everything else and it needs to be done from a computer not a smartphone  in terms of simplicity its a star app but in terms of features and usefulness id give it  stars,1this app does exactly what i intend for it to do its so easy to manage transactions and i love the fact that once the card is swiped or something is charged it is nearly instantaneous which i love because i hate having delayed withdrawals to my account showing the previous balance before the last transaction is also perfect because it helps me keep up with what im spending and how much i have left this chase app has saved me from so many overdrafts pdf visual deposit slipscashed checks available through the app also come in handy  stars from me,1on a daily basis the app gives me immediate access to all the details with my accounts available amp pending the side features of bill pay quick pay and ask a banker make it so much easier to pay vendors bills amp investigate concerns updates are to improve the quality of the app when you install an update there can be errors that you can notify chase on and they will fix it  they cant catch everything and i dont expect them to the app works very well i prefer having a tight view of my finances and chase app does that for me,1i tried to enter a new recipient record for a recipient i accidentally deleted in the past  i attempted with their email address and also tried with phone number separately  i get a duplication error when i try to submit  the message states youve entered a duplicate mobile phone number  you cannot use the same mobile number for more than one recipient  please enter a different mobile phone number and try again or for email youve already added this recipients email address  please enter different contact information or change the existing record   the record doesnt exist in my profile,1i absolutely love this app honestly i love banking with chase anyway so having the app makes me love it even more its easy to deposit checks through the app and even transferring money is easy ive never had an issue with the app i love and also hate that when i try to sign on to the app through another device it wont allow me to it will send me a confirmation number through text or email i love that it protects you from fraud but it is also kind of annoying to have to jump through hoops other than that i give this app five stars i highly recommend it love it,1i feel like others whove reviewed this app it needs to have up to the minute acct balances helloooo i love the photo check deposit i like being able to transfer funds i also like getting a notice when my acct gets close to my uh oh point a limit you can set wa rep  your branch but after getting the notice then transferring  it still doesnt give you an up to the minute balance so i hate finding out the that im over drawn the next day when i thought i had more in my acct even after the transfer so i gave it a higher than fair rating which is better than i was going to rate it so it is a good app but it could be better thanks,1comparing the chase app to other banking apps this app lacks a lot of the details offered by others if you want to see anything more than the current at a glance status of your accounts you need to go in a view a pdf of the last statement while easy access to the statements is nice its not a very convenient or uselful way to view transaction history theres zero interactivity involved while useful for viewing current payment requirements for credit cards and mortages this app lacks any useful detail beyond the how much do i owe quick view its nothing more than an app version of the web page  actually the mobile web page is more useful so why use the app,1the new chase mobile banking app easily gets five stars i love being able to access all my accounts on one screen i can edeposit my checks and have them available for withdrawal the next day the pop money feature is awesome and the only thing i would ask to add in a future version is an instant realtime chase to chase customer transfer if i want to transfer money to my dad i should be able to just enter his account number state its a checking account select the amount and bam navy federal has it and its an excellent feature that aside great app,1i am not sure what happened in recent updates but it needs to be fixed every single time i try to log into the app i have to constantly reinput my log in info even if i have the remember me option checked and honestly that would not be an issue if the touch id worked properly i have to input my log in even tho i have the touch id setting which is always followed by having my account locked because of too many attempts every time ive gone though numerous passwords but heres the catch you cant even reset it though the app you have to log in on a computer and reset it that way then by the next time i try to access my account via the app its the same process all over again i hope chase fixes this soon cause im running out of passwords and patience,0the chase bank has great features that are easy to use bill pay is easyvto set up i have the option of setting the up automatic periodic payments or manually paying them each month it is easy to set up alerts i can set up an automatic email text andor push alert whenever i use my debit or credit card for more than a  purchase or other transaction  this is a great security feature many times i receive a text about a payment while i am still at the cash register before the register gets the approval,1before when i only had one account at a local bank it was always a pain to try to check how much was in my account since their app kept thinking i was a hacker and kept locking me out this chase app does everything i need it my only annoyance with it is with depositing checks via app it wont register it even though it is plainly written good thing i live close to a chase where if i receive a written check i can deposit it it doesnt happen as often with typed checks but it is still an annoyance since it used to do it quickly hopefully this new update will clear some of that up,1i love that i can do all of my banking in one place at one time makes everything convenient and quick to handle business i have not had the fingerprint issues others have complained of the only time fingerprinting has shut down has been when a major update occurs the last updates have made credit card monitoring easier chase does handle fraud issues better then other banks as well used my debit card at a gas station and within minutes i was getting charges as i drove chase called as i was hitting the next exit to call them and handled it immediately all in all a great user experience,1the app is ok its the best its not the worst however i was really excited about the idea of taking a picture of a check and depositing wow thats innovative since i go to the bank weekly to deposit checks for personal and business use this had the potential of saving me a ton of time but on my very first try i was told that i exceeded the daily limit that makes it completely useless why have a limit at all if its a check that is to me then i should be able to deposit it either let me take a picture or dont but dont give me some halfhearted effort i can still deposit my check in the bank or atm right then why cant i use the new picture tool,1great app super convenient i love all of chases features this app just gets better everytime i update it this bank is aweomeee such great customer service one thing i would like to see added on this app is the message feature because when the messages are sent to our secure box i am unable to check it until i get to a computer and i use that feature alot so it was frustrating hopefully they will read this and try and implement this next time other than that i dont think much people use the message feature but it would just be nice to have it so five stars,1unlike most of the other reviewers i am not having a problem logging on but i am operating on the s and it sounds like the login issue may only be with the new s this app has been good for getting online and checking account activity what stopped working for me was my favorite feature the mobile deposit about  out of  times it says that there was an error with the deposit and to try again it also says that if this error continues i may have to go to a branch or atm to deposit my check well that is inconvenient especially when im depending on being able to deposit a check right away and im not in a place where i have access to an atm or a bank chaseapple fix the mobile deposit  it was the best thing about this app,0sometimes simple goes a long way im very upset with this new update it makes me feel like an  year old with huge text on my screen the greetings are unnecessary and take up too much space i go through many transactions a day and with the new update i can only see two or three transactions at a time it makes no sense that the small details are in huge text while the important buttons are tiny to accommodate for the vast unused space no major functionality updates have occurred and the app only looks better without actually functioning better i still have to go through multiple tabs to make simple transactions or to get rid of a notification and there still is no passcode option very disappointing,0i was forced to update my app in order to use it the new login screen is pretty but thats the only thing thats improved the display is not as easy to read as it was before the grid format was simpler now the total amount in each account is displayed and directly underneath is the button to pay bills im always afraid when im scrolling that i might hit one by accident then the same old problem with the alerts the badge disappears as soon as you open that section even if you havent checked your alerts how does that help the number of alerts should show up as mini badges next to the account number and should count down as the alerts are checked,1update  i am happy to say that my favorite banking app now has touch id with flawless implementation works as expected this review has been updated from a star to a starout of all of the banking apps that i use this app is by far the most ui friendly and functions flawlessly for my uses however this app is missing  feature that causes it to lose  star which is touchid support the other bankingtheir competition eg discover american express support it and makes logging in a less tedious task why cant the app developers of this app implement it as well,1the app is always improving with features that fit the phone and the software at one point i would still have to go to the website go perform  or  tasks but now everything i need to do can be done from the app recently they have added fingerprint sign in something i thought about in my head but never mentioned as a suggestion makes logging in easy quick and secure i have a credit union app as well and while that app is very functional i still have to go to their website to manage certain things overall this is a great app,1this is a fantastic financial app i currently use  different banking apps for my accounts and this app leaves the others in the dust in fact i find myself using the phone app more that going on line from my computer i can basically do everything from here that i would if i was logged on from the computer i especially love the check deposit function with a recent update they have also incorporated the fingerprint scan security function soif you bank with chase  give this app a try you can do a lot from this mobile banking app while still feeling very secure,1easy to use easy to understand quick to deposit paper checks easy to schedule payments easy to pay bills i have no complaints ive only had a couple of issues with checks not being able to be scanned but in each case it seemed to be more an issue of the handwriting on it i do  of what i do from the app a couple of things i still need to do on the desktop versionstop payment search for specific checksbut everything else i do from my phonei cant remember the last time i actually had to go into the branch,1as others have pointed out the touch id access is great but having to enter the password to pay the bill seems pointless  please allow payments with touch id  also i would like to see account statements without having to enter the password  either chase trusts the touch id system or it doesnt  a halfway implementation is not a logical solution  also from a user interface standpoint having more options from the accounts screen would be more useful  as it stands one has to figure out that pressing the current balance line is how you get access to more information about the account  why not list the important options right up front,1ive been paying all my bills with chase online banking since  and with the chase app since  i couldnt guess how much time ive saved over the years not filling out bill forms writing out checks stuffing envelopes going to the post office to buy postage etc i buy one sheet of stamps a year since i switched to chase online banking and sometimes i dont even use all those i pay everyone of my bills for the month in less than a minute the chase app is usually one of the first apps i download when i upgrade phones,1i have used various online banking apps over the years for a non pure play online bank i am giving chase  star they are continue to invest in it and add functions so that you can do most banking from home i couldnt speak to the adequacy or their online banking security but i have gotten good warnings via text a couple of times when someone was hacking into my credit card account also the customer if chase has zaro responsibility shall your credit card is used unauthorizedly where some bank charge  i like chase online banking,1ive had an account with chase since  and i loved the mobile deposit feature it only seems to work when it wants to its extremely inconvenient bc i need for that feature to work since i travel frequently and am not always in close proximity to a branch or atm i contacted customer service and found no restrictions on my account but it just will not work im not sure whats going on but please fix it i would love to give this app  stars but this has been an ongoing problem now for a couple years and i keep having to call and bug customer service no one seems to know why it doesnt work,1i use this for my small biz and it saves me a ridiculous amt of time i deposit every single check using this app which takes literally less than  min per check i then get to keep the hard copy which is a bonus for my filing system also use quick pay frequently to send funds to my personal acct paying bills is also quick and easy and most of my vendors rec the payment by the next business day occasional glitch here and there but not enough to cause problems or negate any of the many conveniences the app has to offer,1this app saves my financial life i have a relationship with chase corporate and chase local even though the banking industry is so hard on small consumers i feel chase does a great job i do not like some of the new local branches though i think they need security more than  times i went to a local location camino real and federal in boca raton to get cash and i would not get out of my car because the homeless were hanging around that is very scary for a single woman but daytime banking is fine i work until  pm most nights but when i go at lunchtime during the day it is fine but boca raton should be safe,1i have cards from seems like every bank and the chase one is quite nice among them the quick check and finger login is nice and auto linked bank and freedom card so able see them both rely quick and manage accounts sending payments for me has worked fine and the ability check scan copies deposits has helped me few times only thing i havent liked is the picture deposit for checks it can take forever to process and i have even had one fail for no reason and i went just deposit it like normal,1i have been banking with chase and boa for years now i actually stopped using boa due to their previous app boa had a horrendous app and i needed something more mobile friendly i ran with chase and watched them develop a great mobile friendly app that eventually over time suited my needs boa however has caught up their mobile app allows you to use the apple thumbprint thingy to log into your account chase what are you waiting for i still have to log in by typing my password too analog for me as for the token ive tried it and still no quick log in ill give chase the fifth star rating when they give me a thumb print ability,1this app is nice simple and fast the one thing i would really appreciate in order for this app to be given  stars is to post transaction times i would like to know what exact recorded time i made a purchase or any sort of transaction not just the date some business transactions are very time sensitive nowadays and many times i really need to know the exact time in which i purchased something to keep myself organized add transaction times and i promise many other chase customers will also give this app  stars four stars for now but amazing app,1chase has paired down the steps but there is still an extra steps that are redundant if we click on taking a photo of the back of the check why do we need to verify taking the photos of the back of the check a second time silly and how many times must we answer yes deposit this check that ive just spent all this time taking photos of weird some of those steps should have been eliminated ages ago also sometimes the app doesnt recognize the number which to me seems clearly written in the number line and i have to take it into the bank but thats understandable i guess,1i was getting to admire bank of america for thier iphone banking app yet on a boring night i was browsing the apps store and i found this app i immeadiatly dowloaded it and signed in as for the new computer sign on verification i had no problem with signing on the thing that does not make this a great app is the inside look the listing of my accounts and the listing of my account transactions seem sloppy and not well structured the inside layout past the log in screen looks like i am reading a jumbled up notepad when i look at my account transactions it will list them off  at a time the app is nice to have yet as i said it needs to clean up from the inside,1the previous version of this app was junk  basically just a wrapper for a browser window to a notsogreat mobile web site i just pulled down the  update and its finally been written as a real iphone app nice interface for balance checks transaction history online bill pay and account to account transfer pretty much everything i do on chases full website plus you can call up atm locations and whatnot i only have checking and savings with chase so i cant speak to any features related to credit cards or other types of accounts,1i have the chase mobile iphone app for my apple iphone  gb amp yes i go to chase manhattan bank in new york i do have chase accounts in the chase banks amp since i have apple iphone  gb i have the chase mobile iphone app for it amp i had an apple iphone  gb for a year now amp the chase mobile iphone app was the st app when i st got my apple iphone  gb amp since then i been using the chase mobile iphone app for my apple iphone  gb everyday amp it never once gave me a problem ever amp this chase mobile iphone app works great amp i gave the chase mobile iphone app  stars from me ok well have a good day from your costumer byron koukaras ,1i really like this app but its so difficult to view an alert the app will show a badge with a number of alerts on your accounts when you open the app and sign in its fairly easy to get to the alerts tab when you click on alert history it defaults to one of your accounts which is probably not the correct account you then select a drop down for to select another account but you dont know which account had the alert so you have to select each one individually to see which had the most current alertthey could easily put a badge or dot on the account list to show which accounts had an active alerteven more useful would be to land on this list of accounts as soon as you selected alert history why in the world would chase decide to just show you any account by default is absurd it always defaults to my savings account alphabetical date account opened i have to toggle through  accounts to find the account with the alert very time consumingi hope someone reads this and fixes this alert experience a simple change could make it  better,0the function of depositing checks online in this app is very useful i have been using it in the past three yrs however with the new version on iphone  there is an issue with using camera to take the picture of the front and back of the checks the picture taken will be much wider than what you saw when the picture is being taken you can align your camera perfectly to include the check when taking the picture but the check will only be in the middle of the picture taken with large additional space around it this always makes the app say the picture is not clear please fix this issue,1ive been a chase customer for as long as i can remember but over the years theyve lagged their competitors in useful tools to help me manage my daytoday finances admittedly ive switched accounts over to others over the years and at the time found their bill pay and mobile experience to be betterwith this refresh of the mobile app and added features i feel chase made a big step forward and that gives me hope that i can potentially bring those accounts back and feel good about the tools i have to manage themnice work,1this app is okay i like the check deposit feature and how you can transfer funds right from your phone it saves a lot of trips to the bank my problem with this app is that is not accurate during the weekend most people do most of their shopping during the weekend and need a reliable bank account balance when i asked about this issue at the chase bank branch the personal banker explained to me that at chase they consider saturday sunday and monday one business day this means that any debit or credit card transaction may or may not show in your bank balance until tuesday morning this is a big glitch on the bank as a customer i feel that i should have access to my bank balance at all times every time,0it takes longer to deposit a check on this app than it would take me to walk a quarter mile to the local branch on the ipad its virtually impossible to get a clear pic and after the first rejected image what you see on screen is reconfigured sideways so you have to rely on your inner eye if you manage to get perfectly clear shots of the front and back as i did on the iphone youll get numerous error messages before you finally give up and walk over to the bank please fix this feature or do away with it altogether dont sell your customers that youve got a device that will make their lives easier when what youre offering is a broken tool,1this app does what it needs with some annoyances first of all depositing checks is far easier with the bofa app it takes the pic for you once you have it in the rectangle secondly and most annoying is having to put your password in to do every day things once you are already in the app if anything i should just have to use my fingerprint again the whole reason i have the fingerprint sensor is to not have to remember all my passwords so it is highly annoying when i log in and then cant do so simple transactions like even read notifications without entering my password if i wanted to keep using my password i wouldnt log in with the fingerprint it truly defeats the purpose,1this app is amazing and is a lifesaver in so many moments if i ever need to transfer money from savings to checking pay my credit card deposit checks or simply just check my current balances i can with this app everything i ever need to do with my accounts is practically available through this app i rate the app  stars for the simplicity it takes to use it the overall effectiveness of the app and the ability to combine all of your chase banking accounts including your credit cards very happy with the app and have recommended it to friends,1this app has the bells and whistles youd expect from a top bank like chase it could use a bit of a uiux overhaul as the navigation sometimes requires far more taps to do simple things but my primary issue with the app is that you can enable touch id for a convenient but still secure login but when you do the app continually asks for your password to do pretty much anything other than read your account balances  currently theres no way to disable this feature and allow only touch id as the means of full access to your accounts another example of a big corporate conglomerate taking our personal security out of our hands and into their own and we all know where thats left is in the past,0theres been several times that ive made a purchase that wasnt shipped right away so the funds reappear without warning and sometimes slip through the cracks no matter how diligent you are an option to enter checks with number and amounts and a confirmation or alert that a purchase amount is available would be great id rather enter a check so that it shows how much i really have rather than trying to go through every purchase to verify sometimes takes weeks for a check payment to be deposited by the other party this would greatly improve the app,1i have become incredibly annoyed with this app i am normally patient when it comes to lagging apps including all factors like poor reception wifi phone or app malfunction etc but it seems like every time i need to use the app it always gives me the same stupid message you cant use the app try again later ive already deleted and added the app updated and restarted my phone it gives me the same message constantly if im logging on to check my accounts it would be nice to check them promptly especially if im over drafted thats all there always seems to be a problem when i need to log on if you can fix it thatd be nice thank you,1i am a capital one cc customer trying to switch to chase cc your app will be a deal makerbreaker touch id is great but look at capital ones wallet app its quick no concept of logout and shows pending cc charges on st page your swipe to see balance is cool but would be better if it showed pending charges along with balance make it easy to validate cc charges just made with  clickswipe this will help with preventing cc fraudit fails to make a sound on apple alerts under ios notification settings chase app doesnt show sound as an option for notification which also impacts apple watch,1it is a cleaner look once you log in i would like to have the fishing look change with the seasons but that is just because i am not a big fisherman i have used all of the functions and they all respond quickly and efficiently i use the quick deposit often and it works perfectly each time i have paid bills and it was easy with no problems at all i check balances every day the quick pay and quick receive are a great feature that i use each month i like this app and use it daily,1the chase app successfully integrates all of my accounts into one easytouse interface i can access checking savings and my credit card with just a few swipes transfers are easy to carry out no matter where i am and security features like fingerprint identification and password checks ensure that my interactions always feel safe and protected i hardly have time to use all of the features the chase app provides but i know ill be able to find what i need in any situation this app demonstrates one of the key advantages of banking with a bank of chases scope and resources,1love my chase iphone app use it all the time to check balances move money and deposit checks easy to use and they are always making improvements chase has their act together here and this makes me a happy customer i also appreciate all of the security features that they keep adding to help protect me from fraud  text alerts for credit card transactions from unusual places or online orders required to reenter my pin at the atm for each transaction all are exceptional measures that dont require me to jump through a bunch of hoops keep it up chase,1this app used to be pretty good but now its more clumsy cumbersome and buggy for instance depositing checks  one of the main things i do with it its not as clean an interface anymore the picture taking doesnt work very well and it takes forever to determine the routing and account numbers i thought the app had froze it took so long i wish i could post pictures of the bugs which are primarily display oriented because they are hard to explain without seeing them after taking a picture of the check the confirmation screen is landscape but oriented as portrait on the phone so its cut off if i hit the home button and then go back into the chase app it refreshes and looks proper what a mess dont bother innovating where innovation is not needed chase you had a good thing,0the only use i had for this app was electronic check deposit i only see a handful of checks a year one monthly check and then checks from grandma on the kids bdays and for christmas the old version was mildly annoying in that it refused to accept checks where the writer had looped any letters below the memo or signature line but this new one will not accept a check that is similar to previous checks guess what i get two types of checks multiple times in the year they are all similar so now i have to go in to a bank because i followed the directions to write for electronic deposit only on the back which failed so now i need to interact with a teller to verify there is no fraud happening so the kids can have there college money deposited not impressed with the update,0the app has been pretty much user friendly there are a lot of unnecessary side menu options i never use that can seem overwhelming one thing i wish they would change is in regards to their credit card activity listing the app only shows your transaction amount and no balance adjustments per transaction so you can not follow your actual balance all you can see are the transactions and you final total example bank of americas credit card page shows your transactions its immediate affect to balance next to the transactions and on the top your current total,1i use the chase app all of the time it makes banking easy from checking my accounts to transferring money on the go to depositing live checks paying contractors and more my only quibble is when i put a note on what im paying for the recipient doesnt also receive the note so they dont know why they are receiving the payment that is the only thing that annoys me about quick pay to handling my banking on my computer its not just an app issueoverall the chase app is great its easy quick yet i get all of the information i need and make the transactions i need to make without logging into my computer,1i was at washington mutual chase took over that bank amp since then things have moved very quickly in the  century   i ca see they are not waiting to see what the next big thing is chase will bring it to us in quite stunning fashion im assured of the staff if knowledgeable amp very kind  ill be here for many years to come  although i wish they would compete with other banks for  amp  year cd rates i had go to synchrony bank with a huge sum that i could have used amp stayed with chase please chase offer your regular high cash holders competitive rates or i will venture out  richard,1every  or  times i use this app i have to reset my password i was using touch id to sign in and it worked fine and then i updated the app to the newest version with pictures in the background of the login screen instead of just the solid blue screen once i update i noticed every nd or rd time id go to use the app it would say too many login attempts please reset your password no nobody had my phone and was trying to unlock it so eventually i started hitting log out before i closed the app and the problem still persisted i eventually just turned off touch id login and opted to just type my password each time i still every rd time or so i go to use this app have to change my password and it is so inconvenient chase please fix this major bug i am on an iphone ,0use it only for my credit card i give it  stars because of its very easy to use and make payments it also is only getting for instead of  because i bank with ccu out of frankfort ky and their mobile app is tremendous by far the best banking app ive ever used very fluent and easy to see all my transaction this app is great but could improve on being a littler more fluent can be tricky trying to see your transactions and credit limit once you find the right button you see all the details you need let words though are once you find iti still highly recommend the app a very strong  stars,1ive never had a problem with chase and the app is super easy to use i love the quick pay feature makes it easy to transfer money without have to give another appderive my banking info everyone at my local chase is super nice too i had my info hacked into a few years ago and chase didnt put up a big fuss and got my money back it took a bit to go back into but thats something that usually takes time to fix just glad i dont have to fill out papers like my dad just did for another big banking company about getting hacked into,1when you get the notification for how much you have in your account after each day it doesnt reflect what you really have  for whatever reason they are showing you more than what you really have  might have to do with when transaction record but it can be misleading  this morning i am about  less that what the notification sent at around midnight and i havent purchased anything today yet  i really see this as a trick by chase to garner more overdraft fees so be careful  always check your account and dont rely on the notification to accurately portray what you have in your account  otherwise app is pretty good,1i love it because i can deposit a check by just taking a picture of it its amazing it didnt work only once but thats okay please add an expense tracker it would be so helpful to keep track of my spending by category since i use this account as my main account and then a bill reminder would top it off i would be able to do everything from your app and website simplify my life and save time is always my goal please please please i already tell friends about chase just lacking in this department then i will definitely change my rating to   and delete all my other apps to keep track of everything,1great app but the one thing keeping me from rating it  stars is the fact that you cant view the checks youve written i used to have boa and their app has a feature that allows you to click on a check that was deducted from your account and it shows you a pic of the check i travel all over for work and have to use checks quite a bit and its extremely nice to be able to go to the app and find a check that you wrote thats been deducted from your account and see all the details chase bank in general is better than boa but the boa mobile app is better than chase,1this app is great i was weary about the deposit feature but ive used it about  times now and its amazing my chase bank is inconveniently a few miles away and this app saves me that drive i feel like there is no difference in wait time if i had deposited via atm great job chase now if you would place a chase bank beside every boa that would be fantastic lolboa is everywhere even right across the street from where i live but i dont want to bank with them i guess this app serves its purposeunless i wanna withdraw cash  stars either way it works great,1i use this app all of the time for checking our account balances credit cards activity and making bill payments i do wish that when i see a payment i made by check that i could see who the check was made out to and not just the check number i also wish the alerts were more specific so i know exactly what bill payment etc the alert is about even with that being said i love the app and highly recommend it makes paying bills individuals and managing your accounts much easier very convenient,1one of the only reasons i downloaded the chase app was to use the check deposit function it used to work just fine more than fine actually check deposit even worked when i was abroad and needed to make a deposit but suddenly it just stopped working properly sometimes itll say my check image wasnt good enough sometimes itll say it cant scan the amount and sometimes everything will work until you get to the last step when itll tell you there was some sort of error not sure why its stopped working but i dont seem to be the only one with this problem so maybe one day chase will fix it,1i have to say that chase is probably one of the best banks out there and they have to app to prove it this app is amazing i have had absolutely no problems with it whatsoever they are very good with alerting me if some suspicious looking spending is going on with my account and we were able to fix it as soon as it happened its very self explanatory very user friendly i used to belong to wells fargo and i used to have their app as well and let me tell you the difference between chase and wells fargo is mind blowing thank you chase for being such an amazing bank and putting out an equally great app,1just the other day i saw that the  app has a new feature to view your acct info without logging in i thought funny ive been doing that on my chase app for months now the best type of app is the type that gets software updates and you dont notice chase has does a good job updating their app without me noticing it is by far the easiest to use as well the settings menu makes sense and the info i need is never more than three tapsswipes away the background colors could stand to have more contrast also it takes way too long for transactions to change from pending but over all ill probably never stop using this app cuz its more useful than not,1ive used this app thru several iterations and each is improved over the last the new interface is fast and easy to navigatefor the most part i havent had trouble with the app launching or crashing one thing that is a bit odd is scrolling down credit card entries by default only the ones from the current statement period are listed which could be a short list if beginning a new period you have to change the filter and search to see all transactions this makes quickly looking to see if a charge came through a little more difficult sometimes that said i find the app very useful a couple of times per month i deposit checks using the phone camera to scan them and i can quickly initiate a transfer from my savings to checking or pay a bill with billpay also in these days of identity theft i go to the app frequently to check for fraudulent charges,1app is performing well but the settings menu basically only includes paperless and account preview options i had to find out by myself how to set the app to accept touchid it was set to token and in that case the option to change to touchid does not even show in settings first the check mark has to be taken out for the token only then it will the app give you the option of touchid after login otherwise the app is performing well and does what it is supposed to do making payments checking balances depositing checks  all works fine without flaws or hangups,1the app itself is great touch id is a nightmare it will randomly turn off and make me enter my password which i do correctly but it keeps telling me its the wrong password andor there has been too many attempts when ive only tried once and i need to change it i have changed my password  or  times in an  month period due to this mess and is very frustrating since none of my other bank apps do this ive had to change my password twice within a week and a half once i am not happy it is such an inconvenience and doesnt make any sense ive called online support to see if they could see why this was happening and fix it but they didnt see any reason why it would turn off my touch id and make me change my password and couldnt give me an explanation or help,0ive been using the chase app since the beginning  it was good for the times back then and they have continuously updated it  i also use the apps for several other financial institutions and chase is the best  you easily can find most of the information you need for instance there are several other banks that give you the current balance on your card but not the credit limit  the only real complaint i have is one noted by several other reviewers  the alert management is rather clunky if you have more than  chase account with not identifying with which acct the alert applies,1june st is a watershed day for my chase mobile app  i can now sign into the app on my iphone + with just a fingerprint  i despised having to type in a password when i needed to access my account away from home especially since financial security almost mandates frequent password changes as well as different passwords for each bank or credit card account you have  i havent heard of any black hats having found a way to capture and duplicate fingerprints yet so in one stroke my chase card has become both more secure and easier to use bravo chase,1this app is so easy and convenient for all your banking needs i can deposit a check without having to make it to the bank before closing time i can transfer money from one account to the other even while in line at the grocery store  one time i realized i didnt have my one debit card so i transferred money to my other account in seconds i also love the quick and easy touch id so you can access your account faster without having to type in your password chase has made things so convenient for their customers,1i paid off my chase account last month only to find out that this month i was charged with an interest rate i understand this is normal practice for credit card companies  but the other credit card companies discover card capital one and citi all were kind and professional and took this interestrate off my accounts chase credit card is the only one that feels they need to keep on sucking more money out of you  i understand all companies need to make money but customer service and professionalism should stand for something  i will be closing out this account and saying goodbye to my chase credit card and encouraging all my family members and friends not to use this company especially when you can use discover card capital one and or citi bank instead,0when i called csr they said lots of people had my same complaint bug they did nothingeven on the latest upgrade on the previous forced upgrade it hides important info you have to jump through so many senseless hoops to find your records why did they complicate and ruin this app whereas you used to be able to see pending ccd transactions as well as posted ccd transactions you no longer can ok you can wait  days check again and possibly see the very most recent transactions but then you cannot see any history as you were previously able to do now you have to play games and click various extra steps then memorize what you saw to compare it to what you can see i think they are hoping we will miss a payment by confusing us,0this app offers the perfect nohassle experience for managing your finances on the go the new clean layout is very easy on the eyes while the simplicity and easy access to all tools makes handling your financials a dream just a simple login and password no jumping through hoops to access your money and alerts that you can customise to let you known when your funds are below a certain amount etc definitely one of my favourite and most useful appsalso love the preview swipe so i can easily see my balance without having to log in,1chase banking app by far is one of the most comprehensive ive seen  offering a lot more mobile vs desktop view options ive seen some people complain about the app crashing or it being able to use fingerprint tech  most likely their phone system is crashing and they may need to update their app ive never had a problem with the mobile app closing or preventing a transaction the accounts quick view is great for people like me who hate logging in but also dont believe in fingerprint tech i gave  stars because how to use chase pay is not as easily evident,1i have been using this app for years and aside from a glitch here and there its worked fine for me  the issues that some have had has nothing to do with the app as someone has mentioned before  like finger touch log in  my only suggestion is when i see the list of my expenditures i would like to be able to select each one and see a better description of who what where along with a phone number to call them  sometimes its difficult to figure out who is charging your account from the first glance  thank you,1chase is by far the best bank in america as far as i know i have tried  different banks they all sucked i payed over  a month in atm fees because non of my banks had atms chase has thousands they also offer awesome checking and savings account plans no outrageous fees i love chase the app is great very handy to keep your balances very easy to navigate around easy online transfers everything is so easy to use on this app and its secure stop reading these perfect reviews just open an account and download the app i just dropped my other bank and it was the greatest decision i made ,1have been on the phone over  hours with  people at chase  they tell me there are known problems with this app and their mobile website  bottom line  there is no way to reset a password  there is not even an option like forgot password  on the phone they can give you a temporary password but neither the app nor their mobile site will accept it instead it sends a message back to use a pc  so if you are traveling with your iphone or ipad and no laptop you have to either find a chase bank or access a public computer in order to log in and reset your password  ridiculous  their account manager said they used to have an award winning app but competitors apps and website are now better  straight from the horses mouth i am taking my money elsewhere,0theres an old idiom which states there is no such thing as new and improved it is either one or the other but not both  this is how i feel about the new version of this appeverything seemed far simpler and seamless about the previous version logging in viewing the alerts etcone thing ive never been able to do and wish i could is edit the payee section of bill paying for that i must use an actual computer this is a minor inconvenienceall in all im grateful for the apps functionality which allows me to take care of banking business in a most convenient way,1i recently switched to a chase credit card the app is very good i particularly like the ability to use my fingerprint to log in however for some reason if i want to make a payment i have to reenter my password not sure why this extra step is needed since i just verified my id with my fingerprint is chase that afraid that someone will gain access to my account and then pay my bill  my other credit card app doesnt require this extra step and although it is a minor thing i find myself using my other card more knowing it is easier to pay the bill something to consider,1i have been banking with chase and have been using the app for a couple of years the issue with the alerts is that when you have multiple accounts you have to go through each and every account to figure out exactly where your alerts are while in the app like a lot of people i dont have my alert messaging pop up on my main screen to protect my privacy i do like a message to tell me that i have an alert so that i can go into the app and check it i would love for the app to go directly to the specific alert it send me a message for other than that the app is great,1i dont have much to add to the praise others have given the chase bank app it works well it saves me a lot of driving to the bank it seems reasonably secure and im glad now that i have an iphone  plus that i can use touch id to get into my bank info in the past i had to open password first find the record for my chase bank account copy the password etc this app also allows me to respond to urgent requests for more money from my college student daughter immediately and without having to do anything more than pull my phone out of my pocket,1this is a great app and suits many of my needs well i have two feature requestsshow the effect on the account that each purchase or payment has for instance if i make  purchase here a  purchase there and pay  to the account i would like to see at each line item what my new balance is as a result of that transaction as opposed to simply just listing it at the topif i have touch id enabled theres no reason to also have to type in my password to use the rest of the app this is simply redundant and using my fingerprint is plenty of enough security to use all the features of the app,1after i started using this app my trips to the bank has reduced to a great extent touch id log in  just love it me and my husband were discussing about it and then we saw on the next app update the feature was in viewing of checks that got paid off again i thought its so painful to log on to the desktop version to see the checks but then they brought that feature in too wire transfer schedule can also be done from the app too i love the constant enhancements that chase keeps bringing in to the app keep up the good work,1frustratingly limited app but so is their mobile site and their customer service is useless as they only allow you to access phone numbers via their mobile site and app instead of the email addresses available via the desktop site and the messages center on the app constantly freezes out and stops working making me have to restart the app and resign in  you get a free credit score with your credit card but you cant check it on your phone in anyway because they wont even let you view their desktop site on your phone anymore anytime you try to it automatically directs you back to their mobile site its incredibly frustrating,0getting straight to the point i get good realtime update uptotheminute the processes and procedures i understand most of them and i believe chase is a great bank and the provisions that i get are second to none i am able to use my iphone to answer alerts and view my account on the spot when i need to manage money very systematically and very accurately i hope this app keeps going the way it does and the research and developers keep it at a class like there are five star hotels there are five star apps this is a five star app thank you very much for your service,1i would love to be able to transfer money to other members of the same bank thru the app also being able to see account numbers would be helpful since i do not have checks to look at while making a deposit i have to give out my debit card and i do not like giving my card out i also have a business account and when on the go i still need to make payroll why cant i do payroll on the app this problem slows down my business why cant i have same day option on payroll it is always a two day long process chase needs to catch up with the times you guys are behind the eighth ball when it come to app banking,1the chase banking app is a great app in my opinion everyone has a different experience but mine has been great if you have a chase credit card you can pay it from the app if you have multiple accounts you can transfer money between accounts effortlessly chase quick pay is also a great feature only problem ive had in  years of using the app is that i couldnt see my funds the two out of thousands of times ive logged in waited an hour or so and the problem was fixed thank you developers,1every month i curse having to pay my bill because this app makes me jump through hoops in order to pay it its as if they really dont want me to besides the fact that it wont remember me and the touch login is gone every single month it forces me to recreate a password and will not use the one i created just the month prior i keep all my password in a safe place so i can reference them so its not like im just typing it wrong or using the wrong one its insane and completely ridiculous to have to do this once in its fairly simple to make a payment but the initial frustration it creates makes me angry once i pay my balance ill probably close the card and just use my other credit card its app is so much more user friendly and has better rewards,0i am a career banker and ive had accounts at numerous financial institutions over the years i do not work for chase in my experience this app is as good as it gets i have banked at chase even while employed by other financial institutions the support security features and functionality are state of the art i have read several reviews here where users state a problem with a feature to bypass entering a password in order to log on thats stupid  dont do that financial theft is real if taking five seconds to type in a password ruins your experience take a pill,1ive been banking with chase for about  years now i began my account while i was in college college life is chaotic and very busy with crammed study sessions classes trying to get enough sleep trying to work as much as possible to afford food this app has been with me every step of the way making one of lifes most important aspects easy secure and manageable i love that you can transfer money with just a few simple taps you can quickly and easily see your account balances its support is amazing too all around the best banking app ive ever come across,1i havent had any issues using this app the atm locator is nice in that it reads your current location and then finds chase atms close by the contact us feature is nice as well just tap on the department and the phone initiates a phone call when you log in you get the mobile web interface for your accounts just like if you had logged in via the webpagewhat would make this app great when loooking at your account details provide a streamlined list the web view takes up way too many lines instead of listing each transaction with  vertical lines build more of a spreadsheet with rows then let me click on the transaction to get details if i want,1i switched from wells fargo to chase because they had the photo deposit feature on the app pro works great have not had any issues with the deposit feature cons too many push notifications  be aware that chase will send you a notification for every transaction to your accounts  turning off push alerts within the settings within the app does not turn them all off  they will keep coming unless you change your push notifications online as well as within the app  now that ive figured this out should be smooth sailing,1i had been waiting for this update for ages since they announced the redesign i had been checking the app store everyday lolthis refresh was more of a requirement than an update for me old app was so so so outdated layout and format wise they have done a good job everything looks good very nicely done but they are stilling missing the peek feature that barclays mobile app has it lets you sneak a peek ur balances instantly without having to sign this feature comes in very handy when i am at the cash register and quickly wanna take a look at my balances n decide which card to use,1i love being able to view my account information pay bills and make check deposits from my iphone however when chase or apple makes updates this is the only app i seem to have issues with after the updates are done both times the issues are with the virtual check deposits i have an iphones and am told by chase that is the only iphone having this issue it will allow me to take the picture but as another user said the use button will not work chase said they are estimated to have this issue resolved by  i hope chase continues to work on getting this app to be more stable for all iphones,1overall the app is convenient for checking funds i also really appreciate the remote check deposit feature because there are no chases in the state in which i attend school or the bordering states another problem chase should fix anyway my biggest pet peeve is the lack of touch id or even pin for logging in it is a feature i love about my discover app i dont want to type out the intricacies of my password with only my thumbs especially on my phone screenthe pin feature would benefit even users without an iphone  or + so i dont see the hold up lets move along as technology does please ,1i am horrible when it pertains to balancing a checkbook not the ability of doing it but just doing it im busier than a bee in spring time with this app i can see my accounts in the fly right away and know where my monies are i am also able to deposit checks from anywhere there is an internet connection even g service i am an office administrator so i get a lot of reimbursement checks and i dont always have time to get to the bank to deposit  thanks chase for an intuitive easy to use time saving personal banker in my pocket it,1love the app i have limited use due to not having a credit card so i cant speak to many of the features the quick pay and statements work well being able to transfer cash between accounts and cash checks on the fly is great my last bank didnt even have an app though so im easy to please idle time out happens way too quickly imo would like a few extra minutes there also unless its just user error i dont like that i cant set a recurring transfer each week you can schedule them but i didnt see one you can set permanently that would be wonderful finally password overkill other than that i think its great,1ive had this app for about two years now my first opinion on this app was hey this is great but using it for a while now its not as reliable everything is always pending so when the transaction goes through it looks as if you made millions of purchases in one day my account was overdrawn so i went into my savings and put money into my checking but about two hours later there was all this money in my account so i called customer service to tell them the problem but my account showed no record of my account being overdrawn so now im out of money that did not have to be spent all because this app was not working properly so in my opinion dont get this app if you use your card frequentlythis app definitely need some improvements,0i have been using the chase app since  it saves me tons of time and makes things like paying bills very simple i love the option for a preview especially when i just need to check my balance quickly the main reason i use the app is for deposits taking  pictures instead of having to drive to the bank weight in line ect also someone got ahold of my debit card information and chase emailed me and sent a secure message in the app chase had already put a stop to the thief before i even knew what happened great app and great bank,1easy to check my accounts balances and make transfers between if needed that process immediately the thing i love best about the app is the notifications  i set a notification up for every time my card is swiped so i am always aware of my cards usage  which is great because im more aware of my spending i know when automatic paymentswithdrawalsdeposits are processed and in the event of a fraudulent transaction i would know when it occurs and can react quicker  ive never had an issue with the app  its quick and easy to access and navigate,1using the generic subject line theyve given me but honestly its pretty accurate very easy to navigate and move funds from one account to another as well as having the take a picture deposit optionreally the most valuable thing about this app and something that is available to anyone regardless of whether you have a chase account or not is the quick pay option the ability to send or receive money directly from your phone is something every bank will soon be jumping on,1the app works well it is fast and the interface is efficient for my purposes i dont really use alertsi do wish i could use touch id to pay my credit card and bills and make transfers instead of having to put in my password i feel like if we are already using it to make purchases with apple pay its probably good enough for making payments to things within our accountsanother issue ive come across is that it disables the touch id popup whenever it pesters me to rate the app id rather it wait to ask me about rating the app until after ive logged in so i dont have to close and reopen the app every time i want to use it,1stop forcing updates to continue there is nothing more annoying than having to update an app to continue using it its worse when the version you have is completely fine and has no problems since day one if the new updated version has slight performance stability i dont care because mines works just fine without it has been since the last  slight performance updates i could care less about some of the new features it might add chances are i will never use them give the consumer the option of continuing to use their current working app if they choose and if they want to update to the new version with the new shiny extras then let them,1i gave a  not a  bc they need to work on the credit card user face there is a long list of all transactions but clear delineation between the monthly balance transactions this is confusing when trying to budget and seeing what you went over on etc also there is no way to search all transactions on the app by name of payee or sum of money you want to find my cellphone is my main method of banking and its especially annoying when im traveling and dont have computer access for a week or three other than those two issues im a fan,1 sustain you fixed the touch id and password double log in  now i just use my fingerprint to pay  time and of my two banking apps you are neck and neck as promised  starsbut improve touch id is not always available at log in my other banking app has a small thumbprint icon on log in screen if ever touch id fails to pop up i simply hit that icon and then it works   of the time at log in i have to close app completely for it to trigger or just manually punch it in  fix this and you are golden navy fed app is the other one  i love chase just gets better ,1compared to both american express and discover apps chase is severely lacking first this is not a problem with the app itself however i believe it still holds merit you cant distinguish between charges incurred by additional card members on a chase account this is beyond ridiculous on chases part second the actual app is beyond basic it seems to be geared as a means to integrate everything chase bank accounts credit cards auto loans etc i think this is a terrible mistake it makes it confusing for the user and most of the time incompatible i have neither a chase bank account mortgage or auto loan from the bank itself ultimately this app needs a lot of reworking and so does the credit card itself i would definitely not recommend the card or app to a pier,0the app updated on its own with a fancy animation of whats new still the annoying advertisement remains on top and the account listing now takes up a whole lot of room so there is a lot if white space and you have to scroll down its pretty but i liked the more condensed interface like the snapshot better and viewing the snapshot just like in earlier versions requires you to cancel out of the fingerprint login and know that you have to swipe to see itits a good app and definitely gets the job done but the mobile ui could be better i would love to be able to opt out of the ads they even show up on the login screen,1i love the new layout however ive had a couple issues since the new update  for a couple days i was not able to view my accounts even after i tried refreshing and logging outlogging back in all the app told me was that my balance was na i had to log onto a computer to view my accounts  i was not able to pay my bills using the mobile app i again had to log onto a computer this time to pay my bills i understand that there is a possibility i was using the mobile app incorrectly but even if this is so i am pretty tech savvy and still could not figure it out please make the app more user friendly,1i love the app it is so convenient to be able to deposit a check from my cell phone and not have to go to the bank i cannot say how much time this has saved me i am so thankful for this feature along with the fact that it will tell you in your text message and your email if you are overdrawn so you can make a deposit before you are charged an overdraft fee i would also like to see the check pictures also but i can go to the computer to see that not an inconvenience at all thank you chase for being the number one bank,1i love chase as a bank for the excellent amount of services they provide for both my personal and business accounts but the access and ability to deposit checks on my phone using this app is just amazing a lot of people have to go in to the bank to make deposits because their atm wont even do it i can do everything from my phone using my camera  ive been with chase  years and they continue to impress me especially when i compare to what i hear from others and the service they get at their bank,1i was really excited about the new redesign from chase hoping it would fix a lot of the ux problems and make it easier to get to the stuff you needed to get to unfortunately it was really disappointing that all they could do was throw on a pretty face on the app with the functionality being basically the same as the old app i was really looking for so much more considering other financial apps that are really leading the way not only in design but functionality step it up chase also fix your secure message center it keeps telling me i have a message when none exists and you cant get rid of this mysterious non existent message,1i couldnt imagine life without the chase app i regularly remotely deposit checks with my phone pay bills check my balance and transfer money as needed i also love receiving notifications of charges on my debit card i have set my notification to anything over  so basically i get a text for every purchase this is a great deterrent against fraudulent charges this is a must have app for me only suggestion i would make is that i would like to be able to view pending bill pay transactions for this i must use my pc,1i am in college and i absolutely love this app for more than one reason if i am ever in a money jam my dad can just quick pay me some money and its automatically in my account within minutes i also love this app because it lets me know where the nearest chase bank is just in case i need to go to a branch i also love this app because it shows the full financial breakdown of incoming and outgoing money through my account and still gives me a balance so i dont have to worry about balancing my money to make sure its correct i just absolutely love this app,1i have used this and other bank apps for over a year chases app is by far the easiest most organized and aesthetically pleasing i love that i can transfer money between my accounts check history account balances atmbranch locations and customize alerts conveniently and quickly  the newer slide to quick view your current balance is handy too the only room for improvement i see is making the alerts show on the specific account instead of having an alerts inbox   otherwise this app is perfect,1chase has hit the mark with best banking apps i know longer need to go to the bank in order to take care of all my banking needs everything one may need to do at the bank  you can now do right on your phone deposit checks check ur balance and statement at any moment  receive an alert in seconds when ur account has been used amp char customer service is extremely helpful if you have any problems or inquires no more fraud chase is a great bankits the easiest way for this girl to get all her banking done from wherever i am thanks chase,1the chase mobile banking app is a very good app it is functional fast and i can get to all of the same information i can access with my desktop the only suggestion for them that i would really really like them to consider is to make it fingerprint accessible on my iphone as my other banking account discover card and american express card are i know it sounds lazy that im trying to skip entering my password but i really like fingerprint access as it is extremely secure and very simple to login for security reasons i maintain a very long and complicated password but im completely comfortable accessing my accounts with my thumbprint not something that is easily hacked,1i have to give it to chase having owned this app for more than two years and not having any issues with it the only issue i am facing is when i upgraded from a iphone s to a iphone s plus i no longer am able to use the finger print scan to enter the app i used to love opening the app place my finger on the home button and have it open within seconds i had it on the iphone s on the iphone s plus i open the app and have to enter my password which is not a short one for security reasons for that reason  stars from me other than that thank you chase for the forever reliable app ,1i have two chase credit cards myself and im also the power of attorney for an elderly relative who has his checking and savings with chase  i love that when i log in as either him or me it shows all the accounts and allows me to transfer and pay from all and even now allows me to transfer between my other checking account at another bank and all the chase accounts  so easy and convenient and i dont have to leave the house  also the alerts remind me to pay my credit cards on time  great app,1i have been using this app now for a few years and it just keeps getting better i love how easy it is to view my balance and transaction history deposit checks and transfer money i do all of these things frequently  and havent actually visited a bank branch in monthschase seems to stay on top of updates which i really appreciate they were one of the first nonapple apps that updated to enable touch id on my iphone which makes accessing by bank account even easierreally happy with this app,1prior versions received an a+ but more recently the updates have been full of glitches when the app works as it should it is absolutely beautifulhowever now i have trouble accessing the server logging in and accessing datathe biggest frustration is remote deposits if i can get it to accept my check photos which seem clear as usual i get error messages that its not available sometimes it just wont let me go farther or i get all the way to submit and it says to try again later really cant you tell me that before i spend  minutes entering data and taking picturesthis update obviously needs more workfor fairness heres my previous reviewim not a big bank fan but its obvious they spend a good deal of effort to create a good intuitive app for their customers deposit or transfer by phone is quick and painless for the most parti love being able to see my payment history as well as credit card and mortgage statementsalthough theres always room for improvement i give them an a+,1it lets you get your mobile banking done but i agree with everyone who says that alerts could be done betterwhen you go into the alert center alerts should be marked as read or unread you should be able to mark them as read one at a time all at once per account or all at once for all accountsi also think it would be nice if you could check off individual items in your transaction history as verified or validated to keep track of entries as you balance your checkbook and the check mark should be modified if the entry changes like if you charged something and the amount is updated to include a tip,1ive had this app for over  years and still enjoy it im able to keep a constant update to my account within a few seconds i also get to track all my expenses and make sure that im not being charged for anything that i havent authorized i also recently got a chase credit card that showed up on my app as soon as i was approved itd be nice if they allowed us to install the app as a widget like other apps such as discover so i can check my account with two swipes i highly recommend getting the app its very stable,1glad to see the integration of the fingerprint unlocking app seems to work well only issue i have noticed is when you dont close the app and return to it later it wont prompt for the thumbprint this forces you to close and restart the app or use the password most everything else about this app is handy and makes the app useful the snapshot check depositing it a great feature and so is the bill and credit card paying all in all it works and has most everything you might need to do with a bank related app,1i use mobile banking apps from chase key bank and bank of america all of them function well and the jpm app seems to be the best organized bank of america though has two cool features this app lacks first when entering a dollar value for billpay the b of a app assumes two decimal places making entry of the digits easier and a bit more idiotproof second when photographing a check for deposit the b of a app captures the image once you center it in your frame no need to push a button this jpm app is terrific and jpm is a great retail bank,1the chase mobile app stands out for page loading speed and for statement access of course the most important feature of a financial institution application is security i havent had this one for long enough to report on security one way or the other however ive accessed chase from my desktop for many years during which time there was only  reported breach and it didnt affect me i look forward to a similarly troublefree customer experience from this mobile app and if i dont get it ill review again,1its extremely frustrating that i have to take the photos of the checks almost  times before the app stops saying the photos arent clear enough if you would enable the use of the light on my phone it would probably help also i have to tap the shutter button over and over and over and over i think you get the picture before it takes the photo this has been an issue with your app since ive been using it for a few years now you would think it would work better but it is actually getting worse other than that the app is functional to what i need to do this is why it gets  stars,1this app is part of my daily life and i like it a lot two problems though,1the little black banner ads are beyond irritating and im personally insulted that the place where i do almost all of my banking and transactions would be polluted with this intrusive nagging little black banner chase never had a problem advertising in a non intrusive manner before and i do hope there is a way to permanently remove this major irritationim not here for you to show me crap in in a banner designed for me to mistakenly press while im here to do serious banking businessthe second problem is the screen which tells you that youve been logged outyes i know its obvious enough if you simply take me to the log on screen but that announcement has to be dismissed each time it pops up it doesnt sound like much but in apps and computer programs clicks matter id rather never be told that bit of useless info just present the logon screenfive stars for ease in daily use minus two stars for the little black banner,1as a ui designer i can see the efforts that the chase mobile design team has put into this app the ui is getting cleaner and easier to read every day the only other thing i would love to see on the home screen would be a reminder of the due dates of my credit cards payments currently i think you have to click in the see the statement to see the dates maybe im wrong but hey im a user if i cant get it right thats probably telling you something overall i like this app and all the updates i have had on it,1thee best bank app hands down chase is it  ive never had any problems with it now only if chase could bring atms back to south bend indiana   they really need to fix the lack of atm issue  as awesome as chase is they will lose customers for this reason  they pulled all the chase atms from the most convenient stores that makes me wonder whats the real issue here  the chase on sr  is so run down seriously youd think chase has enough money to fix this  new management they no longer seem to care about access to banking or appearance anymore cant forget to mention the pot holes and gigantic ponds when it rains  now this is embarrassing ,1the new and improved app is just about perfect only problem is i have difficulty seeing my statement i use my phone most often while viewing my statement but the problem is i cant turn the statement side ways so i can read across the page to see what was charged to whom i dont remember if i could turn it sideways before but now i seem to have a lot of difficulty seeing everything i want to see even by enlarging the screen lots of shrinking and expanding to get the info i need and a lot of blurring even with my glasses on i solid not have that problem before what has changed,1the app to deposit checks is still the best on the market and it was the reason i moved to chase about a year agounfortunately the stability is low aside from often complaining about the image quality even though it is impeccable or the wrong amount even though it is correct it seems that the chase server is often down or overloaded about  in  deposits need to be redone and about  in  days it wont work whatever you do that was so from the beginning on and did not really change with all the updatestypically it helps to use good daylight for the picture to disconnect from the network and connect again or to try again next daythe other ugly thing is the daily and monthly limits come on guys do you really only want customers that make less than that a monthcurrently i still have to go to the bank from time to time because im over those limits thats obnoxiousstill after about year of online depositing there is nothing else like it out there bofa sleeps and the others too,1im an artist subtext budgeting does not come naturally or easy for me i do try but end up flying by the seat of my pants more times than not would be lost with out chases swipequick balance view feature it is quick enough to execute while in line at the register saves me from overdraft and by extension bad purchasing decisions quick pay is another game changer for me i am frequently borrowing money for  weeks and then paying it right back usually to avoid late fees or  overdraft quick pay makes it a breeze i can do it from my phone in  mins or less can schedule it in advance which neutralizes my forgetfulnessnow the next platform im routing for is budget management aid for the financially illiterate too much to ask for thats the problem with convenience it makes us lazy in any case good work chase you have delivered an app that is consistent provides solutions to very real problems and i deem essential props,1this is a really great app super simple and convenient i love being able to transfer easily and deposit checks i especially love the new account preview where you can look at your balance without logging in the only weird things are the message center which is just blank all the time but i dont really care about the messages and that you cant manage alerts from inside the app my suggestions would be in app alert settings and perhaps touch id capabilities so i dont have to type in my super long password every time,1this is handsdown the best app ive ever used we are members of several credit unions and use a couple of banks for different business accounts and loans and the chase app puts chase far above any other bank i have used very intuitive user friendly most apps are annoying but this app gets better and better i love the mobile check deposit and the quick view if the accounts and the ability to view checks and the amazingly easy bill pay if chase offered competitive loans i would not bank anywhere else,0clearly the people who have posted positive reviews are either new to mobile banking or just excited that they can do some things on their phone with their bank account more long term users will be frustrated with the lack of features and in my case errorscase in point try adding a quick pay recipient from your contacts but be warned  if you initially dont enter an email for them which is easy to do from your phone if you only have their phone number under your contacts  there is no way to delete edit or update the contact after the fact which means you can not add them from your phone successfully at all as an email is required attempts to readd the contact with their email gives an error message because youve already added them according to the app having an app that allows you to resolve this simple issue would be covered in basic error check coding  but as i learned years ago as an early adopter of chases mobile banking and the many issues encountered they are bankers not techies either that or they are not supervising or testing their appwebsite developments thoroughly,0this app is not very efficient and is pretty annoying when ive turned notifications off and it constantly notifies me that i spent my money   also whats so wrong with saving my password on my identified iphone  if i lose my iphone ill shut it off remotely or wipe it   nobody can get on my chase app but me using my iphone    save password please other bank apps do  also why so many clicks  as soon as anybody logs in to there bank account by default our checking balance should appear  thats the first thing everyone looks at anyway  not click log on click accounts click checking to finally see the damage   just one clicklog in and poof theres your checking account balance   then if we feel like navigating to the least used savings or other account function we will,1depositing via photo is awesome the app is clean stable intuitive makes you feel a little safer about banking on a phone one suggestion in the accounts section when im viewing balances it would be nice to see when credit card payments are due and what the minimum is the screen looks clean right now but it would be more useful if you could see what you need to pay when and for which cards all at once instead of having to click into each individual account screen nice job though keep it up ,1five stars except for trying to write a review it waits until youve written the whole thing to tell you the nickname you chose is already in use then you have no way to save your review while you try to choose an available nickname the app works extremely well if you take the time to learn all its features whether you intend to use them or not check for updates frequently too before you really need the app have a strong fast connection too just in case updates rarely take more than a couple of minutes,1i use this app all the time and think its great i am a little hesitant about having my banking on my phone but trying to be positive that jp morgan is keeping my info safe i did have an issue a couple year ago where my card number was stolen and being used that had nothing to do with the app just saying in that instance the customer service rep at chase was very good about getting back my money and getting me taken care of quickly that makes me feel at ease that if there was a problem i would be supported in resolving the issue,1update as of april same issues sighok so i love this app but there is one serious flaw that is driving me crazy i happen to have many accounts tagged to my chase login and when i get a mobile alert i have to search through all my different accounts were talking lots of maneuvering through each account bar in the list to figure out which account has the alert i havent figured out a way to get past this but you would think the app would automatically show you which account has the alert or simple put that accountalert at the top of the list in bold or something ,0the app slows considerably between  pm and midnight pt as they cater to us east coast users midnight to  am when its used less not only was it slow i took several pictures of a check that had no blur and continually received an error to retake the photos because they were not clear enough i then tried calling support and the phone overlay would not connect when i did reach chase they had me power down the device u install and reinstall the app and logout then login and i continued to receive the error and the same reply that there was maintenance and try again or go to a branch what happened to the importance of the customer apparently maintenance overrides everything and if you live anywhere not in the east coast youre less important,1i dont use the app every day there may be a week between uses but several times over the last few months it wants my password instead of accepting my fingerprint and when i type in my password that i incidentally have had for at least  years so believe me i know it a message pops up saying it looks like youre having trouble  im not having trouble and dont want to reset my word this time around i gave in and did do but not before having to delete amp reload the app i have called support about this but it keeps happening amp i just dont feel like having to call them every time i want to look at my transactions arrgh,1i love how user friendly this app is i can easily toggle between multiple accounts deposits transfers between accounts bill pay you name it its all on the app  i also love that i can set up personalized alerts if my balance falls below a predetermined amount of my choosing or when a direct deposit comes in as examples it makes it super convenient to help me stay on top of thingsthe only time i ever need to set foot into an actual bank is when im processing multiple business deposits for my job or getting coin rolls,1i do like many if the functions of the chase app allowing quite a bit of access to almost everything in the account then a new release comes out and i think ooh  can it be deposit from my phone alas although they did make a big deal about it after trying to take the picture of  different checks from different sources i found it does not live up to its selfset expectations other than that the app is great but if youre going to brag about a feature maybe it should be tested first but its a free app and if you use chase youre going to download it anyway so i guess this doesnt matter thats my  cents worth,1to everyone complaining about the quick deposit its reading your image electronically so if it cant read the person who wrote you the checks handwriting or you took the picture blurry then it may take a few trys and there are limits to how much you can deposit this way and certain accounts and customers who have overdrawn there account too much arent able to use the service chase is awesome and i love my accounts they have the best technology ever if you dont believe me bank somewhere else before you complain,1if i was rating solely based on the ability to check your balance and even pay off your credit card through the app i would rate  stars no problems therethe problem i do have is that i would like to be able to cash in my rewards through the app which there is no option for i just dont like when an app doesnt provide all the options that a desktop site would i would even be fine with the limits of this app if only the chase website wouldnt insist on converting to mobile when i use safari to try to get to the desktop site no matter what i do even if i start out by going to the desktop website on safari through my phone once i hit login it automatically converts back to mobile with no option to return to desktop or full version im sure its in their interest not to make rewards easy to cash in kidding kind of but it would be great if someone working on the app or website could look into updating one or both to include options for rewards cashinthanks,1i was really disappointed by this update actually  i was hoping an easier log in method like how the discover app had an option to log in with a pin number  would be added and switching between any tabsfeatures is pretty laggy for me now i was expecting a pretty big overhaul and they kind of set it up as that like the email earlier in the month kinda hyped it up but all they did was take six months to do what everyone else did in a few weeks which was update the aesthetic which isnt very impressive either its kind of boring and somewhat awkward with the random green on the deposits panel and they didnt even really update the ipad app yet,0i never write reviews but i felt compelled to after attempting to use chases newest update to its app  it seems like the chase app has regressed back in time i wont rehash what everyone else has commented about but the one thing i have not seen written about is this issue with billpay i would like for us to be able to setup reoccurring bill payments in billpay  i dont know why this ability is not currently setup and no dont tell us to go to the www to set up recurring payments what good is having an app if were unable to perform the task and then we are sent to the web to do the tasks i might as well bypass the app completely and do all my banking on the web this is one of the worst app updates ive ever seen from chase,1this app was awesome on the iphone still pretty good and fast on my ipad before the latest upgrade if you can even call it that on my iphone prior to the upgrade the app ran really fast no glitches i would input my password and in literally  seconds i would have no issues logging in now after this so called upgrade it takes forever to load cant even start inputting my password for quite a bit then once in it takes a while to click on your balance and get the balance breakdown i dont know whos idea it was but this upgrade was truly not an upgrade at all on the bright side its still pretty fast on the ipad,1some people told me the bank apps were ifffy not to trust them  i decided to try it out anyways its very useful hows the security  well each time you open the app it immediately asks for your password and if your logged in too long it logs you off i also find it useful to swipe to the right without putting my password in to look at my accounts summaries you could enable it you can deposit checks transfer money i could even pay my chase credit card card in seconds very useful,1i love the convenience and the alerts its saved me from fraud twice now both times right after a trip got an alert when my card was used in the town i visited even though i was back home i get the password prompt after touch id someone could be trying to transfer money while your asleep and you may not know theyve touched you finger to the device my problem is half the time i try to do some things i get the message that this feature isnt available right now i have gotten it at various times of the day updates should be done and your least busiest times,1great app except for one big thing looking at your checking account history on the app and what is really the status of your account regarding pending transactions and ones that have posted sometimes does not match up and when your balance is dangerously low to zero or even overdrawn and you need to make a deposit before the cutoff time nsf charges happen quite often do not rely on top of it with the app the timing of things is off if i could keep my balance always above  i would but i cant otherwise great app im really liking the touch access and the quickpay is great,1before the recent upgrade their fingerprint security would allow you to full operations within the app  now you have to enter your password to pay your card or sign up for chase quickpay using a pc or mac interface this defeats a lot of the purpose of having the fingerprint convenience their techsupport said to uninstall and redownload the app which would not solve this problem it seem to take several login tries before the fingerprint option would appear after resetting a password discover also required a reset after the last software upgrade but does not have trouble with the fingerprint option,1i love the swipe feature to preview my accounts not having to log in makes it very convenient to use i also like how the app allows me to do everything i need for instance quickpay and depositing the check however the check deposit feature can be a paintimeconsuming i remember times when the app didnt allow me to deposit the check because it didnt accept the photo of the check though i thought it showed good resolution fortunately i dont need to deposit check that often and therefore no need to constantly experience the inconvenience so when i do ill use the atm machine,0this app is fine if all you need is the total balance on your credit card but if you want to pay your bill and need the balance owing the statement closing date and the date you need to pay by then forget it it is completely useless it also doesnt provide a running total of your balance so you can figure out what you need to pay based on the closing date if you already know that i use other bank apps and this is the worst of them all because of this lack of basic necessary information and because of crashing issues when signing in with a fingerprint i gave it  stars because you can check your activity with it which is useful and get the total owing,1love being able to send money to friends and family and accept check deposits with my phone so convenienti also love chases fraud alert system had my credit card used three different times in a few namebrand department store in a different state for under  each i was sent a text alert email alert and a phone call to verify authenticity very impressed that the thieves were spotted with such low spending thank you chase not crazy about the alert section so i couldnt give it  stars the messages can be redundant and their in no way to figure out which account it is for,1i have been a chase customer since i joined washington mutual this franchise has served me very well and awesome staff on every branch i gothere are only two little issues on the app to be addresses first is the account activity they really need to break down on the balances after withdrawing and purchases to see on where people are spending their moneyfinally the alerts themselves sometimes they send dates from old balances and it does not focus on the current onesother than that i will always be a chase customer cause of great customer service outside the app,1i have been using chase for the past  years and im fully satisfied the biggest benefit of having this app is you can always check your accounts on the go its well organized and easy to use as well as managing your finances they send text messages to confirm any unusual activity and remind you of any payments that need to be made which is very helpful with having a busy schedule i love the fact that i can deposit checks online saves me a ton of time and energy would definitely recommend this app to everyone,1i agree with smileycarrs review the alerts section is frustrating to navigate im not going to repeat the whole review but its all what i would say also  i cant seem to figure out how to use take action on an alert from the app because two pop up and only one has an option to transfer money if i dont immediately take action there should be a way to bring up the alert again but i cant find it unless i drill down into the app so i use sms alerts and transfer money or take action that way  which seems redundant since i have the notification from the app the app needs to update to accept touchid,1if only their website lookedfunctioned this well app is very good and very easy to use the reason it doesnt get  stars is that the messaging center can be difficult to use sometimes it doesnt work and when you get an alert theres no way of knowing what account the alert pertains to if all you have is a checking account thats not a problem but if you have checking savings and a couple credit cards with chase they dont tell you which of those accounts has an alert other than that super easy app to use i never walk into their branches anymore as a result,1update i discovered belatedly that i do have full access to all my recent transactions from this app i now rate it five stars its functionality is great and i love the fingerprint sign in first my  most significant disappointment with this app is its inability to display recent credit card transactions the main thing i want to do on my mobile device is to be able to see card transactions at restaurants shortly after the purchases are madesecondly i am disappointed that the fingerprint id feature does not consistently work,1i live in a remote area where the closest city is  hrs away not living here by choice but i love chases options for online banking and this app has made my life in the middle of nowhere much easier many of their capabilities are not advertised and i can see why they dont have to it speaks for itself some capabilities chase has had for years other banks are finally catching up but since chase has been doing it for such a long time the app works great never had a glitch or any kind of error the best app wish other apps worked as great as this one,0i kept my chase bank account primarily because it was so easy to use mobile deposit to deposit my checks over the last six months the app has been gradually declining in usefulness at first it only had an error message when trying to open it once in a great while though it would sometimes shut off when trying to photograph a check now i rarely get the app to work maybe  out of  tries i try over and over throughout the day sometimes  or  times in a row and continually get the same error message to try back later it seems to work best around am cst so i guess if you only need the app to cash checks and youre a night owl youve got it made ive removed the app readded it made sure to keep it updated nothing works,1there is nothing you cant do in this app at least nothing ive tried to do its perfect for those times you want to make an extra payment in between billing cycles you can view your entire statement recent charges recent payments payment due dateminimum due etc it lets you link accounts to pay your bill from which means  click payments easy peasy  even i can do it  ive never encountered a technical issue or had a problem of any sort with it highly recommend  its a must have for chase customers,0while i appreciate having an app that i can use for such services i am amazed that every institution feels compelled to change the appearance and performance of their appwebsite under the guise of improved for your enjoymentsafetyease of use etc  if i didnt like it before i wouldnt have used it  why do all the apps go to this vertical screen only mode after an update  why do these institutions feel the need to move everything around  just when you get used to where everything is located and are comfortable with using it bam  here comes the big changeup and now you get to spend two more years figuring it out  in a nutshell i used to like this app but i dont think ill be using it anymore,1i been having chase way before when it was washington mutual it was then transferred to chase and i have never had a problem with chase i have also never had any problems or issues with the app and i have switched through many phone companies and i am picky but with chase i like the fact that they are loyal with me and i am loyal with them and this app allows me to manage and use the text alert its so easy and convenient and i can use the verifone which its so convenient thanks chase and keep up the great work,1this is a good app overall i like the easiness and cleanliness it makes it easy to understand however i wish they had the total balance due per transaction just like how bank of america has it it doesnt show the balance per transaction how bank of americas app has it it only shows how much you have spent and the total balance at the top its easier to know where your money goes organize yourself financially you keep better track if it shows the balance for each transaction you made and not jut one total balance in the top this is why i am giving  starts only,1the deposit feature is much improved in this version theyve finally made it so a person does not have to keep rotating the phone between front and back check photos much quicker for a person like methat mostly used the deposit feature way more than anything elsenext convenience for me would be a big ole deposit  button right when the app lunches actually i havent completely explored the newest versionmaybe that is in prefs but at any rate a very nice improvement ,1love using this app  ive been a customer for at least  years and have been using the app almost weekly  quickpay is great for sending or receiving money without actually having to meet up with the person although it does take a few days  i check my balance all the time and what was taken outdeposited just as easily as if i were using my computer  i do wish it were a little easier to find my account and routing number for taxes each year but aside from that keep up the great work,1two problems with the mobile app if your balance is negative they dont allow a mobile deposit this is the very time i want to use the mobile deposit feature so i dont end the day in the red and get a fee two i need access to bill pay and check copies in the mobile site i realize this is more standard across all banking mobile sites but chase wants to portray that they are tech innovators then they should improve their mobile site to help their clients by providing them with what is they need i do  of my finances on my phone so i need an app that can support that so that i can get that number up to ,0deposited my first check for just bellow  to find out i could not deposit another check now i have to walk around with an endorsed check which i hate to do had i known it had a limit i would have not endorsed the nd check until i got to the bank even though i was able to deposit the first check it only went through after a rd try they make look so easy on the commercial but in reality it is a pain in the behind example you are supposed to put the check on a black non shining surface instead of holding in your hands so guess what chase i cannot hang my coat and hat and stay at home and relax i still have to go to the bank to deposit that nd check i should have not even done the st one,1this app is perfect for all the quick banking needs depositing checks at your convenience checking balances making payments transferring money between accounts scheduling quickpay etc the only couple of things that could make it more efficient is to be able to search for specific transactions like you can do on the website and that a copy of the deposited checks from the phone be saved on your account for future reference like when depositing through an atm i highly recommend the app though it even sends you alerts that you can customize to your preference,1for the most part i do like it but what i dont like about it is that if you have a savings account as well a checking account there is a little bug in the app the reason i say this is because you can only have six withdraws or transfers to your checking account from your savings now that doesnt seem too bad its understandable but it will still allow you to transfer more money from the savings account and it doesnt tell you right away that you have reached your limit of six withdraws or transactions or even a mixture of both there for taking five dollars after each transaction after the six transactions have been used,1when i got to starbucks this morning i realized that i forgot my purse so i didnt have my debit card however i wasnt worried about going to starbucks because i could use the app on my phone this made me think that if chase could implement the same technology to scan my phone at the atm i could type my pin and be able to withdrawal the cash i need to be on my way just a suggestion it is the world we live in that we remember our iphones and not our wallets chase has been on the cutting edge of mobile banking and this seems to be a logical next step,1everything on this app works great up until i try to deposit a check sometimes it works perfectly fine but then when i need my check deposited asap and the banks are closed today holiday it decides it wants to crash every time i try to take the photo other than the frustration of trying to deposit a check every once in a while even though thats what they boast about having the ability to do with this app its a great app worth a good  stars which is me being nice considering this issue is making me want to throw my phone across the street,1i like this app i still prefer the old user interface before the major over haul but ive grown to like this new interface  one thing that i have been wanting since the longest is for memos for quick pay to appear in the to do list so when confirming payments guy can see what each transaction is for rather than having to go to the activity page and search for that sordid transaction to see what it was for  if you have used venmo i would like it to be something like that where you always see what you are paying for or being paid for,1i like this app it is handy to check my balance throughout the day when i am shopping etc  unfortunately chase does not update the account quickly enough so i have to be careful when my balance is low you would think that a national company like chase would be able to update their account in live time  macu amp afcu both do this because i have savings accounts with them  also their fees are very high for almost any transaction they charge for  otherwise they are personable and polite whenever ive had to deal with them,1this app is great i have multiple credit cards with chase and accessing each of them from the app is easy i can pay off the card see my balance and unlike some other credit card apps that i use it is easy to calculate how much ive spent over time i also enjoy being able to access the ultimate rewards portal from the app incredibly useful when im planning vacation but dont have a laptop available cant say enough good things about how user friendly and intuitive this app is,1i just began using this app on my ipad mini and iphone  it isnt optimized for the ipad screen which means it is only using part of the screen territory it gives me the basic info available off the web site for my account the size of the statements in the app are small but can be zoomed in and out they can also be opened in another app like ibooks or pdf reader where one can use the ipads full screen the image of icon to open them elsewhere isnt very easy to see however one can also make use of the finger print id feature to login and simply swipe without signing on completely to see only the balance info,1i never thought i contemplate the day when i would be using the chase bank app on my iphone issues regarding security kept me away from discovering the undeniable convenience of accessing my account this way the added plus to be able to access my account with the touch option makes it easy and more secure life has definitely gotten much more easier with this app which from now on will definitely help as much as using it in my desktop but now i can also use it anywhere else a keeper  shinning stars,1ive actually been banking online since  when there was no web banking and i had to use an old phone cradle modem to connect directly to the bank when i got the iphone  the first week it came out i was happy to see this app arrive  and im still using it almost  years later on ios  i do everything on it over the years theyve updated it a number of times the only issue i have is that i have two chase accounts personal amp business but i can only use touch id on one that may be an apple thing  not a chase problem who knows and who cares this works just fine for my day to day needs i do like that now the login requirement to pay bills once youre logged in with touch has been eliminated  update  one problem i have is that when the app is updated im forced to update to even use it i dont like updating until i read what people think about the new update stop forcing the issue or fix it,1it does the basics but i would like it to notify me through the apple notification and through apple wallet of all my recent charges without having me go through the chase app to clear every notification those who have amex may understand what i mean more importantly there needs to be a dedicated touchid login button whenever i open the app it prompts me to sign in with my fingerprint but if i get some sort of notification like how do you rate this app that prompt goes away and i have to close the app and reopen it to login with touchid not a big deal but other apps citi have enabled this feature so why not have it for chase too,1the app itself seems fine but for some reason it somehow locks me out of accessing my account every month or so despite entering correct usernamepassword information in fact i set up touchid to avoid that happening but the app seems to forget that and requires the input of my password which it promptly rejects after first input due to too many attempts have tried calling customer service several times but they only reset and do not care to identify the problem save to tell me its not from another person trying to access my account super annoying i have an app to make this easy and its anything but,1i use this app all the time to check how much i have in my accounts as well as electronically depositing checks because i cant drive myself to the bank deposits happen fairly quick and withdraws register almost immediately some devices might not be able to deposit checks with it depending on the quality of their camera also it would be nice if we could access more of our account information like routing number etc on the app but i understand the security reasons,1i havent had most of the problems others are complaining about just two things have been longrunning issues first the alerts icon will show a number  indicating number of alerts but when you drill down into them they are all blank for all accounts i know they should be there after getting texts with similar content second deposits will let you get all the way through specifying account amount and photographing both sides and not until you submit will it say you already exceeded your deposit limit for the month,1i use this app nearly everyday  chase has consistently been ahead of the curve technologically speaking for many years and it shows with this application  i was an early adaptor to using this app and ive never looked back  my husband banks with pnc and was amazed as new advances with chase unfolded  deposits by taking pictures of the check deposits without envelops or deposit slips  quickpay  omg i havent had to go to the bank in forever  if i have a question i can ask online and get a timely response  i hope chase continues to set the bar with great service great app,1i have been with chase for many many years and although they are not perfect they always try to give better customer service they were the first to develop an app to do online banking which i loved from inception the new and improved app is absolutely fantastic i love the colors and how easy it is to go from one account to another even the cute greeting at the top is nice the best thing about this app is that i have never had it malfunction or crash and i trust all the security measures in place way to go with online banking chase,1i have been using this app for a few years now and it just keeps getting better you can do things with the chase app that you cant do with an app from a small bank you can get just about everything done thru the app it has restrictions for password and other changes that are security measures i dont mind that at all i love that i can see checks statements deposits pay bills make deposits and transfer money its a one stop shop i have a small biz and i use it all the time bravo chase,1ive used almost all the banking apps available yes ive had accounts everywhere im very organized with my money and chase hands downno competition has the best banking app i can literally do anything with the app except deposit cash haha favorite feature is the bill pay and chase quick pay i can send money to anyone at any bank or even request money granted the recipient has to log in to chase but still its so convenient im in the financial industry and have seen them all chase comes out on top by a ton,1i love the chase app i use it daily to check balances make deposits transfer funds both to other internal and external accounts i can easily see my upcoming bill payments edit existing ones or schedule new payments the app is very user friendly no complaints chase as a bank is great as well very friendly amp helpful branch staff my teenager goes in frequently and loves how respectful she is treated a couple of the tellers even know her by name now never had that kind of service from other banks national or local great job chase,1this app is very handy to have and works well couple of feature requests make it easier to find and copy the account balance and balance due from the last statement i pay bills thru another bank and in the app i have to open the last statement pdf and awkwardly copy the balance to paste into the other bill pay app no ebills available i guess they are direct competitors on the web site its easy to find copy and paste but not in the app for alerts it would be nice if the account with the alert was already selected when navigating to the alerts view screen,1the app is handy its nice to see pending transactions and the ability to instantly transfer funds i love swiping to the side to see how much is available for funds the only thing that drives me crazy is the fingerprint to access my account only works when it feels like it which is about  of the time the reason i initiated it in the first place is when i really need to access my funds its likely when im multitasking and something as menial as typing in a password tends to mess up the multitasking i was trying to focus on if this could be fixed that would be fantastic,1this is the best bank app ive ever used i always had chase credit cards until recently when i found myself with issues that required seeking a new bank credit card carrier but i had not ever really paid bills using apps this was by paper or at imac added to other computer work while these other bank apps finally did work on my ios phone s it wasnt without phone effort so time required and memory of this meant i dont use the bank apps i now have a  great card from chasethe app was seamless,1cons  the touch id was very convenient but no longer works for the app also when youre reviewing messages and alerts you have to delete onebyone it would be helpful to be able to check each message and delete as a group versus opening each one to delete also having the ability to set up new bill pay accounts via the app would allow more convenience for the account holder pros  its convenient to have the ability to snap two pictures to deposit a paper check versus having to go to a branch or atm i also like being able to quickpay and pay bills from the phone,1ive been with this bank for awhile and i have to say that im very happy with this bank i had an issue where my account was tampered with fraud and to say that the manager and colleagues very helpful w me and assisting in every way possible to address the issue and helped me with acquring another checking account and that issue was resolved and i continued to stay with chase banking im a very happy person  i love the way they handle every customer who walks in very courteous and willing to assist thank you for all your continued support and im very satisfied,1i really love my chase bank app it works well and its easy to navigate through the only issue is deposits sometimes work quick and at times take several days to eventually post to my account even when the deposit bank source is the same source and dollar amount a bit odd i do highly recommend the chase bank app especially on my iphone   deposits before pm on a business day should not take    business days to post from suntrust checking into my chase checking account unacceptable ,1while i cant compare chases mobile banking app to those of any other banks given that chase is the only bank ive used mobile banking with i have to say that ive never had any issues with it even more than that right now its the only form of online banking i have access to because for whatever weird reason my computer doesnt want to open chases website under protected browsing so unless i go into a branch the mobile app is my only banking option so in short im just glad this app exists at all,0i got my new iphone in feb  and set up touch id with all my mobile apps chase mobile app has given me nothing but trouble since then weekly the touch id becomes unusable and i am required to sign in with my password i enter the correct password and the app tells me im wrong have made too many attempts and need to reset the password i try to reset password to correct password and it tells me i cant do it because thats the current password go back and enter the password i was just told was correct and i get the password error message if i put in a knowingly wrong password i just get an incorrect password screen does not tell me i need to reset makes me not want to use chase  i cant be going to the desktop all the time to make payments,1first off thank you for getting onboard with touch id ive been waiting for this feature for a long time so im very happy its finally here next i love chases quickpay i use this multiple times a month to quickly shoot money between my fiance and myself its instantaneous so we have our money within seconds my only gripe would be that sometimes i check my balance by sliding to the right at the home screen and it will say na idk what thats all about  its not often enough to be a deal breaker for me thoughkeep up the good work chase app engineers,1i live in fort worth texas yet our local image on the app is apicture of dallas this is not dallas too bad such an important detail fails to be important to chasei have had accounts at a few other banks in my life and i cannot say enough about the service at chase bank i use the app all the time its awesome the people in the auto loan department one person in particular could use some customer service training extremely unhelpful and rude i have  stars because everything else ive experienced exceeds that issuethanks chase,0the new app may be neater or more hip or rad but it does less went to check my credit card accounts and to get information it keeps referring me to the cards institution website i cant find my statements their details etc anymore on one site not as convenient as it was previously or other credit card sites does show current transactions but details unavailable personally find the new app almost pointlessuseless might as well just go to the main full site wheres that app or a spot on the mobile app you can click on to get to it bring back the old app conveniences with the new look and itll be killer sick or whatever other new hot sayings to fit the new gen look,1must have app you can monitor multiple accounts including checking accounts and credit cards  this app is constantly updating your accounts and balances are updated immediately  you can deposit checks by taking pictures  you can do pretty much anything in this app that you can do in person besides open an account what else could you wantthe only con to this app is that credit card balances only update around midnight but they do post as pending immediately ,1the new version changes how the default account is selected for bill pay previously when setting up a new bill payment it would default to using the same account used previously now it defaults to whatever the first account is in your profile according the list in the apps menu this caused me to go accidentally negative in a checking account i deliberately keep a small balance in now i have to remember to take the extra step every time i schedule a payment to change the account this wouldnt be as big of a deal if the previous versions of the app hadnt trained me to not worry about that,1this app works well i have seperate accounts in different states and it lets me transfer over immediately all my transactions are accurate including those pending i get alerts for deposits and now there is no need for me to guess if i still have  i just open the app plus if i need atm locations or contact customer service its so much faster than calling the  on back of your card i love it i dont know what im going to do when i move to omaha  guess i can travel back to texas to do my bankingwell worth it,1many apps lack essential easeofaccess features for average users chases new preview feature especially is well thought out and very useful its has well integrated abilities to do almost all of my online banking from my mobile device quick pay transferring funds paying bills and checking account balances are all seamless in their app along with access to find branches and contact the company when necessary great app minimal glitching and variety of useful features do recommend for any chase account holder,1the chase app makes banking a snap chase is my wife and is main bank where we hold our primary checking savings credit card and mortgage with the app its easy to deposit checks make internal and external transfers make mortgage payments and monitor all accounts at once anytime anywhere i also love that they added touch id for the login it makes it that much easier and convenient i just deposited a check after using touch id to login and didnt have to retype my password brilliant keep up the great work chase,0i have contacted chase bank and had my information synchronized for one session logon was successful however  the unfavorable behavior is back i have to change my password every time i would like to see my banking information i would like to rate the app well but this is a huge inconvenience and extremely frustrating to be honest i am not at all comfortable every entering all my information in to set a new passwordmost often i am on the go and have to be very careful with onlookers the point of a user id and password is so that no one else will see or know my personal informationi feel like this app put customers a a huge security risk mobile phones and app are suppose to be accessible in the public,1i generally like this app as it is easy to use and navigate one thing i would like to see improved is when you are notified of their alerts on the app now when you login and go to view alerts  it should drop to you on the main page and not with in the first account  also for each account thats listed there should be a number indicating how many new alerts for each account that way you only have to look under each the ones that have alerts that would speed up navigation on that page quite a bit,1i have multiple accounts and can manage them all in one convenient place if i ever have a problem customer service is almost always able to help me the only downside is that there are criminals who want to build a name by hacking a big bank like chase fortunately they are diligent about fighting cybercrime there have been occasions where the site was unexpectedly down for emergency maintenance but id rather that than to be hacked they do a decent job trying to protect their customers from fraud the app makes my life easier,1this is an awesome app and great bank i am a mathematically challenged english teacher obviously not drowning in dough either  this apps alerts and ability to transfer from anywhere has thwarted numerous overdraft disasters  additionally it allows me to transfer money to my college student daughters account wherever  i might be when shes calls with cries of destitution  although it has on occasion been a little slow to access  or so seconds i have never had a problem getting in  its ease of use and convenience has made my financial affairs a breeze,1i have been using this app for the last  months and has worked great very user friendly easy to check balances with my accounts schedule payments ext  they also give plenty of notification if there will be any downtime due to upgrades this has only happened twice since ive started using the app and usually only down for a couple of hours highly recommend to anyone with a smartphone or tablet who wants fast and accurate access to their accounts a++++,1overall usability is good almost everything you needpoints to be improved touch id sometimes it does not appear and you either need to close app or provide password what is the reason of asking password after touch id its like custom fifth wheel in the middle of the car its redundant and absolutely not user friendly moreover it does not provide me extra level of security app should be convenient for user first of all please add more robust functionality for cash back rewards there is calendar of rewards current promo if any this would be helpful and definitely very convenient,1im really not sure if i did this before but its worth sending again if i did  been a customer since way before bank  acquired smaller bank where i was the bank in colorado where i was has a much more peoplefriendly atmosphere than where i am now in la i really miss the small local banks of yesteryear but chase has progressed well use app often never have been much of an electronic user but uve made it so easy to take  step at a time to learn what i need to do amp so far i like using this  even tho ive gotten caught offguard when app has updated thx,1this app is great for the online banker  i have been with chase for over  years since when bankone existed  i have always dealt with my account and paid bills online however i have always need to go in to deposit a check my move to dc made that very difficult since chase has some sort of blackout no chase banks in vadc  this app now allows me deposit checks without messing up my schedulethe app can be made userfriendly and since they keep updating it they seem to know this,1i have had few issues with this app i appreciate the ability to do finances on the go seems safe i do appreciate that chase seems to continue improving the technical quality of the app in reading a few of the other reviews i do agree that the lag time between scheduling a paymentdepositrewards could be handled better sometimes i feel like i have to wait a couple of days to see what is actually happening but all in all i have been pleased with chase on the whole including this app,1i enjoy the touch to open app feature ive read other reviews where theyve had issues with it not coming up consistently however that hasnt been the case with my mobile device from being able to deposit checks to transferring between accounts bill pay seeing cancelled checks the alerts for deposits to name a few this app makes banking online a bit easier i realize theres room for improvement so waiting for the the next update,0i take the picture of the check then go thru all the steps for it including making sure the acct and routing number is correct when i hit submit it says the picture is not clear enough well why the hell didnt you tell me this before i could have gone back to take the picture this is pretty annoying and stupid to tell me at the end that the picture is not good enough and as another person pointed out they have added a stupid dialog box when you go to take the picture of the back of the check i know what to do stop trying to tell me the same thing every time and again and again why is it so hard to make a common sense app and workflow,1for the most part i find the chase mobile app to be very good and easy to use my only real criticism and its why i dinged them a star is the notifications when my app pops up with a notification badge i should be able to open the app and go directly to the alert but no i have to jump through hoops to find it this is true because i have more than one account related to the app the app doesnt take you to the alert for that account but dumps you into your list of accounts and then you have to find the account with the alert dumb and ridiculous,0i love chase banking but i cannot stand the mobile app it constantly has problems they run out new versions all the time and the online site is usually under construction and has limited access it is really frustrating when i just want to pay my credit card bill and there is a problem after you click on pay bill you think it would be easy to follow through with giving them money but it is a maze every month to navigate through the process to finally be able to submit most of the time i get to the pay bill screen and i cannot click on anything to proceed any further i hate this app and constantly debate switching banks solely because of it i hope something positive is done before i jump ship and move on,0i would have had no problem giving the previous version of this app five stars and while the new update is sleek and seems to do just about everything the old app did your account ledger now only shows credits and debits but not the running balance and how it has been affected by each credit and debit now im forced to use my cell phones web browser to go to their actual website on my phone if i want to see my accounts balance as it is affected by each transaction i dont want to just see the amount of each credit and debit i want to see each credits and debits impact upon my running total pretty app but give me information before pleasing aesthetics,1i love this app its completely userfriendly and fun to just look through even if you were broke or owed a lot of money looking through the app would take your mind off of your financial crisis just because of how it looks its just really cool and very convenient it looks modern and feels modern my only tiny almost minuscule complaint is that once in a blue moon when not on wifi or even more rarely when you are on wifi it will take forever to log you in again minuscule but i would really like for that not to happen at all thanks for this awesome update,1i think chase was one of the first banks to have the feature of check deposit using this app i live about  miles from the nearest branch so it is great not to have to drive to town the newest version still has a bug with touch id and doesnt work all the time sometimes you have to open and close the app to get it to work the only thing i dont like about chase bank is they wont let anyone other than yourself deposit cash into your account due to money laundering i almost change banks because of it,1i already love chase as a bank and the app just makes it so much easier i dont agree with the previous reviews that say that the password after the touch id is redundant if you log in with your password then you wont have to reenter it but if you use the touch id then you have to enter ur password before sending money as an extra precaution for those who have other peoples fingerprint saved in the touch id best friend significant others etc and the design of the app is so modern one of the best looking banking apps,1excellent app the people who have complaints about this app have not taken the time to properly setup the appfor instance besides being recorded in the app all alerts instantly appear on the front screen of my ip + no matter what i am doing with my phone i see alerts as soon as they are sent by the bank just one example of people not taking a few minutes to customize the app to their needsexcellent app no complaints extremely easy to use i wish all apps worked this wellif you do any banking at chase you need this app instant information about everything you need regarding your account i switched to chase several years ago after being with bofa and wellsfargo for many years im glad i did chase sets the standards im never going back to my former banks im a chase customer for lifethis mobile app is another example of their superiority in their field,1i love chase and their app is top notch compared to the other bank i use td their app is fantastic tds app is terrible and chase has put the time and effort to develop an appropriate app for their customers making payments on my credit card is incredibly simple and i can transfer money whenever id like with no issue even something as simple as transferring money to my card balance from my points is super easy whereas you have to call a completely separate branch to have your points applied with td ill never leave chase,1installed this app when it first came out and i use it constantly to monitor my accounts deposit checks transfer money etc in all the years ive had it i dont think its been down for maintenance more than once or twice during the time of day i would want to be using it and its never let me down never made a mistake or not recorded a transaction correctly it has just really made my life so so much easier because i can be in charge of my banking while im on the road or wherever i am,1overall this is a very convenient and well designed app the menu has become a little bit cluttered over time as they have added more features but i think it is still very easy to use and lets you do almost as much as you could do from their desktop sitei only use the desktop site for search functions and downloading statements at this point for simply checking accounts and doing some basic tasks the app can do everything and its very easy to use,1i feel comfortable using the app i havent had any problems except once when it was down because of an update i believe not sure didnt quite understand one night and i could not swipe my card was declined nor take out money from the atm which was very inconvenient especially when all of my money was in my account this happened midmay  i only hope that doesnt happen again in the future other than that i am happy banking with chase and pretty happy with the app a lot of useful features that help keep track with my accounts,1its refreshing to see a bank recognize and invest in user experience and design for mobile it makes all the difference and having arguably the best designed and executed mobile app is the reason i continue to bank with chase apps comprise  of my interaction with my banking today and its amazing how few financial institutions have failed to recognize the strategic importance of mobile hats off to the chase mobile team and their executives who get it your wisdom will pay off handsomely with my generation,1this app does it all havent had any troubles whatsoever that others have brought up funds always available within  hours and sometimes within hours using the check deposit feature money transfers have gone off without any hiccups this latest feature added to the mobile app is quickpay i was always annoyed i had to login to the webpage to setup and accept moniesnot anymore still need to enter password for other less used services but overall i love this latest update,0i think they are ok i just dont like the fact that when ever you think there has been fraud in your account they dont stop it right  away its like you have to go through all of these extremitys in order for you to be able to stop it meanwhile wells fargo when you called them in and you think that someones been using your credit card without your permission they actually stop the payment right away and they place your money back in your account just wanted to express that about chase thats the only thing that i dont like about them but ive been banking with them for over six years still thinking though if i should go to wells fargo  is just that ive been with this bank for so long and thats the only thing that stops me,1i like the app and use it frequently but its not friendly for people who have multiple chase cards  alerts  i can never figure out which card has a new alert nor within the set of alerts  find out which one is read or unread gti would like to see all alerts in one screen and have last  digits of card number along it and have a view to filter by specific card transactions list i have click on individual cards to see the activitygtwould like a view for last  transactions by default and have the card number somewhere within,1i appreciate not only being able to use touch id to sign in but also that i have my personal accounts and my business account on the same page without having to relog in order to view details the only drawback ive seen is that transfer times between personal accounts whether from my business to my personal or my personal to another personal is  days why should it take  days to pull from one account and add to another when businesses can get their money either the same day or one day later,1so i think this app works fairly well and ive had very little trouble with iti do agree with some of the frustrations listed in these reviews about touch id if i log out there is no way to log back in using touch id without closing the app and restarting it a minor annoyance but still an annoyance that i dont have with competitors appsmy one real gripe is that the bill pay feature in the app does not include a recurring or repeat payment option it appears you have to login to chase online banking from a computer if you want to set that up really lame you web designers all of your competitors apps have that feature in their mobile banking apps but youi could give you guys a break if this app was only a year or two old but it seems most of the updates involve solving coding problems rather than adding new features perhaps your management team needs to make some changes to their software technical staff and get this thing straightened out,1i love the one swipe see your balance option in a world where checks are obsolete pending payments can give you a false reality to the amount of available cash you have in your account but while watching for a payment to post that one swipe allows me to ensure that the payment was made as scheduled i would love to see the developers come up with a way to see payments on a calendar view rather than list it just makes more sense i love chase and the mobile app thanks chase for doing what you do since using your app i now have more free time to do what i want to do,1i love this app since it saves me time by not having to go to the bank for deposits its also very easy to transfer between accounts transfer to others via quick pay and overall super simple to use i also love the touch id pad which reads my fingerprint to log me in via my iphone if you have chase accounts this is a must have ive turned friends and family onto this and they are mad at themselves since they hadnt used it before i told them about the simplicity of it,1i have been using this app for  years and i have never had a single problem i have  accountsone for myself and one for both my children it has been great for us  we can deposit checks without having to go to the bank which is amazing they are both in college and i can see their account balances make deposits in their accounts or transfer money to them when they need something or their account is low works great and is better than our credit union app love it,1i am constantly amazed amp grateful for this app  ease of use intuitiveness and accuracy  i use it constantly finding a nearby atms paying  of my bills transferring funds anytime receiving alerts amp reminders  i really like the convenience of signing in with my thumb print  after one of their nonstop upgrades recently i was getting alerts for low funds after i had transferred cash happened over a weekend  i didnt even bother to send them a notice because i was confident it would be fixed soon amp it was i love chase,1really easy to use i can move from account to account easily deposit checks check balances and transfer funds had my kids accounts linked when they were younger great way to keep tabs on their spending and saving habits we were also easily able to transfer funds to my daughters account monthly while she was away at college by setting up an auto transfer and paid my sons allowance this way when he was in hs that way we knew he was putting money into savings its a great app,1i gave it only  stars because of the fact that it does not show balance drop offs if you cancel a payment or order it doesnt show that just the available balance  need a memory refresh sometimes as to what it was otherwise it works every single time as its supposed to yeah i know one should scroll down and see that charge but when something comes up it just needs a quick explain happy with app tho on all devices and love the text part too way easier when making a purchase and you need to know quick info thanks chase,1for a bank app its great has a wonderful look and a lot of nice features i was very happy to see the quick look on my accounts without having to log in but with the awesome addition of touch id i dont even have to use it anymoreid love to see more easy to get to transactional buttons and stuff like that right now if i want to transfer from my checking to my savings i have to press the transfer button on my savings then change the preselected savings account to my checking as the fromaccount not a biggie just something im sure could be improved id also like more details eg tell me more about transactions i made if possible also the quick pay and transfer ui could be improved  its falling short compared to the rest of the app it feels rather undersigned with a lot of info crammed in using plain textagain though great app,1i have honestly never had a problem with this app i suspect it has a bad rating because most users who dont experience any problems also dont bother writing a review ive used the app on multiple iphones and software versions and have never ever had a problem occasionally there are access limitations due to maintenance but you should expect that with any highsecurity online service i pay bills check balances check statements and find atms and branches very easily with this app its simplicity makes it very easy to use,1i two different banking apps and iv had more trouble logging on with this one if you try to log in and you dont have service for the moment or you drop your wifi for any reason their is no option the exit back to the original log in page from the loading screen you will just be stuck with the page loading forever not able to touch anything and the only way to reset the app is the delete it and reload it this is most frustrating as with my other banking app if i decide mid log in that i cant or dont need to check my account i can hot the back button and it stops  logging on,1my review wouldnt post wish i copied it b submitting the first time but i learned so this is my rd attempt it said i needed to own the app which i do so hopefully it works this timeanyway the mobile app as a default should allow the chase user to transfer  from one account to another bankcredit union after many attempts of enabling it it still fails and chase still hasnt assisted me i guess ill need to go paleo jurassic and actually physically walk into the bank to have this concern of mine addressed very inconvenient to use my laptop for transfers and especially if i have to go to a chase bank plz update that portion if the app thx for reading my feedback,1well its a replacement interface for their soso mobile web ui not much else its a bit more convenient than a browser bookmark i suppose and the overall interaction experience is pleasant and smooth needs a way to opt in to a simple pin unlock for less friction between being at my home screen and looking at my account if its good enough for simple its certainly good enough for thistook off some stars because pending transactions still arent reflected in my credit cards balance not sure if this is just the result of lax design requirements or an active ploy by chase to nudge more people over their limits in order to rack up fees,0the app is terrible seriously never works there are always glitches and it will just close out when all i use it for is to check balance  for the past two weeks it wont even open i will type in password and it says something about sorry we cant access your information on this device log in on your computer   so when i get on a computer to log on  it shows none of my account information only the bill pay where you can send or receive moneyits also frustrating any time i try to log on to my account from somewhere it wont let me on even with my password until i get a confirmation call by call or text to verify its me  when i lost my phone it was impossible for me to get to my account,1i definitely use this app a lot to check my accounts on the fly in addition i like using it to quickly transfer funds when i need to  i would like more automation and maybe some bill payment updates  i think also adding voice functionality for certain such as integrating with siri to ask  hey siri what is my chase account balances you can have siri use an authentication method so the program can fetch your balances without having to open the app with all that said keep up the great work chase,1all things considered its not a bad app however im using it only to pay a bill due to chase and accessing the bill pay feature is just a little inconvenientbesides that ive forgotten a payment on a couple of rare occassions and the app and mobile website locks me out it knows who i am but tells me i have no accounts that are set up to be mobileaccessible i must go to the desktop version of the site to make a payment that makes no sense and is most of the time not practical for me which makes me even later getting the bill paid because i generally dont have ready access to a computer,1i use this app daily would be lost without it very intuitive and easy to navigate really like the fingerprint enabled security disappointed that chase is behind the competition in regards to apple watch compatibility hope they catch up soon the worst part of this app is the alerts you get a badge showing that you have an alert but nothing to indicate which account or credit card the alert is on so you have to cycle through every single one before finding the alert with the most recent date hope they get that fixed otherwise its a great app,1i have been using the chase app since its beginning and have never had a problem i can be in line at the store and quickly do a transfer from one account into another to cover my debit card purchase i really love the touch id feature now that lets me log on so quickly and securely i use the mobile deposit check feature exclusively for the few checks that i get from time to time its rare if i walk into a branch of the bank more than once a year what a great time saver and handy app thank you chase  ,1great app however alerts handling could be better if you have alerts and several accounts there is no telling which account has the alert you have to visit each one individually better would be to show which accounts have alerts even better would be an overview alert page with alerts from all accounts i would report this to the developer but if you follow chases support link you just get a bunch of banking phone numbers and none look appropriate for app feedback,1the chase app is excellent when it comes to utilizing and reviewing your credit card activity and making payments i find that is it is a little less helpful with other accounts i have with chase such as a homeequity line of credit or an auto loan the features associated with the credit card are very nice and you can find out almost anything you need to know without ever calling them i would highly recommend using this app if you have any chase credit card,1the chase app has surely made life smoother when it comes to instant online banking  for example i log in with my thumb print check balances make transfers to other banks deposit checks by snapping pictures of them and sending uploaded images and so much more all instantly  it sure beats having to waste time by having to use several components like a computer a camera or scanner to take a pic of the check a car in case you want to drive to the bank the chase app is a time saver,0new version contains intrusive advertisingwhen viewing individual quickpay transactions you cannot back out to the transaction list you have to go all the way back to the pay amp transfer menu wait for quickpay to load then start over why cant you simply navigate back and forththe way quickpay transactions are structured is confusing when someone owes me money and i send a request their subsequent payment is not tied to the original request so that i can mark it off as complete instead the user is forced to manually reconcile every pair of transactions i also cant renew a request from the app when the recipient has waited so long that the request expires,1very easy to use ive never had any problems with this app all the things i need to do is always available i still balance my check the old fashion way and with this app im able to view my current transactions i set alerts for everything and i love that i always receive a text when my balance is low or when a purchase is made it really makes my banking experience a lot easier and knowing that my account is safe with all these features makes it even better,1i really like this app  no significant issues  the only two annoyances are that you cant check your fico score even though this is available from the web site  also having to login again for accessing some features instead of relying on touchid like most other banking appsfor users complaining about update methodology the apps icon tells when there are updates for any apps and these days you should always keep the update count at  given that many updates are for security reasons i never run into the update lockout feature,1happy cc customer  happy with the app now theyve fixed the things that i needed to be  or rather upgraded in the app now i can easily access pretty much my entire account without having to go to my main computer to view amp or change my account for things that should have been on the app before now most things are available on the app thanks chase for making my life more simple with upgrades totally recommend for simplicity amp reliability way to go chasebig thumbs up,1i love this app i wouldnt know how to manage my money and pay my bills if it wasnt for online banking i have three separate branches that i bank with and chase is by far the best in terms of mobile banking yes there are a few glitches that are annoying especially when the app closes out for no reason but overall it is a fantastic application to use and extremely userfriendly biggest drawback for me is that i cannot seem to locate how to set up my thumb scan to log in so i have to type in my password every time which is a hassle onthego,1this app is terrific so easy to use and i love the swipe to the left to check your balance without having to log in its also so easy to mobile deposit checks it takes all of  minutes to deposit a check all it takes  a couple of pictures of the check to deposit  the amount and verify the account numbers and your check is deposited saves me a lot of time from having to make a trip to the bank i highly recommend this app for all chase bank customers,1i use the app to manage both personal amp business checkingsavings accounts as well as a chase credit card  love the convenience of banking on the go that this app provides  you will not be able to use all the features available from your desktoplaptop but it gets the job done  the big drawback has been that after a recent update on my phone the touch id ceased to integrate into the login process  ive had to manually enter the password the last several times ive used the app  i adjust the settings amp save but it reverts to manual logging again every time very annoying,1i have  accounts through chase i like seeing them both on one screen tapping one and seeing all the details there amp being able to make a payment from that screen with this new update i have to view my accounts amp details then navigate through a couple other screens before i can make a payment and they make you schedule it whereas previously you could submit a sameday payment usually as long as it was before a certain time id like it back to one screen with all the action options id need accessible with a single tap,1first off most banks had to accept the tarp money regardless of whether they needed it or not so saying that we bailed them out is wrong second of all chase was one of the first banks to pay it back because they didnt need it but there was a minimum time they had to hold on to it before they paid it back and lastly a bank is a business i hate when people say ahh the bank is greedy all they want is money i dont hear you complaining when you buy a shirt from a department store thats  and it only took  to make,0i downloaded the app to check balance and make scheduled payments the payment screen does not work first cant change the amount as it preloads my blueprint amount and is not an editable field i am able to change the date which is good but when im ready to submit the button does not work the cancel works fine ive been trying for months downloaded an upgrade hoping that it was just a bug that would be addressed with the update but nope it is frustrating i am using on iphone s btw which may be a consideration it seems that is one of the most important screens to get right as far as ease of use and that it actually works the app does work on the ipad that we have nd gen been making my payments from there,0app wont load then i get a message that my phone isnt new enough would i like to download the most current usable app for my phone i say yes download most of the time it times out and doesnt download the older app which is what i was using in the first place if it does download then i get the message that my phone is too old an i have to update or cant use the app its just a vicious circle bottom line  i cant use it anymore it used to be handy to be able  to check balance or make a deposit it wasnt broken why fiddle around with it and update and try to fix it my advice to chase stick to old fashioned banking and service and try to get that right before you venture into high tech leave that to the nerds or the kids,0i actually think the chase app is pretty decent and easy to maneuver i would give it a  our of  stars but deducted one for the required update ive not faced any issues with the app until it does not allow me to use the app without updating to the newest version compatible with ios  i have the iphone s with ios  and im content with the system i do not want to have to update to  and im disappointed that i would be forced to if i want to use the chase app a lot of apps still function or allow you to download the most recent update compatible to your iosthis is making it inconvenient for me as i used the mobile app much more than having to log in on a laptop,1i appreciate an app with good user interface and this one has that  super clean looking app some features could be improved upon one such is notifications  often when the app has a badge icon there will be no notification when i open the app  also sometimes when there is an actual notification the badge icon will not clear when i exit the appfurthermore touch id is needed  chase is a pretty late adopter of this many other apps have had it for some time now and it would be a welcome addition to the app subtracting one star until they fix this,1update thanks love touch id deposits are working better all i want is check images and all will be perfectthe app looks good and is easy to understand and navigate its also been extremely reliable except for the photo check deposit which only works about half the time for me basically way better than the web interface lost a star for two omissionsno touch id and check images i suspect well get touch id soon dont know why no check images the regional bank we used to use had this feature in a much less polished app,1i pretty much use only one credit card i do it so i can keep an eye on credit card purchases for example last time i flew out of state at the airport my credit card number was taken within a day my credit cardnumber was used in person in another state i have never been toi used to watch my credit card purchases using the chase online site but now i use this app i used to have to check out my points on a different site but now all i need to look up is on this app,1finally we have touch id however chase apparently feels that biometrics are unreliable to show more than balances in the previous version when you selected a credit account you got an account summary current balance statement balance and payment info now that seems to be gone and all you get is a list of recent transactions you have to open a pdf of a print statement to see what you want to see and you have to authenticate with a password to do so if its a choice between having touch id and account at a glance i prefer the latter but would much prefer to have both,1i only have credit card accounts and for that its great i can see all the cards i have in one place check pending and posted purchases very efficientlythis is an update and i love the touch id to get into the app but i agree with the other reviewers that it is annoying to have to enter the password to see credit card statements it is also impossible to see when payment is due and whether or not i have already scheduled a payment it would be great if there was a flag that could be shown that a payment had been scheduled at the overall list level without having to click on the detail level,1it would be nice to be able to do things like dispute transactions open ach accounts etc basically every banks online features have one or two that stand out from the others capital one has a very cool easy to usesurely inaccurate credit score estimator and you can do disputes just by sliding you finger across a transaction wells fargo had a good brokerage account ui as long as you already know what your buyingselling and what priceb of a lets you open accounts on the fly if you ever needed toit would be nice if all banks would team up to make one ultimate online banking app with all the features,0for the past several months if i dont use the app for a period of a few days or dont log on online the app and website locks me out of my account your user id and password are inactive  i have to call their  number jump through hoops answer a bunch of security questions before they will allow me access again  then it will last for as long as i access the app or website on a regular basis  as soon as i dont access for a few days it makes me inactive again  horrible experience  you guys should take a security lesson from the bank of america app and people  ive never had any issues with their app or touch id with b of a  your it people and security people make this for an extremely unpleasant experience,0the idea of banking with a mobile app is awesome but the experience is a waste of time and waste of space i read the description for quick deposit and how long the money will actually appear in the balance i made my girlfriend download the app to deposit her check because she didnt have time to go to the bank she deposit the check at pm this was before pm guess what today is february th and the money doesnt appear into her balance right now its pm my girlfriend needed the money right away to take the metro to school and to buy food nope the money hasnt appeared chase needs to rephrase quick deposit to you will eventually get it deposit chase is garbage chase app is garbage you will see it the next business dayyeah right,1when i first heard of chase smartphone banking i was skeptical that it would be secure and two that it would be easy to use i must admit i was wrong on both counts so far security is not an issue as we havent heard of any smartphone banking security issues yet and secondly the app itself is designed to be mostly intuitive and in the few situations i didnt know how to proceed all the chase employees i have come in contact with have been able to help me navigate through the app when i needed it great app  stars to the app and to chase,1so recently i guess i was upgraded to the latest build of the chase app and well im having issues with trying to log in and i get a message indicating that my device isnt recognize and that i need to go through a verification process every time i log into the app then in hopes of escaping that craziness i tried turning in touch id which was disabled without my consent and when i login and turn it on and then log out and attempt to use it it disables touch id automatically and tells me i need to log in to turn it on wth chase did you offshore your development is no one testing your software anymore,0a year ago i gave this app  stars i used to click account to see my credit card info and it would list my transactions show me what i bought from where and how much i spent it would also list my payments similar to how the debit card account info shows up but now when i view my credit cards all it shows is a basic statement like what i owe when its due etc i can no longer see what was purchased and when terrible and now when i try and do quick pay the transaction says accepted on one screen the person did not accept it or even get a notification on another screen says funded and on my account summary it says pending what in the world im not happy i will change banks if this doesnt get fixed,1rereading my old review below i was surprised at how the features i use have improved i now point to chases mobile and desktop support as a main reason i bank thereeverything works for me now if theyd only send me the interest checks they told the irs that theyd sent me last october i could stop harassing my local branch manager yrs agoso after spending about two hours trying to figure out the problem myself and talking to the people at chase on the phone i found that the green change button in the payee area does absolutely nothing not only that but the chase representative on the phone also has a change button that does absolutely nothing after going through all the authentication questions and procedureslooks like they need to hire a new batch of programmers this was once a great app,0i got this app because i have a few chase credit card accounts this app is barely an app other than the main screen and sign on screen its pretty much like a browser page to their web site and it would only display one account not the  i have which i see when i got to the real web page i could not view any transactions it showed me one and that was it a few of the other things didnt work this thing needs a lot more work before it could be considered a real app i have the citi mobile application and thats a real app which works very nicely i use that for my banking accounts and it shows all my accounts but not for credit cards im going to delete this app from my iphone,1its not bad to check your account balances however unlike going online on a computer you cannot see the canceled check it shows the check number but not always who the check was made out to the worst part is the new quickdeposit feature where you photograph your checks it didnt work no matter how many times i photographed the check even though the lighting was good the clarity of the picture was good and the background was black very frustrating from what i have read from others they are experiencing the same frustration nice concept but poor execution fix the quickdeposit feature and i would rate it  stars,1i like the convenience of having access to my bank info on the go the app is very intuitive and works seemlessly when banking online and even when depositing checks right from my living room one thing i would like them to add in the next update is the blueprint feature that is already online sometimes i just want to track certain expenses on the fly and having to be able to do that only on the computer is not necessarily the most convenient so with blueprint i think the app will be even more awesome,1this app has never given me problems before and after the update it has always been easy and quick to log in check balances transfer money between accounts pay bills use chase quick pay and log out i absolutely love this app ps wats up with all these bad reviews one person gave it a  cuz he didnt want to update during his dinner another  cuz he didnt like the font but otherwise its perfect  a  cuz he couldnt log in with wifi  and another  cuz he didnt like the app icon  cmon people,1i love being able to check my accounts make mobile deposits and perform transfers and bill payments by using the app however im greatly annoyed by the fact mine doesnt reset its notification count so each month when i have a new statement it adds to the history of them and my red notification bubble prompts me i have  notifications next month it will be  in an effort to stop this i have to delete and reinstall the app but the count will start again not sure if this is an app or phone issue but id appreciate it being fixed,1ive banked with chase for a long time and i use this app on a daily basis but theres problems the app itself is out of date i lacks the new features that ios  offer and some of the security features of the iphone s and up for example touch id and the notification center you should be able to log into your accounts with your finger or your password also you should be able to view key information about your accounts ex money in account i give the app only  stars because for such a big company and the fact that customer service is first priority for chase the app should be updated already,1i love this app because i can deposit checks on it so easily but this new update is not working very well for that the pictures are offcenter and it took me  to  times to get a check to deposit the pictures were clear and i thought i would have to go to a bank  the horror  it finally worked after too many tries in my opinion please fix wow i wrote this review several weeks ago and still having trouble with the deposit feature how can they not have fixed this by now i have to take pictures in a special way to make sure they go through takes a couple tries still,1i rarely step inside a physical branch anymore i can transfer between my checking and savings instantly set up automatic monthly transfers to my savings great way to build up a cushion for those unexpected issues that pop up lots of other neat features too my only complaint only issue i have is sometimes when im trying to deposit checks on the mobile app even checks under the limit sometimes will not be accepted also new payroll checks seem to cause it to error and not accept if that issue with mobile deposit was fixed id gladly give  stars,1i use this app more than i ever thought i have access to all my accounts and can easily transfer money to and from each account what i also love about it is that i can use quick pay from the app i use it every week to pay my babysitter when looking at my accounts i can even see the actual checks ive written the only con when using the deposit feature it takes about three days to process i like instant when depositing thats the only reason i go to a branch anymore,1i really like the ability to deposit checks as a business owner this comes in handy and is very convenient i also like the ability to send money using the quick pay feature when sending money you can choose which account to send from however when someone sends you money you cant choose which account to deposit it into it only deposits into the default account if you want to deposit into a different account you have to change the default account on the web site it cant be done through the app,1easy to use and updates live thats what its intended to do right i do a lot of my balancing via the app on my mobile phone and rarely use it on the desktop i dont need to because everything i need is visible i can pay bills transfer funds within all my account deposit checks pay or receive monies from others via quick pay and etc i really like the ease of this app also the last update appeared to correct some of the issues i experienced which made it even better,1navigation is simple enough and the app offers most transaction options desired  one improvement would be alerts maintaining an indicator of which account is alerting me and why after ive gone to the alert area on the app i have to open each one and guess which is alerting me ultimately turned off all alerts to avoid the hassle but would use this option more if it worked better  i appreciate the message center where i can reach a representative on my own time and not have to call while traveling in europe regularly finding a place and time to call my bank is the last thing i want to do,1this is the most important safe and effective way to get your banking done easily and quickly it also offers added security features that are important especially when it comes to the safety and security of our money there other easy to use features and that takes care of all of your banking needs all in one place i encourage everyone to see and download this application it may change the way you handle your business and financial services,1very easy to use and navigate while in the app  never really had any issues making payments or checking my account status especially nice if you have more than one account with chase  you can easily view snapshot summaries of all accounts or select a specific account to view transaction details and payment history  i have an iphone  and the app runs smoothly and you can even view full statements in pdf from the app  highly recommend to anyone who has a chase account,1i like chase bank and have no complaints about banking with them the only problem with the app is when you try to access your secure messages it doesnt always load it chooses when it wants to load which causes problems when im trying to see the money sentrequested in order for me to view my messages i have to log in using a computer an inconvenience everything else is working fine and i have had no problems logging in or having it kick me out i would recommend chase bank and the app despite the issue im having,1i downloaded this app and was not disappointed touch id works well but like other apps passwords must be used after a phone restart which is probably an iphone behaviorallows me to perform many banking functions and verify activity on all my chase accountsi wish the alerts would default to the account with activity or at least let me choose the display order it always seems to default to an account that doesnt have any alerts other than that this has been a useful app for me,1not sure what id do without it it keeps me in line lol one nicetohave that id add if i was the developer is a variable called next billing cycle this would be used by people who pay their balances off every month the variable would  current balance  last statement + pending transactions that way people who have self imposed spending limits can easily monitor where they are at on their next visa  every time i use this app i make that calculation wish it would happen automagically other than that it works beautifullythanks for adding the pending items total that helps,1there have been a lot of changes for this app since its first release all of the changes have been for the better bumps along the way and now the app works great they have added a lot of features that were needed and like most people say going into the branch is practically a thing of the past i can do  of everything i need directly from the app i also really appreciate how this app takes security seriously by requiring multiple logins thanks for wonderful service and a great app,1i love love love this app it has so many features and options that my other banking app doesnt have i love being a chase customer chase bank in general has so many features i love that they have  customer phone service the online banking is great i love chase quick pay i love the fact that you can make deposits at chase atms and that the cut off time to cover an overdraft fee is until pm est time that same business day chase is the best bank ever thanks chase for making a great app and for having so many different ways to make banking easy,1been happy with this app  its pretty easy to use has a lot of features  biggest plus is paying for you credit card if you have both checking and credit accounts its easy to transfer funds within your accounts bummer that they got rid of the account preview before you sign in and i couldnt find routing numbers to my bank or my account numbers when i was trying to set up auto pay at work  but they are easy enough to get overall pretty solid though,1i give this app  stars easily utilizes fingerprint login no crashes good layout why  not  primarily an issue with alerts within the app you have to dig to get to the alerts section to resetclear alerts which aggravates me second is often times secure messages wont clear or cant be read in the first place so thats the primary reason for  not  other reason is minor at login it prompts for a rating which also disables the fingerprint function knock this off please    otherwise  one of the better laid out apps available very functional and easy to use ,1 stars for a job well done the login timeout is annoying since my app is always running in the background on my mobile device rather than displaying a timeout message every time i go back to the app why not just restart the login process every time the app times out and force the user to log back in i dont need to know that ive been timed out i just want to log back in either through touch id or some method now i need to close out the message stating ive been timed out + relogin,1i use several apps for financial transactions and banking none are perfect there are no glaring issues and no outstanding features within the chase banking app the fingerprint recognition is nice but if it is secure enough to access my account then it should be secure enough to pay my account this banking app works the way all banking apps should work i particularly like they feature that shows me that i already have a card payment pending if i inadvertently try to pay my bill more than once,1this is the best mobile banking app and they are always working to try to improve it the alert system is my most treasured feature you get an alert immediately when a transaction is completed this makes it extremely easy to catch fraudulent activity on your accountwhat i would like to see added is the ability to set up recurring payments for chase quick pay and bill payments directly on the app right now that has to be done on the website,1so far the app has been easier to use than the online site i was trying to use the online site to enroll it was difficult to read on my iphone i dont have access to a computer amp eventually crashed i got the app amp it was a breeze to use im looking forward to the paperless billing amp its no problem for me to check every day as i keep track of all my usage of my other card online anyway if i have difficulties with the app i may change my rating but so far easybreezy,1its nothing too fancy but rather a simple way to check your balance and make online deposits it gets the job done and thats all that counts really theres never any issues and it alerts you right away or the current transactions being made it automatically keeps a record for you to examine of everything that is going in within your account if you have chase just download the app i run a construction company and i have  problems with this app,0i used to use touch id to login but almost everytime it would fail after  attempt and say too many login attempts please create a new password this happened probably  times before i decided to stop using touch id so instead i would type in my password every time which seemed to resolve the issue until today when i typed in my password it gave me the same prompt too many login attempts please create a new password after  attempt its extremely frustrating and annoying constantly having to change my password to something new it also wont let me use my past  passwords used so i have to create something new which makes it more likely for me to not remember it,1it works great for what it is it has been getting better over the last year or two but the fact that on the login page it is always pushing some type of advertisement or product or etc that is unreal annoying we already have  chase accounts dont need any more the alerts are pretty much garbage and a pain to even try to check also i only left the review as to see if they app would stop reminding me almost every day to leave a review maybe at least one thing will get better now,1this app is so easy to use its really the only thing i use to manage my money which horrifies my old school father i have all of my accounts and my credit card through chase and it takes seconds to transfer money to pay my credit card or to put into savings seriously its so fast and easy the only thing that would make it better would be like if chase put  in my account every time i logged in think about adding that feature please guys,0love the ideas presented in this app but when i went to make a deposit after logging in entering the account entering the amount and photographing the front amp back i was then given the message were having trouble to connect to chase at this time please try again later then i discovered that the app doesnt save the deposit you have to start over and try again only to get the same message i called chase and they confirmed that they were having problems with the deposit feature and yes one must go through this frustrating ritual all over just to find out whether their system was up mmmm maybe its quicker to go to the bank,1im not sure why some people are saying they are having problems with the deposit feature  it worked fine for me on my first try  im using an iphone   so perhaps it works better with the higher resolution camera  my only complaint is that it did take longer for the check to actually post to my account  usually i deposit checks at an atm and they post the next day  with this it took  days  after it posted i was able to view the image of my check on the website and you really could not tell it was taken with a camera,0the one feature i really liked depositing checks by phone has been made useless by the new online terms of service agreement for mobile deposits here is the new verbagefederal reserve board regulation cc availability of funds does not apply when you send us images of your electronic checks generally you will be able to withdraw funds by the second business day after you make a deposit however we may delay access to your funds based on factors we determined in our sole discretionwe may return or refuse to accept all or any part of a chase quickdeposit transaction at anytime we are not liable if this would cause outstanding checks or other debits to your account not to be honored and returnedbasically they could refuse the deposit for whatever reason they want at a later date and withhold themselves from any liability still a decent app for chase account holders but dont even consider using the quickdeposit function you never know what failures on chases end may affect your deposits,0this app is generally easy to use it has the basic features of a mobile banking app however there is one huge flaw with it every time i want to deposit a check using mobile deposit the app will shut down i have to open it enter my password again and go through all the steps which arent that many but when you have to do it over and over again can be seriously aggravating and try to deposit the check again it may close three or four times before i successfully make a deposit ive never had the problem of the checks not depositing so its effectivewhen it works,1has to be one of the best bank apps around i love that i can check my balances and activities on all my chase accounts from this app i love that i can move money between my checking savings and credit cards from the app i also love chase pay which allows me to send money directly into someone elses bank account straight from the appthe other person doesnt even have to bank at chase its awesome i send my parents money this way all the time because i hardly ever have cash,1i absolutely love this app it updates almost immediately after swiping your debit card they always let you know in advance of any down time due to maintenance and it is very user friendly this app offers so many different tools to keep you in the know of where your money is and where it is going what i love the most is paying bills is just a click away instead of licking a stamp and hoping it doesnt get lost in the mail i would most definitely recommend this app to anyone and everyone,0i am a longstanding chase customer and have used the mobile banking app since it was available ever since the last update i can now no longer do mobile deposits i do all my banking for my business with out walking into the bank to be frank i hate going to the bank its like doing laundry i have tried complaining called reinstall restart delete and start again yet for the last two months i have had to go to a branch so inconvenient so disappointed just make it right chase just make it right oh and the message center has no use just freaking email me the msg rather than email me that i have a msg that i then can not open or respond to,1mugslymegzthere arent enough words to describe the awesomeness of being an account holder wchase amp their mobile app ive been wthem since  and ive noticed this hidden perk of being a chase member wtheir app anytime i receive a text alert from chase that my account is overdrawn if i deposit the od amount back into my account asap chase does not add the od fee  but you have to deposit the amount before a certain time i call this hidden perk bc i never knew about this i figured it out on my own thank you jp morgan chase for this incognito perk of being wyour company along whaving your app ,1was so excited to see the addition of touch id to the app but to actually do anything like pay bills you have to then enter the password even if its the first thing you do after logging on with touch id not only does this completely render touch id as inconvenient it also lessens security because instead of using my fingerprint i have to type in the pw someone watching you cant copy your print but may be able to pick up on what my pw is the entire thing seems like someone who knows nothing about technology made this decision get with it chase,1the app is awesome has a lot of features that are awesome because now i dont have to go to the bank nearly as often the side menu is very useful and the fact that you can click on anything to see details about it is perfect and it takes seconds to set up features like chase quick pay which i love not to mention the app design is beautifulthe only thing i can complain about is that i cant click the message to show more info in chase quick pay i can only see the first line which is a problem thats why i gave it  stars,1chase was one of first banks to come out with a banking app and has continually refined it ive watched my other banks play catchup for the last  years one of the most useful amp convenient features being able to deposit checks from your home or car or starbucks that chase has had for at least  years was only recently added by one of my other banks the app is very intuitive features amp information very logically arranged they were ahead of the pack in offering it and are still ahead,1it works fine if youre making payments but i hate getting notifications that i have an alert but its not  i log in and its a secure message that i had to enter my password to view because i dont know what it is alert or secure message until i log in what i hate about that is that you cant view them on an iphone or ipad so if you have access to a computer at the time or remember it later you have to go to the website and repeat  the alerts works well but stop sending the secure message alerts if i cant even view them  irritating as you can probably tell i despise entering my dang password when its totally unnecessary two thumbs down,1i like being able to check my accounts mobile deposit has always worked for me never accidentally deposited a lion one suggestion increase the default size of the boxes that the routing and account numbers are displayed in for easier editing the app captures the numbers correctly but some checks ive encountered have the check number printed at the bottom and the app tends to pick it up it would be easier to place the cursor in the right place to delete the errant digits if the box was bigger,1ever since i signed up for online banking with chase ive been able to transfer money back and forth between my account and my sons hs checking account with ease while using the chase banking app what i really like about the app is that its easy to use and navigate through the preview of whats in your accounts i think is a really excellent feature further which each new update its like they just find new ways to make life easier go chase continue to rock out mobile app development team,1ive never used an app from a bank before but think the chase app is straight forward and it does what i wanted my bank app to do i appreciate the push notifications that let me know there was a deposit or when my account gets hit with a withdrawal from an autopay like my mortgage or mobile phone bill those push notifications help keep me alert to transactions i wouldnt be aware of unless i regularly checked my account which is something im not too good at  no complaints so far,1i love iti been with chase for several years now and i have no complaints store online and over the phone customer service is the bestcompare to some other big banks having the app is so convenient can give me atm locations faster than googleuse the quick payview transactions i love it my favorite feature of chase of their fraud alerts i get emails texts and calls as soon as something weird is going on and until theyve reached me the account is secure i love chase and this app is the best,0this is by the far the worst credit card app i have ever seen do some work on it please doesnt break down ur balance by monthly cycle doesnt shown ur credit limit doesnt compare ur current balance to ur credit limit to show money available rewards points is not user friendly its easier to do things on the website than the app its easier to call chase to take care of stuff than use the app the purpose of the app is to facilitate users my recommendations to this company chase setup a meeting with discover to see how they do their app everything u can do on the website on discover u can do in the app for example  request a new card report a card stolen freeze ur account and much more this chase app has nothing,0update i wrote this a while ago but the developers dont care why is it so hard to flash a message to update before we login so annoying to login and then be told you have to update  just make it known first its not hard guysthe app is fine and i use it for all of my banking but developers can you please fix so that we are informed an update is necessary before we login  so annoying to sign on and then be told sorryhave to update app before you do anything  i know it sounds petty but it makes me curse every time i get that windowafter i already went through the trouble of signing on with my long usernamepw big thumbs and tiny phone keyboard having to do it twice pisses me off just let us know before we try to sign on,1main current irritation you cant enter numbers as a deposit amount without the keypad jumping back out of numbermode at each digit entry absurd  earlier versions of this had very irritating failures of checkdeposit photos would over amp over tell users a perfectlyclearlooking pic wasnt acceptable etc  wasted time caused angry visits to branch offc etc recent version seems to do better but well see  too often the update process is a step backward hoping for consistent good function  plenty of times i was ready to close acct and leave,1mostly i find this app very reliable and useful i use it frequently in the past i had problems doing  deposits but that seems resolved lately i find that if you open the app and get the dialog urging you to write a review then it undermines touch login thats an aggravation if you dont feel line writing a review you have to close it and reopen to avoid typing your password i also find that alerts  are somewhat buried i see an alert count on my app icon so i go in to see whats up and then i have to click through  menus to find out what the alerts are,0someone told me this app works great on androids so maybe this is just an iphone issue its getting really annoying how the touch id stops working every  days for me and then at times this app will tell me that it doesnt recognize my phone even though my phone is the only device i use to check my balance do transfers etc so then it sends me texts with codes so i can input and have access to my account through the app this has happened about  times already and ive only had the app for like  weeks ive had other bank apps and they were way better than this i never leave reviews but this app has really gotten on my nerves hopefully the chase bank app people see into this soon,1i was a bit shocked seeing the low ratings for this app having had such a great experience with it myself i am only using it to monitor my chase sapphire credit card activity make payments on the card etc but for that limited use its definitely a  for me love the instant notifications for any credit card activity on my account plus the the ability to search my credit card transactions and make payments couldnt be easier,1love the way it shows your balances of all your accounts  if you have more than one and including credit cards if you have one with them checking your accounts have never been easier you can review the front and back of checks that have cleared i find the navigation site to be simple and user friendly appreciate the alerts as soon as your debit card is used no more surprises of where your money is going or went  simply said i love and enjoy this app,1chase should take its lead from userfriendly institutions like fidelity chases app is not elegant particularly under brokerage accounts you have to click in at least two times to find how a stock  did that day which makes trading a pain too all the app has is total gains and losses not daily movement unless you click away the check deposit feature is fine and well done but for seeing and handling portfolios its too difficult time to make it equal to its competitors for me its a reason that i do not transfer my entire portfolio to chase where there is great service but the app so clumsy is a barrier to entry please fix,0a couple times a month this app will tell me i need to log in to reenable my touch id but when i type in my password it says too many login attempts now i have to recite my ss and go get my wallet and type in my credit card number so i can reset my password which is a pain inandofitself because you are arent allowed to reuse passwords and im way past using passwords or variations of passwords i can remember this is way too much hassle just to check my account balances and i would have shrugged it off if it happened once or twice but it is becoming so frequent that i felt compelled to write a negative review allinall a great app when im not forced to reset my password,0a serious financial institution has succumbed to the millenials need for simple visualization of each account and transactions over its adult clients need for efficient information especially to check for hacking  so now instead of one line per event with  columns we have four lines outlined in a boxboth on their site and their app  i guess when your monthly transactions are very few you can love the changes furthermore it is no longer possible to see the image of the checkthen i guess in nod to blind seniors they have made the font so big that it limits the amount one can view on the screen  please return the site to a more efficient view  leave the app design for millenials,1the checks i receive for work are from arvest bank and because arvest lists the check number between the routing and account number on the micr line the mobile app is not reading the account number correctly and will not allow me to proceed with the deposit i recently moved to an area where there are no chase bank locations within a  hour radius so i have had to rely on mobile deposit up until now looks like im going to have to close my chase accounts as they will be of no use to me now i like everything else about chase and their mobile app ,1touch id makes it quick and easy to sign in and i can literally do all my banking without leaving my house everything you need to know or be able to do is available on the mobile app how much money is in my account touch your finger to the screen and there you have the answer not enough transfer from one account to another deposit a check just take a quick pic  never glitchy always works and no unnecessary stuff just the options you want and need,0this is exactly the same as looking at the chase mobile version of the site in safari the only reason i downloaded the app is because the moble version of the site is very bulky and feels limiting either make an iphone interface or allow us to use the standard website while in safari ive looked for the use full site link such as you see when visiting facebook online but no go as for this app i give it two stars because it gets you the informaiton you need and generally does what it says but it is very basic and really needs to deliver something other than what is already available and i mean it is literally already available,1  it would be nice to see upon login a dashboard of the first  or more electronic payments schedule better if  pending payment showed on dashboard when looking out pending payments it would be great if it automatically sorts starting with the most recent sent date same requirement needed for online and ipad  when paying my chase freedom credit card using my app actually even online it does not immediately post it seems to take  hrs i would think since i bank at chase paying a chase credit card would update immediately it seems to take several days before chase freedom credit card transactions show up when i use my debit card as a visa it shows immediately why the delay when using my chase freedom card can the app be fixed to show credit card transaction immediatelyother than that the chase app is quite superior to its competition,1since i upgraded to the s every little alert i get in the app regardless of the delivery method  ie text email etc makes my entire alert history all the sudden go active again example  the app had no number flags a minute ago then i just got a text saying my deposit was posted last night and now i have  alerts on the upper corner of the app  happens every time when i go in and view the alerts it makes all of them read or inactive  then i get an alert and there are  new alerts again  no way to delete them either this is really annoying,1fyi i am in no way affiliated with chase and by no means get paid from them i wish this app works fine for people on the right operating system in the update chase did point out that some older operating systems would not work with the update i believe this is the reason why some of you are having problems so please stop giving it bad reviews its not chase fault they cant support old operating systems anymore thank i stand by my  star rating and chase was the st to ever add all these features give them a break thanks peace,1ive been using this app forever amp its been so convenient for me the chase quickpay is so amazingive tried the picture deposit before amp it didnt work but i live in nyc where theres a chase on every block amp almost every major drug store so i dont really need to use that feature but i can understand the convenience it would provide but other than that i get specific alerts almost immediately to my phone which is something i appreciate not sure why this app doesnt have at least  stars,1i love this app it has made my life so easy and convenient the push notifications for deposits and low limits make budgeting so easy the only thing i would change on the app is making the push alerts go away automatically when you look at your transaction history i dont like that i have to go through a couple of extra screens just to get rid of the red icon on my phone other than that this is absolutely one of the most useful user friendly apps on my phone thanks chase,1this is an excellent application  intuitive to use and easy to understand amp operate  even new users will not have any issues using this program to pay their bills  banking budgeting or just to purchase a product or service  it all just got much simpler  they say necessity is the mother of invention  this is definitely true as this application proves  brings credit management to an all time ease of usage  now if only apple care which supports all apple products was available  the world would be illuminated  thanks for the update,1i love this app and love banking with chase whenever i go to a physical location im treated very well despite my age  and always taken seriously and treated professionally this app is very easy to use and up to date with the current ios software its really easy to take pictures of checks and transfer money i cant move money from one account to another in less than  seconds and its instantly available to use on my card when i need to overall very good app and extremely easy to use,1work as a high school science teacher and tutor so my day starts at am and ends around pm this app is great to help me stay on top of my banking with the alerts when i get deposits or withdrawals i caught when my account got hacked right away because i got an alert the remote check deposit is also and excellent feature since with my hours it can be hard to squeak time out to get to the bank have only set foot in a branch once this whole year because this app is so convenient,1chase has it figured out one of the best banking mobile apps there is i wish my other finance institutions were more like this capabilities mirror that of the bank website ive literally had no need to check the site over the last couple months of owning this account primarily because i can do everything i need too frommy phone great app great bank no need to say more only reason not  stars is because fingerprint access doesnt allow me to have full access to the app i still need to plug in my password for full functionality otherwise great app,1ive been a long time chase bank user about  years now very pleased with service no complaints only one time was my card number hacked the process to be reimbursed was simple enough i got all my money back immediately which i really appreciated ironically this was after they forced me into a chip card which i actually hate but i guess all banks are now going chip no getting around that over all im highly satisfied with chase and would recommend to anyone can we please get a branch in versailles ky,1i absolutely love being able to see my account balance just by swiping right as soon as i open the app with out even logging into my account and i also love the fingerprint login feature it makes logging in so much faster than typing in your password every time my all time favorite feature of this app is chase quick pay being able to send or receive money in an instant is really cool over all this is an amazing app and i would recommend to everyone,1i use this app to monitor and pay my chase credit card so i cant comment on how it works for checking accounts overall its a good app and has most of my account details at my fingertips  the monthly statement is now visible from the app which is a huge improvement it was very easy to enroll my bank account for online payments i would like to see more intuitive navigation rather than clicking the screen for easter eggs to display the balance and credit limit remaining,1good app always works rarely shutdown for updates and always late at night easy to navigate and gets everything done i need it for transferring money paying bills checking balances between accounts finding an atm or branch locations when im on vacation extremely easy to see activity i love that i dont have to request a password every time i open the app on my phone unlike my pc because i delete cookies i have to verify my identity every single time this is so much easier,1i love this app i have been with chase many years formerly known as washington mutuali like the security of the site and especially online deposit online deposit is great and fast just follow the instruction and the picture of the check is easy this app makes it so easy and convenient right from your home i have not used bill pay but most of the other features i have used such as transfer money to an external account and monies to my children that they received the same day yeah for chase,1i do all my banking on this app until i got locked out cause of the extra security it wasnt easy to have online banking again dont like going into the some chase branches needs to learn manners im respectful to you then you need to show the same i have been to  different branches  will never go back and i told them did they care no  i will only go if in the area and  my favorite the most pleasant people there willing to help no matter what the best branch is at the corner of th and franklin rd,1despite having an account through chase im not a huge fan of big corporation banks this being said this is a phenomenal app that incorporates ease of use with high functionality and a slew of easttouse features statements are easy to read electronic deposits are quickefficient and paying off balances is a breeze heck the only thing preventing this app from being perfect would be the ability to withdraw cash remotely via phone but thats more of an iphone limitation than anything,0touch id has to be renewed all the time  have to enter a password to make a payment  the password reset has ridiculous number of requirements  its difficult to tell the entry fields because they are just text that you have to touch no box outlining the field  the password reset area has the first entry for the password and then a huge list of password requirements and below that is the second field to repeat the password and this is not easy to see and is very irritating when you type in the password and it keeps telling you that you dont have the requirements but its because you didnt see the other field for typing in the password twice,1this app is remarkably convenient and just awesome overall i highly recommend for anyone who wants to immediately see if they got paid know how much is in their checking or savings account or make easy transfers between the both of them i would only recommend one future installment and that would be to allow fingerprint access like all my other financial apps have once that is included this will literally be the best banking app out there thanks chase for making this so easy,1very helpful amp convenient  i use this app to check on my credit card transactions and to schedule my credit card payments  like that i can schedule payments in advance then just forget about it  like that i can ask to be notified of specific types of charges occurring online or by phone over a specific limit gas station charges international charges etc  this lets me know right away if my card is being used without my authorization,1when you are on the go it is easy to sign on with the touch id and then view accounts balances transactions make transfers and even view past statements loads fast and has a clean simple  interface even though most options are in there unfortunately you still need to click through more menus than you should the accounts are missing the key search feature which would really help other than that it is a great app that i have used for a couple of years now with no stability issues or conflicts,1there are many good features to this app i use it daily this app beats all the other bank apps for entering bill pay amounts requiring the entering of decimal points to enter exact amounts other banking apps dangerously avoid that functionality on the downside there is no fingerprint recognition feature for logging in all other bank apps wells merrill vanguard have it also i use multiple devices and often i get error messages that state that i have attempted to log in on a device that is unrecognized although i have used it for logging in many times before,0this app sometimes reports login failure  properly configured touch id could stop working for no reasonthe login error is not reported accurately  today i tried to login with touch id but the app reported login error  then i tried to login with password it reported login error as well  after trying it for half a dozen times i decided to use the password recovery feature  but it asked me for the card number  the information should be saved on my phone why does it ask me the known information  then i saw there are a few customer service numbers in the app  touch the number prompt me to call but the automatic calling feature does not work  this is an obvious bug  do you have a software qa to test the appi have to write down the number and then dial it manually  after reporting the issue to the friendly customer service rep i was told that cause of my login failure was my locked account  but the app never displays any information regarding my locked accounti wish the app can be designed more user friendly,1after fighting with the everannoying password monster a friend at the apple store mentioned that he used the touch id with chase im so sick of being told to change a password only to have it rejected or not recognized rob at west linn was very helpful in getting everything set up locks off old pw gone etc  now i just tap my finger on the button and im in no one has told me to change my finger great another feature i really like is the quick pay feature to transfer  easily chase is especially good here takes about  minutes used the same at usbank and it took  days,0accessing accounts is fine but when i tried to deposit a check it was hopeless i tried both on my ipad  and iphone s cleaned the camera lenses well rested and braced the phone or ipad on solid surfaces so there could be no movement  and finally gave up after a couple dozen tries the error messages said the photos were not sharp enough it didnt say that till both photos were saved so theres no way to know which photos were the problem i have a lot of photographic experience so taking sharp photos is not new to me but i have no idea how to fix the problem short of having an hour drive to go to the bank very frustrating,1chases mobile app is very helpful and userfriendly one suggestion is to make it possible to schedule change and delete automatic repeating payments long ago i scheduled most of my credit card bills to be paid  automatically but i have to go back to my laptop to make any changes except for adding a separate additional payment   another suggestion would be to make it easier to add management of credit cards from other companies to the app thank you for a very useful and easytouse app,1i dont write too many reviews but i use this app on a regular basis i like being able to pay bills from my phone love the ability to deposit checks without having to go to a branch really love the apps that allow me to log on with touch id so i dont have to always remember passwords  only thing i would like better is to see a little more detail on transactions would be great if you could click on one and see the details otherwise really love it simple and straightforward,1i use this app quite a few times a month  i pay bills with it and deposit checks  if you dont have a steady hand and good light it wont take a good enough picture to process  so keep that in mind  it isnt necessarily the apps fault it cant read your check  sometimes i have to do it twice to go through  so what if it takes a few tries that is one less trip i have to make with  little ones in tow  i think you cant deposit more than day with that feature,1i have had this app for over a year and use it on a daily basis  it is incredibly handy to be able to do my banking on the gocant say enough good things about it  until now  the most recent update has the app sending push notifications showing that my account is overdrawn by a couple hundred bucks  which it isnt  but it still makes me panic and check the balance over and over again  at least it still does that right  please fix,0the app has always worked fine for me but the design is a horrorshow  why does each transaction take up  lines why does it say other after every transaction what is the point of the memo description field if it always says na why do i need to see a long transaction number for each transaction why cant i see where one statement ends and the next begins in the list of transactions real estate on any smartphone screen is limited and there is so much waste here as far as banking apps go the amex one is definitely the gold standard but even the bofa one is much better than this hoping for improvements soon as the design hasnt changed in several years,1for about  months my mother and i were without a car due to an accident we run an inhome business and usually get checks rather than cash or credit we were exhausted by having to make a long bike or walking trip over to the bank to deposit the checks until we got this appthe easy deposit feature is the best we can deposit as many checks as we want quickly safely and securely i dont know what we would have done without this app so thank you so much chase bank,0do you check with your customers what they like before changing it doesnt look like it  the previous blue color scheme was much nicer and contrasted better with selection buttons the large logo on logon screen and background watermarks on other screens are gone i would think branding and recognition would be important come on  a bright white background what app designers did you hire to come up with that i prefer the older layout and this new one really stinks visually  seems like the account history takes up more space than before and more scrolling is necessary  also i dont like being forced to update the app in order to keep using it,1the app itself is ok ive never had any problems i mean all it has to do is show you your balance not that complicated when are we going to get fingerprint access though its been a long time all my other financial apps have it at this point even the small ones so why doesnt chase it makes me not ever want to log in to the app because i have to type in my password and im so used to just getting fingerprint access get it together chase i know youre bloody making enough money and im sure the worst dev on earth could integrate it,1i been with chase the past  year and i wont change it to any other bank again i love the service the app my credit card  n my car loan now are with them the best thing is i havent over draft ever again cuz chase with the push alerts or email they let you know ahead of time i love it never ever again i had to paid over  service fee like those other banks they looking one way or an other to charge you penalty only because you forgot for one day to deposit some money,1its like having the bank teller in the palm of hands  it literally does everything but dispense cash i can deposit checks transfer money between account and all my chase accounts are shown on the home screen you can pay any bill and send money via quick pay all with a few taps i check the app daily fast and easy not sure why the one star reviews ive never had a problem with operation i highly recommend for anyone living in the st century,1i use this everyday its an easy to use app and i absolutely love that you can customize the alerts to suit your needs about a year ago my banking card was compromised because i had the alerts set i was able to call my bank within seconds of the false transaction had i not had the alerts set i would have lost  to someone fraudulently buying basketball tickets with my card number yeah i love this app im giving it four stars because the only thing i dislike is the location finder its a little janky everything else is fantastic,0the app works great and is quite fast but there is no way to see the details of each transaction such as merchant category also there is no way to tell which transactions are recent activity vs transactions on my recent statement and it doesnt give a total for the amount that you spent for a specific time period which is quite odd because all my other credit card apps will give me this information the transactions remind me of twitter or facebook it just continually scrolls it is not separated by statement or anything i like the fact that i can now download statements but id also like to be able to activate my  quarterly cashback right from the app,0obviously my iphone is too old to use the app since i cant upload ios  i am sorry but my smart phone is still working so i dont see why i should buy a new phone just to be able to use the chase app this is a shame we should be at least able to use the previous version i was using this app several times a day and now i must browse on internet to find the website which is not really practical for cell phones i didnt know that using the chase app meant being rich enough to buy new cell phones at each update does chase have a deal with apple or what i am very upset because i think that an app should be available for anyone having a smart phone isnt it a part of the chase service after all,1this app has all the basics ease of use functionality good ui my only issue is in two areas both relating to password protection the app allows for touch id in order to access information but if i want to make a payment i have to enter my passwordreally reading my fingerprint is far more secure then the simple password the app allows that brings me to my second issue you need to allow for complex special characters if im not mistaken the app doesnt allow for special characters at all this day and age passwords need to be more complex then alphanumeric fix those things and i will increase my rating,1i like how easy it is to view my account on my phone when i changed my phone it didnt recognize my new mobile phone so i couldnt log on to my account until i verified information i love chase bank and their customer service is wonderful a few times i have tried to make online purchases from overseas and my card was declined im glad it was because theyre looking out for their customers they call immediately to verify no complaints only compliments yay chase thank you ,1i have bank accounts with  different institutions banks and credit unionsnational and local this app is the best by far  favorites include remote depositing of checks ability to transfer funds to external accounts via app the instant updating of balances and text messages as soon as transactions hit literally within  seconds of swiping the card at the checkout stand the only downsidethey need to bring back touch id login its a key feature and its missing  chase was first as usual then amex and us bank caught up now they have it and chase doesnt,1i love being able to deposit checks with relative ease since i dont have a chase within  miles of my house i like being able to peek at my balances without logging in i am pleased that the alert now tells me the amount of my automatic deposits saves another log in on payday i wish instead of sending me a message that i accepted a quick pay transferdeposit it sent it to the sender another chase customer that i had accepted it i know i accepted it they dont and i have to notify them it was received i also dont need it in my message center as well as an email if my action is required to accept it redundancy can be nice in some things like bill reminders but not for this action let me choose which email ormessage center or none that i want i have confirmation of the transaction in my online statementif i move a message to a folder out of my inbox dont delete it i moved it for a reason,1i forgot my password and the password that was saved in my safari keychain didnt work so i tried to create a new password this was arduous and frustrating because when i clicked create new password every password i created was rejected with a boilerplate message restating the basic password formatting rules finally i realized that the passwords were ok but in the fine greyed out print farther down the page there was a line to reenter the new passwordit would be more convenient if the app used fingerprint id as many other financial apps do another inconvenience is that the app and the desktop site have different passwords once inside the app is well laid out and has all the info i want to see for example i can choose to see my credit card activity or my mortgage loan in one continuous scroll it shows the past  months of payments and how much went toward principle and how much to interest,1chase always has the best and most modern technology its a great app i wish there could be less messages in my message center i dont need an activity log of sorts when i get emails about everything i also list the ability to use touch id to log on can figure out how to get it back pretty frustrating great app otherwise if you have a chase account or credit card this is a no brainer too easy to pay credit cards send and receive quickpay and deposit checks,0i just recently changed banks still keeping my chase accounts  and i had the experience of using bank of americas mobile app i wasnt expecting much because ive had bad experiences with bofa and only got an account with them because there no chase in some part of texas where i will be traveling too anyway their mobile app blows this chase app out of the water especially speed the app starts right away with no delay in idtouch however with chase i feel i could enter my password word faster or even go the bank stand in line and ask the teller what i need before your id touch comes up over chase you need to step up your game fire your developers and redesign your app because b of a is beating you by a longshot,1being a chase online banking customer for more than  years this app meets all my mobile banking needs the app is convenient secure and has a nice visual interface i like text transfers check deposits with my phone and the variety of alert options chase apparently takes our feedback seriously  years ago i was asked to provide feedback when i was unhappy with the app many improvements later this is now a mature convenient app i rarely go to a bank anymore,1why does this app make us login twice once to get in the app and then to make a payment i think its ridiculous to allow a fingerprint to log in and then have to put the password in to make a payment lets streamline it if you want to request another fingerprint to make a payment go with that but to require to put the password in to make a payment seems ridiculous if someones thinking security here i have no problem with someone breaking into my phone and making payment for me just saying not that they can access my phone because they dont have my fingerprint,0its great in that i can use my fingerprint to access my account on my iphone s  of the time  when it doesnt work i get a message saying cant connect to chase every other week my wife has tried on her phone when i get this message and she has access i have to delete and redownload the app which works  of the time for credit card with points i cant view points so theres that also whats kind of annoying is i cant see how much i have in total pending transactions on my credit card in case i want to pay it off early literally have to toggle between the calculator app and the chase app to get the total pending transactions,1i really enjoy using the app has improved a lot compared to when i first started using it a few years ago its very easy to login with my touch id as well as being able to get a quick glance at my balances without having to login all i have to do is swipe the screen its easy to be able to view your monthly statements you also get the ability of depositing checks with the app which makes it a lot easier than having to go waste time to get in line at the bank,1i pay all my bills with bill pay which keeps me organized and on budget i can deposit any check up to  with just a picturei opened a high school account for my son and pay him for grades and chores with a simple online transfer from my account to his i get notifications when my check is directly deposited i find i rarely have a need to go into the branch anymore which saves time and gas ive never had any problems since i started using this app  years ago,1its the way a banking app should be easy to manage and easy to use with a clean look and design the fact that i can quickly swipe right and view my balance without having to log in is probably my favorite feature of this app the touch id feature is a nice one too you can set up to have alerts notify you of account changesactivity so your always aware of whats going on with your accounts i highly recommend this app to anyone who banks with jp morgan chase,1ive been using this app for over two years i no longer getting in line at the lobby or at drive thru mobile deposit is so convenient and you can do it at anytime it seems like theyre only functioning better with all security features for their customers peace of mind i do like the recent update from the app which allows snapping the check on its front and back faster accurately the check verification process is getting speed up as well yes i love it,1i cant understand why so many people give this app bad reviews i dont have any of the issues they reference  for example logging in is simple id and password just like any other secure site check photos are accepted just fine the message center works fine and all account info is readily available app is easy to use and intuitive this is a great banking app and saves you the trouble of having to login from a computer ive never experienced any of the problems people are complaining about so dont assume thats the standard this app has worked flawlessly for me ever since i installed it can it use some improvements like easy clearing of notifications sure but thats not the main reason for using this app bottom line  if you bank with chase get this app  it definitely makes banking faster and more convenient,0this app used to be very useful and one of the better banking apps but for the last several months i can only use it twice before it gives me an error it says there have been too many attempts to enter my password and it locks it out so you have to go to the website to reset the password however the password reset site doesnt work on mobile either so i have to wait until im in front of a desktop an ipad doesnt work either to reset it all ive tried using touch id and also just manually pasting in the password but both options give me the same error its incredibly frustrating to use and is seriously making consider switching banks entirely,1i am not having any issues with the app   i would always want to use it in companion with the desktop app to meet all my banking needs   but no issues making payments sending money with chase quickpay  remote deposits are a breeze  transferring money is mindless i can walk out of a store sit in my car and usually see the transaction i just made posted to my account already   i have never used someone elses banking app so i cannot make comparisons  i like mine,1love the app and is super easy to use everything is working great ill five star if you can add a combined total on credit card amount owed posted + pending total combined would make paying easier with two credit cards i pay them off right away when i use them i have to keep switching back and forth from calculator back to app to add pending with posted for two cards and its annoying  other than that missing feature i love this app and thank you for not making me have to use a separate rewards app,1i dont usually use the chase app today when i tried to sign on to the chase web site it suggested that i install the app on my ipad while i was downloading the app i noticed that i could not use the chase web site on my app im not sure why when i started the app i learned that i could not use a widescreen view and that makes it difficult to use my keyboard for the few times that i use the app i dont recall any major problem buti prefer using the chase web page and wish it would work on my ipad the way it does not on my desktop,0i have banked with chase for several years and this application used to make it very easy to pay bills or send money to friends  over the past several months this application has failed to load and there have not been any updates to fix it  it always seems to say unable to open at this time try again later  i need the application now  not later  easily accessing my accounts is a key part to choosing a bank and the lack of updates to this application has allowed chase to fall behind other institutions its a shame to have to shop for a new bank because a huge company has allowed itself to be so inaccessible,1i came to chase bank when they took over the bank of new york in my midtwenties oh i loved the bank of new york  over the years banking has progressed and i feel chase has kept right along with technology i like their app and they modify to keep it simple for their customers  another great convenience from my start with chase was the abundance of branches everywhere  all customers have the right to review their vendors for services provided and i find that chase bank provides me outstanding banking services,1i love this app because i can do everyday simple transactions without the need of stopping at a branch such as viewing balance paying bills making transfer etc however most of the time im unable to use the app when im in a different wifi zone from my house or job its probably has to do with security but it is annoying and inconvenient because sometimes i want to bank when on the bus or vacations and i cant hope it can be fixed because other than that its a great app,0the big problem chase has with this mobile app and their web app is accounting for payments my payment posted yesterday and is listed in transactions but payment due date shows yesterday  pmt due i use autopay but often have to check to make sure the payment posted online it says if payment due date is a saturday the pmt will post friday yet friday night at pm theres no record of payment pending i called them but they would not acknowledge a problem i have a huge credit limit and a choice of multiple cards all of which i pay off monthly problems like this cause me to use another card instead of chase,1since i have changed banks and now use chase i have found this app to be extremely useful deposits transfers quick money is all very resourceful if i have any issues i can call directly and they can assistance me from the phone as well sometimes little quirks happen with the connection but for the most part i am pleased customer service is always impeccable on the phone or in person they are willing to assist and are extremely courteous i have not been to one chase branch location were they service has not been superb thanks chase,1amazing app elimates the need to ever go to the bank for  of my activity the  that is missing is that i cant withdraw cash and have it dispense from my phone lolhave my alerts set for any activity at all and when i was double charged by costco it showed up as two push alerts and text messages and there was my proof that they double processed my order they reversed it right then and there based on those alerts would have been a hassle otherwise love you chaseawesomecouldnt live without it,0although this application is extremely useful and convenient i am angered that i will no longer be able to use it seeing as i have the iphone g which no longer will support this app i find it saddening that chase bank finds it in their best interest to eliminate a portion of their market of users of this app and only because they do not have the newest and improved phone if it werent for this fact i would have given this app  stars but their ignorance to some peoples financial situations to those who currently cannot afford a new updated iphone is what led me to give this app a mere  stars thank you oh so much chase for no longer supporting the iphone g,1ive been using the mobile banking app for at least  years and have been waiting for improvements to the alerts area two gripes  navigating to the alerts area takes a lot of steps and alerts cant be removed until one goes there while like getting alerts ive set up such my balance going below a certain level that account is about th on the list of my accounts  when i open the alerts area im not able to tell which account had an alert and the defaulted first account is one i rarely use so id like to be able to arrange my accounts in the order best suited for my needs,1this is a fine app for making a quick check to see how much is in your account but it doesnt do that much more id be nice if you could see more detail about your accounts like whether or not a deposit has cleared and pending payments that might effect how much will be in the account by the end of the week and as far as depositing checks by taking a picture of the check goes its fine for small amounts but wont take bigger checks like rent checks or payments for contracting jobs or work you did on someones car or anything with a higher value than a few hundred bucks,1the only reason i ended up with a chase account was because of the outstanding customer service in the branch in which my mom had an account later i downloaded their app for sheer convenience we have since moved and i have opted to keep my chase account even though we live  hours from the nearest branch the app and online banking with chase continues to be an excellent experience the interface is intuitive and ive never encountered any difficulty in navigating a great one to have if you are a chase customer,1love love love how i can now swiperight to get a quick balance check on my accounts without having to login and tap around which is quite difficult and unadvisable while driving still have to login if i want to see detail but this new update is a huge benefit and time saveri also would like to give accolades to chase customer service and fraud prevention staff very helpful efficient and have saved me from unauthorized purchase many times my own faultwould give this app  stars if they would make some improvements to secure message center see other reviews,1i am in college and my parents local bank did not have a branch near my campus so i began researching and decided i either wanted to bank with chase or wells fargo because both offered good options for students and both had several convenient branch locations i decided on chase because i read reviews and liked their mobile app more as i love technology i could not be more pleased i deposit my checks from my phone and their app is very easy and pleasant to use for every day banking needs,1to preface  i switched to chase from crooks of oops bank of america after  years the original version of the bank was first texas then a few more incarnations before boa took over  anyhow chase was highly recommended so i reluctantly made the change thinking it cant possibly be that much better than boa i was wrongchase has been an exemplary bank and was the first bank to have online banking  each app improvementinnovation  implemented has made this app the ultimate in convenience managing your accounts are idiot proof,1i cant believe how many good ratings this app has do people have such low expectations that they think this app is really  stars or is chase paying people to write good reviews this app is reliable definitely but i must be missing something others see i think it has limited functionality and it makes me insane that i have to enter my password for so many things after ive set up touchid  specifically to make a payment on my credit card chase do you want to be paid or not if i already have my source account set up and dont want to change it let me make a payment without entering my password,1chase bank was already my favorite but this app has made life so much easier its updated regularly and i dont have problems with glitches or bugs except rarely when depositing checksspeaking of which you can log in with your fingerprint deposit checks with a picture which is a huge deal for someone like me who misplaces things easily i can almost never remember which purse or backpack the check is in and now i dont really have to another huge feature is the quickpay my mom sent me money often through quickpay while i was at college and it was a lifesaver for both of us it has also come in handy with everyday life i could go on and on but if you have chase and dont have this app youre doing it wrong if you dont have chase your app is probably watching and imitating every feature chase comes up with so good luck with that,1the app has been fine all along except for the past week where it doesnt allow me to sign in using touch id anymore it prompts me to change my settings within the app after i log on i have a very secure password so its a pain to type it in every time shortly after signing in i turn on the touch id in settings and log out next time i try to sign in it prompts me to turn on touch id in settings again ive done this several times but same thing at every log on ive deleted the app and re downloaded but it keeps doing the same thing please fix this bug touch id is a real time saver when im on the go,1everyone likes pieceofmind when using apps dealing with money and their finances  this app is just that really well thought out ui everything is so easy to use find and understand whether youre making a credit payment depositing a check or two and cant get to a branch or need to payshare money quickly the chase banking app has got you covered i have high standards for star ratings so this app is nothing short of exceptional for design and ease of use as well as convenience,1i check my account at least  times a week i like to make sure that all my transactions have been cleared and i can honestly tell you that this app is amazing ive never had a problem with it and its very easy to use i use to have a different app for a different bank and i just decided to delete it from my phone because it wasnt worth using it you will not experience this problem with the chase bank app its just an amazing app over all i highly recommended,1my comment would be one sided because ive only had chase since i graduated high school right now im in college and enjoy the no fee charge for being a college student one time i lost  during an atm transaction called chase customer service and told them what happened this was hours before my family and i went to florida for a vacation they gave me  credit while they did the investigation it turned out they couldnt find it but that was my fault they did their part theyre awesome,1i really like this app its great having such convenience at your fingertips transactions are always posted instantly giving you a very accurate available balance i love the ability to deposit a check by taking a picture i never have to go to a branch since i can do everything through my phone quickpay is fast and easy but the initial set up must be done on a desktoplaptop computer transferring funds between accounts is a breeze overall great app for all your banking needs,1this app is on my top  list of most used app and i am talking  about ranking it in my  odd pool of apps i am a heavy app downloader researching them over time while chase app stands out with its essentials features touch id also unlike other banking apps it doesnt supply you with data and features you hardly use in short chase has kept it precise just caution on the hidden current balance information which is exposed by clicking on the balance value or helpi icon can be confusingfrustrating sometimes,1we all love our chase app in my family the kids pay me for their cell phone bills with the quick pay feature as does my mother and fatherinlaw it makes life so much easier i run a business out of my home and i deposit all of my checks in flash with the snap of my camera i love that feature also  plus i can transfer money between mine and my husbands accounts easily with just a few taps i wouldnt bank anywhere else i just love my chase bank iphone app,0i recently switched banks from bank of america to chase and i have to say bofas app is much better not only is the user interface cleaner and easier on the eyes but the functionality of their app is better as well chase needs to add a feature so that you can easily search through transactions by typing a keyword also the bill pay feature is confusing and not user friendly again bofas interface is much cleaner and user friendly in bill pay menu additionally i should be able to schedule monthly payments for my chase credit card for whatever amount i want instead of the current choices of the minimum or the full balance,1i have not made a trip to my local or any chase branch in more than six yearsall because of this brilliant app photo depositing checks was the gamechanger the activity alert feature instantly let me know my account had been scanned prechip so i could place a stop on the card im able to effortlessly transfer funds to brokerage and other accounts i can access my monthly statements and an email is sent when its ready the app is more than i ever expected and it keeps getting better wow,1i have been an online customer for a long time and for the last few years i have only used the app for all my banking needs  i use it pay bills send money through quick pay check my balance pay my chase credit card and deposit checks  i dont use paper checks anymore as i dont see the need to use them  i have setup alerts to see when funds are spent so i can keep track of what i am being charged at all times  i love this app ,1i opened my chase account while living in brooklyn where theres a chase bank on almost every other corner banking was so easy and available when i moved to california i was lucky enough to have a chase bank close by but took more advantage of my mobile features such as online check deposits now i am in pennsylvania a couple hours away from any chase bank and am so grateful to my mobile app and online features to keep my banking easy to access and available,1im oldschool about my banking and i still balance my checking account monthly please enjoy a hearty laugh at my expense here so i was wary of the chase app but i do love it i transfer money check balances occasionally pay bills and even use it to deposit checks by taking pictures of said checks pretty fancy i would not enjoy giving it up it is super convenient and i appreciate everything it adds to my busy life and you know what i still balance my account monthly,1definitely an efficient app in regards to managing your finances their accurate push amp email alerts around the clock help me budget my money at all times amp allow me to know exactly what im doing with my funds the fingerprint feature makes logging in way more secure amp fast and the preview feature without even logging in is a plus too for when youre in a rush to make financial decisions i absolutely recommend this app for all chase users amp would present this layout to other banks to follow suit,1the chase app is awesome honestly i rarely have to go to the bank anymore since you can do everything from your phone my parents worry about fraud for online banking but for me its better because you can constantly see your transactions i had a fraudulent charge show up once on my account and chase took care of everything they were amazing i have another credit card app thats good but not as good as chase i not only recommend their app but banking with them as well,0such a shame for such a great great bank to have such a horrible app read the my review and all the reviews before mine and listen to your customers complaints  this is a sh_tty app flush it down the toilet and replace it with one that works i couldnt log in because of the too many attempts message even on my first attempt with the correct password i went to the branch three times and had it unlocked it worked for a couple of days then same problem recurred i ended up changing my password twice already and still not working again this defeated the purpose of quick and easy banking on the go its so frustrating please listen to your customers and replace this horrible app,1this app works great  all the reviews i read on this app want it to do everything the desktop can do it they dont realize that this is an app  the desktop site has more functionality for a reason security   this app is convenient and works well for its purpose  i have no complaints  works perfectly every time   gives the info i need lets me manage the bulk of what i need to do and has no glitches  complex stuff should be done on a secure computer anyways not on your phone,1ive been using the chase app for over two years and i love it i find it very efficient and easy to use i tend to avoid depositing checks on the mobile app just because im a bit various about potential glitches however i do a lot of transfers and bill pay stuff and the app is easy to use and navigate i love the quick view option to see my basic account info without having to login im very happy with the chase app and never had any problems with it i recommend it,1it gets better and better as time progresses so much ease of use i hardly login on a computer at all anymore thanks chasesome quick feedback as an update to my original review since enabling the touch id feature i find that it seldom prompts me to use it when first opening up the app after being logged off still love the app and give it five stars but this is a little frustrating however nitpicky hopefully other people have seen the issue so it gets fixed thank you,1overall the app gives you everything you need pretty easily you can get alerts from the daily balances you can get as much as you want or you can get as little as you wantthe only thing i would like to see is to have the ability to edit the checks as they appear on the online statement and i would like the capability to sort amounts high to low or low to high  the same thing goes with the payee being able to sort that in alphabetical order without having to export it would be a huge addition,1always uptodate information on transactions and paymentsdue dates virtually every aspect of an account at least mine anyway is accessible via this app i dont remember the last time i actually logged into the chase website to be honest because i exclusively use the app touch id makes signing in a breeze as well  no dealing with pins or passwords if youre not currently using this amp have a chase card i would highly recommend checking this app out,0i use this daily for my personal and business accounts i have to transfer money between my wifes account and several business and payroll accounts on a daily basis but have yet to be able to complete a single transfer after this update it has been about a week now and i have made several customer service calls in which they acknowledged a problem with the newest version but only offered the solution of deleting the app and reinstalling which i have done numerous times chase needs to fix this i like the new look and feel but is useless if we lose function or at least allow power users the option to revert back to the working version,1like the app overall but when you get any alert from the app it should follow standard behavior and show the active alerts as soon as the app is opened and the passcode is enteredinstead the alerts are hidden here more gt alerts gt alerts history i say hidden because the app shows a badge above the option more but no other badges or indicators so that you know which of the areas under more to look to explain why the badge is present id be much happier if below my list of accounts there was an alerts button that would take me directly to the active alerts for any of my accounts,0ive used this app for a while now basically to make payments on my chase credit card and to be made aware o hen theyre due  recently ive branched out and opened a chase quickpay account through which my employer pays me weekly  in the commercial on tv im seeing people on their mobile devices sending and receiving payments in one click yet every time i try to even login to my account via the app i get a message saying my account info cannot be displayed on a mobile device and that if i want to accept a payment i must login via a computer  this app is useless for quickpay so much for the commercial ugh extremely frustrating,1ive been using this app for almost  years now and the whole app as a whole is really convenient and successful being able to move money from one account to another accepting messages from accountants and depositing checks the review below has been reviewed and fixed the maximum amount allowed deposited does now appear below the amount entered section not entirely sure the criteria that makes the maximum amount other than that major bugs fixed and depositing a check is almost as easy as it is on the commercial,1chase has a great app for banking no doubt but with aging eyes cataracts the glare from the new app is unpleasant faded whitish colors really  i cant wait until that trend is over itself i dont doubt they added some great functionality to an already great app but i can tell you i cant see it from all the glare the functions i used before the latest update are all there maybe a bit less obvious to find but they are all there i might be going back to getting paper receipts at the atm something ive forgone since i started regular use of the app i just dont need the eye strain,0this app is nowhere near the level of quality or functionality youd expect from a bank this big there are many ridiculous design decisions where you can tell its a very small team of programmers working on this without a real usability background there are several screens with really stupid tiny buttons you have to manage to pinpoint  and then huge like ths of the screen blank below them im not even kidding tons of room for larger buttonsthe alerts management is atrociously bad for whats required to simply dismiss a notification red badge on the app and now they silently dropped ios  support thanks for nothing chase,1chase is by far the best app and i know because i closed four accounts i had with other major banks using their apps as well i can always see pending amp paidprocessed transactions immediately other bank apps some pending transactions were in limbo not seen amp that created problems being that most my household bills are on autopay the mobile deposit with chase app is the quickest ive used i would like for mobile deposit limits to be higher but its nothing i cant do without,1ive been a customer since before it was even chase and their service only got better after the merger their app is easy to navigate and is super user friendly for even the most inexperienced app user the only feedback i would give is to fix the time it takes when checking your secure messages its almost as if it freezes for a little before actually showing your messages other than that i couldnt be happier with my bank app,1but its still missing something when i receive an alert and go to the app to see where it is i am unable to it does not pin point the account the alert is referencing i have multiple accounts but the screen only lists one amp hides the rest i am forced to search and most times i just ignore it cause its a hassle so inconvenientother than that its great i dont have a chase bank location in my citystate so when i get to airports or other cities then i can access an atm or branch otherwise i use the local stores to withdraw money thats helpful,1i think this app is great ive had a paycard from my job as well as  bank both of which have apps too and neither are as simple as chases app i love the convenience of being able to swipe left at the log in screen to see how much money i have without logging in plus the simplicity of being able to use my thumb print to log in this app doesnt make it hard to find anything and it doesnt make things hard to understand thank you chase for being simple and user friendly,1i love the chase app which seems a little excessive for any app let alone an app for my banking but the chase app has honestly made my life so much easier for somebody who is constantly on the go and doesnt have a lot of time to stop at the bank or open mail it is perfection i can send rent to my roommate using chase quick pay i can deposit checks through the app and i can keep an eye on my account from anywhere and at any time i love this app and am so glad that i am a chase customer because of it,1i opened a chase business banking account  years ago while i was in the af and stationed in dayton oh i currently live in the dc area the closest chase branch is  hours away and i still do all of my banking at chase my business is small but chase has consistently been extra attentive when it comes to my business needs i like that i can deposit checks via the app and the drive to deposit cash doesnt bother me at all id probably drive  more hours just to get chases great customer service,1i pretty much use this app for just my checkingsavings accounts i dont really use it for my credit cards and i never use it for my closed credit cards it would be handy to delete those or even gave the ability to switch the order in which theyre listed most used on top least used to closed on the bottom  also its difficult to find secure messagesnotifications when i see a badge i have to search every account the badge should stay red and visible until i drill down to read the message,1i like convenience this app makes banking convenient depositing checks is the best feature i wish the check deposit limit was higher  seems like a good ceiling but i still have to go to the bank to deposit my paycheck not such a problem for most people but i only get paid once a month so my check is larger than that i also like the transfer feature my savings account is growing because it is so very easy to put money in it,1i think this app is great i can preview my account balance quickly the id touch feature is awesome and now we can even make transfers amp view checks on the phone hands down one of my most used apps because it is so user friendly only complaint twice a year for whatever reason and without warning the itouch feature turns off its hard for me to figure out how to turn it on again because im not tech savvy but once i stumble on getting it back its smooth sailing again,0this is a decent app that could be very good if they would simply fix the bugs often times when trying to make a payment ill get an error message stating unable to complete request sometimes this will happen  times in a row before it finally accepts the payment also you can log in to the account using your fingerprint but if you try to make a payment itll then make you log in using the password as if a password is more secure than a finger print lol these same bugs have been around for years and have gone unaddressed during that time so id be shocked if that changes now oh well one can hope,1i am very happy with the app however today they have notice that i can no longer send money using the app or online unless that person has an account with chase or some company they are dealing with as a middle man very disappointed now i have to use moneygram or western union to send money to family members or go to the bank and pull out the cash to repay my son when he buys car parts for me it is not my place to tell someone where they should bank just so i can use this feature i hope the come up with a better plan or middle man to work with,0its hard to convey just how awful and erratic the chase mobile banking platform can be every log in is like starting from scratch and requires an extra layer of verification with a password sent to your email this gets time consuming month after month and as many chase customers know by now the privilege of mobile check deposit the mosttouted feature of the app is unavailable for  months following an insufficient funds dip on your account chase banking sounds great but the reality falls short when you factor in the horrendous call center attitude impersonal and tepid and consumeradverse policies that make you to want to give up the chase as soon as you read the fine printthis is a no brainer,1my two favorite features of this app are the check deposit and the bill pay i pay my routine bills once a month at the computer but find the app bill pay feature very handy for the more random bills that come in what a breeze to flop down on the couch and pay a bill in less than a minute before i was a chase customer and used the check deposit i was notorious for holding onto checks for months at a time now its a matter of hours,1it works great if youre a chase customer youre so lucky its very simple and easy to use you can transfer money from account to account in seconds and it alerts you when something weird happens this app has been a lifesaver in very stressful moments and i couldnt rave more about it ive had first bank before and there is no comparison you can use quick pay and other tools on the go and it truly works amazing even when i have very little service keep it up chase,1the chase app is great ive been using it for as long as i can remember and ive never had an issue as of yet i love the fingerprint integration for iphone s very fast and convenient to check my accounts whenever i need depositing checks is very simple as well and always works great my job in pharma still hands out paper checks surprisingly but i still dont ever have to make a trip to the bank just quick deposit it on here every friday and im good to go for the weekend thanks chase,1excellent app overall especially great when you have both chase credit cards and bank accounts as you can easily manage payments between them easy to see how many rewards points you have love the touchid login only thing thats a little odd is having the log off button permanently in the upper right corner thats often the close button for popup windows so ive hit it accidentally a few times at the end of a transaction but on the whole really great,1ive had this app for about four years never had problem even when i got outside the country it doesnt fail me i love it its so easy to make payments very easy to transfer money theres nothing i would change about it i dont know how it give all these people a hard time i honestly think its just their phone because my whole family has this app and no one has a problem with it no one we all love it the only problem is i wish i could wake up with free money it haha,1ive been with chase bank for years when i visit them in person they make me feel like a vip so when the app came out i expected the same level of treatment they did not disappoint  checking balances making transfers depositing checks   all of this couldnt be easier ive talked to a number of close friends and family members who dont use chase but have similar apps for their bank  and they are not happy needless to say i always recommend they switch to chase bank,1i dont use the app for anything more than checking balances and transactions and transferring money for these purposes its been quite convenient if all i have to do is one of these three things ill use the app over opening the site in a browser on my pc if i want to do anything more than that though going to the site on a computer is much easier for example navigation is easierprobably because i know the nonmobile site better i havent experienced any problems when using the app for these purposes,1five stars     i like this app its very convenient whenever i have a question about a payment or my balance  its right here only thing i dont like  is im able to use my thumbprint  to open the app and i love  that because my password  is so long and complicated  thus the problem once im in the app if i want to do anything like write  this review i have to get out my book  of passwords  and enter it why cant i just use my thumbprint  as before other than that no complaints great app,1the app does what it needs to do i can check my balance and schedule payments and all that i havent experienced any bugs or serious problems i only have a couple of complaints the first is that touch id isnt supported all of my other banking apps support touch id for login which really helps streamline the experience and id love to see that feature added to the chase app the second is that you cant add an account to make payments through the app you have to log in through the website to add an account which can then be used to make payments in the app,0the app seems to work fine a little klugey but if you know what youre trying to do you can get it done major issues with access to information however the faqs have to be reviewed by scrolling through all of them and they lack information on paying on your account i guess my question was a little unusual as i had recently set up auto pay for my credit card account and my due date for payment is tomorrow and no payment had been deducted from my account so i decide to call chasebig issues  you can never talk to a person so if your question doesnt fit the automatons programmed info well youre out of luck the selection options are circular so everything you do to try to get to someone anyone fall on deaf electronic earsi never spent so much time and frustration trying to pay anyone before  i strongly recommend using another credit card company  my previous experience with discover and american express were stellar and make me want to switch back,1i dont know what id do without my chase mobile app  ive banked with many other banks over the past  yrs and no bank has had the great app chase has  technology is so important to me as i never go into a branch if i can help it  this app allows me to do almost all my banking which saves me time and money chase has put together all the key features in one place quick deposit quick pay bill payer funds transfer up to date account activity and so much more  go chase,0the app is ok when it works be aware that not all notifications will come through and when they do sometimes theyre hours and hours late whats worse is when the notifications are wrong i get incorrect notifications about my available balance frequently its easy to access and provides decent information about each chase account i just wish they could fix the technology i would like to have a bank that has a working mobile app but after being with chase for over a decade i will most likely just sit here and complain about the unreliability of the app and periodically check my account manually,0this app is ok if you just want to see your balance or your recent transactions but a big limitation of this app over what most other similar apps have is the ability to manage your autopay how is this not an option in the app common chase get it togetherand even if i do go on chases website to manage autopay guess what they failed there too the only  autopay options are to pay minimum payment or to pay full balance well if i dont want to do either but want to pay something in between each month im out of luck chase please take a lesson from citibank or discovers apps  who know what they are doing,1i had a check i needed to deposit in my bank but i was too lazy to drive to the bank so i tried chases quick deposit option on this chase app took picture of both side and insert the amount of  at first it didnt work and said error or something but after trying to take a picture again it worked so yes direct deposit worked for me i was using an iphone for those who are wondering what i am using to get it to work just try it a few times goodluck,1i can pay my chase credit card bill thru this app just fine which is great however i cant pay my mortgage thru the app it just tells me no accounts are available to pay it from i cant even pay it from the website because the stupid mobile interface they force you to use from the iphone wont let me nobody knows how to fix any of this i have to bust out the ol pc and pay the mortgage that way which is inconvenient when everything else can be done quickly wmy phone thru the app please fix thisits kinda important that i pay the mortgage ,1i absolutely love this app i can virtually do anything right from my phone whether im at home or outside somewhere i hardly ever need to go to the bank physically which is a definite plus this app allows you to do so much with just a few clicks of a button it allows me to check my balance check any transactions ive made transfer money to people pay bills and even allows me to deposits my checks the possibilities are endless with this app and it only continues to get better two thumbs up,1i love being able to move  from my account to my joint accounts with my kids anytime they call asking for money checking activity on credit cards paying credit cards depositing checks all are easy with the app the only suggestion id have for the developer is that it indicates an alert but wont tell you what the alert is would love to have that fixed but overall this app should make anyone want to switch banks to chase awesome,1the convenience of having all those banking options at your finger tips is great ive had the app from its beginnings from the very first versions and has come a very long way always has been a great banking branch even when it was washington mutual and the more the app develops the better the account management quick pay was one of the best things to happen to this app and now its new look although a lot more sophisticated the old look was in my opinion more formal but still a great app regardless of its appearance,1super easy and convenient to use way better than any other banking app ive used for other bank accounts plus chases customer service is phenomenal and the option to call and talk with a person number directly linked from more in app is really amazing ive recently moved to an area without any chase branches or atms and had thought about closing my account but the customer service and banking app is far superior to my other account with a different bank so im keeping it,0i have an iphone because i like the way iphone apps work  if i wanted to use apps with tiny and huge fonts dark backgrounds and a hidden menu on the left id be using a samsung galaxy  why does chase insist on hiding things and doing everything differently from the simple elegant apps that came with my phone  it just keeps getting worsealso the alerts notification issue has also been made worse with the new hidden menu it was annoying before but now its impossible to clear it unless you know where the feature is within the app the ability to clear alerts needs frontandcenter without having to hunt it down,1while it is great and allows to make variety of transactions from the palm of your hand and monitor your account as well as credit and debit cards it has a fault once you change the language of your phone from english where there is a decimal point to separate dollars from cents to a language where coma is used for the same purpose it wont let you enter cent amounts it simply doesnt work they need to fix that glitch would be also nice if it allowed touch id to log in,1hands down the best bank in general friendly and knowledgable staff all around anyhow im not here to rate the bank the app is always maintained organized and very customer oriented they offer a lot of options within the app and its just the best out of all bank related apps thanks to their constant updates i have never had an issue with it and they always make it better and better i have this app for almost  years now and never experienced anything bad with it i hope i helped,1i really like this app it is very intuitive for a person who is reasonably tech savvy the amount you can do once you understand where to look is wonderful the quick view is very helpful in making quick decisions wether something is in your budget i would recommend people give themselves  minutes to just explore the app and understand how things are laid out take note of the account transfers and quick pay functionalities and how to use them  great job overall,0why do i need to enter my password to do anything within the app when signing in with touch id major overkill that makes the app inconvenient to use my other banking apps that utilize touch id dont make me reenter my password for everythingglad to see check images in this update but again i have to enter my password before i can view themalso it used to show a picture of the city of detroit on the login page now it just has a yellow background and has detroit written out in text seems like a half baked updatefinally when logged into the main page of the app where you see your balances and accounts i used to be able to select where it says credit card xxxx and see a drop down of balance payment due date minimum payment etc right from the account list screen now to get that information i have to open up my credit card transactions screen and click the little i this should be available from the home page like it was i dont know why you added two extra steps to get that same information,1as a software developer i am not wowed by apps that pretty much do what you hope they would  but this is a solid app it doesnt disappoint often and as others have written you can do the key things  these are check balance see account activity transfer  quick pay deposit checks find an atm  i have business + personal accounts and discovered the business sign on is more functional for me i can also see personal accounts from there but not vice versa sign on is a pain as others said  give me fingerprint recognition,0i absolutely love banking with chase hands down the easiest bank to do business with however the app has several issues number one you have to sign in every time it doesnt incorporate touch id nor does it let you set a numeral passcode to get logged in it also wont remember your information so you have to type it every time i love the push notifications but if i clear them on my phone they still dont leave the app i have to manually go in and view alerts for them to go away it would be easier if i could just easily log in then they went away immediately after i looked at my balance screen thats my two cents,1i enjoy using this app for my bank account once every thursday when i get paid im knowing that the money from work goes straight to my account right and that nobody can heck into my account to try and take away my money i always enjoy checking on my money paying credit card bills easily and loving to transfer money as please without having to use the internet thank you people at chase for this app and glad youre doing your jobs right glad to be a good customer,1this app provides most of the key data i need and the information is available fairly easily from the home screen or even the login screen preview is a neat feature for a quick glance at my balancesthe overall user experience is disappointing though and it misses some easy wins  something as simple as a next button or arrows to move between the login and password fields would be welcome and are common on other apps  its also painful to clear notifications you have to navigate through a bunch of menus and its not obvious at all how to get to the proper screenthere are also some features missing here that are present in the web client  it would be nice to have travel notifications enabled through this app since i always seem to remember i need this right before departure time when my laptop is stowed away in an overhead binoverall the ability app has the essentials that i need but it has room for improvement,1i love the chase mobile app theyve thought of tons of things to make it easier for me to check my balance send and receive funds pay bills and simply search through my statements ive had chase for years but didnt realize how much further advanced their banking was until the last year when i opened a business and another account somewhere else between the three banks i use chase is the best and i cant wait to get all my accounts under one roof,1this is the best app out there someone stated that they couldnt access their business and personal accounts with touch id i login one time with touch id and have access to all of my personal as well as business accounts its so easy and i never have a problem depositing checks or accessing information however when you have an alert and try to access it you have to open all of your accounts to find it i have  personal share with elderly parents and children and one business otherwise i would give it a  rating,1never had a problem paying bills transferring money or depositing checks you get more detailed info on ipad than on iphone i find i have to use one for certain functions and the other for the rest ipad has more detailed info on credit and loans also can get much more info on investments ira on ipad both are good but i much prefer ipad love the fingerprint id love the auto logout cant delete messages great alerts i can get a message immediately when my credit card is used although i dont get them all  havent figured out why,1love this app  no complaints works loves  keep me in full control and up to date by the transaction for every transaction in and out the account u must set those in the settings for me i set to the lowest dollar amount so for example if the lowest dollar amount was  that is what i would set it to so any transaction over  i would get an alert also make sure u set it for both deposits and with drawls at the lowest setting everything is smooth sailing  you will appreciate this app trust me,1i have never had any problems with this app when i used to write actual checks i would often be overdrawn because i never balanced my checkbook now as soon as i get a bill in the mail i schedule the payment thru the app and let chase do the rest i can see what payments are coming up and see how much my balance is and know whether i need to transfer from savings to checking love all the alerts available as well i even pay my landlord using chase pay,1nice app so far for our mortgage and our other information re acct but havent used and make a payment online for mortgage due to being charged from other accounts and should of been  to use plus i would rather speak to someone because of another problem of posting on date that was days after my date i stated to post so i always ask for them to record call and if i am able i do with any questions on important issues so i rate highest for now,1this app works great except for the constant password issues its very inconvenient when it locks you out because it doesnt recognize your correct password ive even had them tell me on the phone that not only does my correct password not match their records but at the same time my correct business address home address and correct phone number do not match up with their records  they just wont admit when they are having technical problems and try to let you think its you putting in the wrong info password has to be reset several times a year so forget about memorizing it,1the chase app is great i love that i can use the fingerprint to login i love that i have access to all online features and i love the ease of transferring funds between accounts i gave the app only  stars because recently they did an update where you cant see a continuous stream of your credit card purchases now you can only see since the new statement started you can look up your last statement but that has just made it tedious i wish it would go back to the way it was or that there was a way to change that setting permanently,1i have been a faithful chase client for approximately five years because of their great customer service and their simple effective online banking  in particular i like chases iphone app  it is user friendly and convenient  i am able to use this app to verify my accounts status make a deposit view endorsed checks confirm electronically sent or received monies and wire money to my sons account  most importantly   i have never experienced any glitches or safety issues,1the app is awesome and so easy to use though if there was one thing i would ask to change is the touch id sign on option sometimes when i do the touch id to sign in ut doesnt recognize my finger then it goes away and has me manually type it in i wish there was a button on the sign in for use touch id cause i bank with stbank as well and the app has that option and its so handy especially when you are on the go but overall i love the app,0to access my chase account i was asked to enter my userpassword credentials expected  i then setup my touchid on the phone for conveniece this works great  now if you explicitly click on logoff the app should not allow the next person to simply sign in with a fingerprint  case in point i transferred my phone to a family member to be safe i clicked on logoff on this app and removed my fingerprint from the phone  the new owner of the phone was able to set up her own fingerprint on the phone and then just like that get into my chase account by only using touch id even if i had explicitly logged off   really   you guys should know better  use touchid for unlock not authentication,1ive used this app for several years and am pleased overall its user friendly and intuitive and i can do what i need to do however in the current version i have problems trying to transfer from the checking account to one specific savings account  it looks like the transaction is fine but when i press transfer nothing happens no difficulty with transfers to other accounts i deleted and reinstalled but problem persists works fine on the ipad,1this app has come a long way over the years i think that the developers have done a solid job of implementing all of the needed functionalities to perform many of the bank tasks that most be performed on a routine basis im not totally enamored with the messaging bit but its a trivial dislike to be honest i think its important to remember that chase is always one of the pioneers in introducing features into their mobile banking app and surly they most get credit for their ingenuity and risk taking great app in my opinion,1it works very well and does what its supposed to do i actually like using it better than going to chase with the browser on my laptop especially since they resigned the site the app is way more responsive and easy to use than the website i especially like being able to deposit checks from the app and no longer have to remember to stop at the bank to deposit them not sure what all the complainers who gave the app bad to mediocre reviews are talking about,1love your app except for one thing if i want to do a search for say payments made to a certain vendor as in a search for a particular pharmacy that i go to for months and years i cant do it that also applies to your website on my pc for example a monthly payment ive been making to this vendor twice a month for  years suddenly seemed to change but they told me im paying exactly what i paid every time i wanted to see all my transactions with them but i couldnt without scrolling through my entire statement inventory,1i love being able to deposit checks and transfer money to my son its very convenient and i also like being able to use touch id to get into my account the only drawback is sometimes touch id gets turned off after an update and then i try my password and if i am wrong  time then it locks me out and i have to reset it they should at least give you  tries like most other companies before it locks you out which is why i have trouble remembering my password because i have to change it so often,1i love this app works great easy to log in with the thumb print i love the features send money to other chase customers check balances and look at checks that been cashed no desktop needed and the best feature for me is the alerts i got an alert that my card had been charged  i was sitting at home called the bank immediately they canceled my card and disputed that charge thanks to the alert they werent able to charge anything else on it costumer service is great love this app,1i have never had problems with this app and i love the preview function i have accounts elsewhere and its so much more convenient than any other banking app ive usedsince i wrote my original review ive hade nothing but problems the account preview only works half the time it keeps telling me to login to view the account it kicks my password out about  out of every three login attempts even after i double check that ive input it correctly then i have to change my password  i have accounts at multiple banks and this is the only app i have problems with so i doubt its user error,1the coolest feature of chase mobile banking is unavailable to even the latest th gen ipod touch customers  i just confirmed with chase mobile banking tech support and a glitch the support agent couldnt give me a definite reasonwith check imaging prevents the check from being fully scanned  the chase support agent also said the check deposit feature is only compatible when the app is used on an iphone  is this an apple ipod touch issue or a chase app bug fix issue  either way this app is pointless for me since thats the only feature i was excited about,1i love the check deposit feature and all the alerts you can modify at any time however i would enjoy having the ability to modify personal information such as addresses and phone salso the ability to orderreorder checks via the app or mobile web portal neither of these locations allow for on the fly ordering due to personal time restraints and allow for this product to be ordered in more  methods since your phone teams for this service run during the day till  pm,1i love this bank and its app is the best banking app i have ever used however any version after  has been defective in many ways fortunately i had the  version in my itunes still so i restored it back to this version and all is great since i have been waiting for the corrective update but from what i read it appears that there is still issues i would say that while you are fixing the new versions maybe chase should put this old version up for download in the mean time so people can use the app in the version that workedthanks,0so for a great deal of time the app worked perfectly loved it i enjoyed not having to go to the bank to deposit checks and loved being able to transfer money to my friends and family however about  months ago the app wouldnt let me log on i would try and it kept giving me a message saying that they were working on correcting problems with the app unfortunately whatever problem that existed never got fixed and i still cant do anything on the app if im out and about i have to log on to the website from my phone which is seriously inconvenient with a small screen please fix this app so i can use it again,1the new app is much better than the old  the functionality is quite similar but the interface is refined and there are enough improvements in the flow to warrant praise  but fix the infernal alerts  its the dumbest thing  get a paper statement notification alert badge log in navigate to more huh  still not clear where it is  select the right account from the list you kind of just have to know which one or try one by one  argh  see the notification which is utterly useless  paper statement created  useless and annoying   wouldve gotten a fourth star if they fixed this,0the most recent update to the app has made everyone with an iphone s unable to deposit checks the use button is no longer a button anymore as it does not react to touch but rather it thinks im touching the entire picture and it zooms in as if the button werent there at all and their most recent update as of nov  fails to solve this problem im in the mountains of colorado and the closest chase bank is  miles away and their atms in my area cant deposit checks i literally have only  in my account and three pay checks to turn in with rent and insurance to pay if this isnt fixed by the end of the month ill have no choice but to change banks,1i never have any problems with the app loading or navigating my way around any glitches etc the only thing id change is the start up picture in the daynight its only one picture i think it would be cool if different daysnights there would be a different picture around the town im in ex i live in las vegas and during the day the picture is a man riding a bicycle around red rock at night it is the bellagio fountains i think a few different pictures around the valley during ampm would be cool ,1i absolutely love this chase app  it really has a nice smooth user interface and i love how its accessible with touch id on the iphone  youre able to view statements see posted and pending transactions check your rewards balance amp cash in rewards dollars all from the app  one thing i would love to see the chase freedom card offer is a free monthly fico score  i think that would keep them competitive with the discover it card amp its a really great feature to have  all in all wonderful app  highly recommend,1i use this on a daily basis it is amazing ive banked at a couple of different places but none of them come close to chase bank the app is top of the line and when i go in they are the absolute sweetest they greet me by name and ask if theres anything they can help me with i had my daughter with me one day and i had a guy that worked there come up and fill out my deposit slip for me while i waited in line i cannot say enough good things about them and this app i will forever bank with chase,0the app is ok it does work flawlessly however the app looks more like a facebook coveragewall than a banking app i cant see check images or deposit images cant edit transaction description for example i can only see check  there is no way to see the image of the check or edit the description if i have to look at older transactions i might not know what the check transaction was for mobile check deposit limit is too low bofa allows me up to  per month overall its an ok app it does get the job done but its far from perfect advice make it look feel and function more like a financial app and less like a social media app,1i love this app and the convenience to do many transactions in a flash it saved me a couple of times when i needed to transfer money from savings to checking in order to make payments with insufficient funds from the checking account it does everything i need and more the only thing i will improve is the balance alert i get it gives me a balance that belongs to a previous transaction instead of the last transaction made everything else works fine for me,1i really enjoy the chase app because it makes checking my balance and transferring funds so easy i also love the ease at which the check cashing is as well whenever there is a mistake i call customer service and they help me very efficient and painlessly this also makes transferring money to someone else so very easy or scheduling transfers in the future which helps me put money into my savings automatically i highly recommend this app if you bank with chase,1i wouldve given it a  but they discontinued the fingerprint sign in option in my honest opinion the app was complete when it had this feature now i dread having to put my password in when i know i was once able to press an access my account immediately other than that everything works great ive got  accounts and i love that i could see them all under the same screen and still be able to navigate through all of them separately and smoothly bring the fingerprint option back ,1i used to dream of not having to endure the inconvenience of having to go to a branch to deposit a small check now i dont have to with this app now if someone could figure out how i could withdraw cash from my account without having to seek out an atm the app would be perfect otherwise it does everything else i need from checking balances transferring between accounts checking transactions and making payments from anywhere i have cell phone or wifi connection,1i love this app and i love the mini preview where i can swipe right to see my account balances my only complaint is that when transferring money the page that raises from the bottom makes it so you have to click done before sending the money because of this the instinct is to click the top right hand corner which is the log off button kind of stupid to be honest because if im transferring money i already know i dont want to log out make sense am i dumb perhaps but ya you guys dont have to have log off on ever page myonlycomplaint,1simple easy quick reliable its like its made to be quickly navigated manageable and straight forward for the user chase quick pay is amazing for doing side jobs sending friends money or even paying your rent managing your accounts is also incredibly easy and for those who still use checks the chase deposit where you just snap a photo makes it easy to deposit straight to your account in the matter of seconds great app,0i use this app for my chase credit card i set up autopay with a customer service rep while this app shows me i am enrolled in autopay i can neither view nor change the amount this is a dealbreaker for me especially because i am able to schedule another payment without being warned that a payment of xxx is already scheduled through autopay for mmdd when i view scheduled payments it will only show the additional payments i have entered the autopay is missing making me wonder if its still active or if i should pay manually it sounds as if traditional bank account holders love this app but for credit card holders it needs some work,1ive been using chase app for  months now and ive never had a problem  well organized app with easy navigation  my primary reason for downloading chase app was to deposit checks  i deposit  or  checks a month all on this convenient app  the process is very easy very fast and i couldnt be happier with the time i save through remote deposits  usually my deposit is approved and funds available within    hours  thank you chase app,1i have had chase mobile for about  years or longer  i love the convenience of depositing checks while im at home or even when im laying in bed  this app is by far superior to all other bank apps  but i shouldnt be surprised though  chase is by far the most superior bank for customer satisfaction for years now  that doesnt surprise merosalie m matthewshappy chase bankersept  i also wanted to say that this app is far better than other bank apps ratings show that very quickly so dont be offended when you hear a complaint here and there thats just how some people are  you wouldnt be able to make everyone happy with perfection which your app is close to  some people are just never satisfied it irritates me to read a review that doesnt fiti love chase always have id rate this app a  or  if i could  ,1i have been using this app for many years now and i have never come across any problems it does what you need from it and super secure plenty of choices for customizing your security settings and alerts super quick alerts as in still in the middle of finishing the transaction i just received an alert for quick pay super super easy to set up and super easy to send pay your bills extremely easy as well this app has not had any flaws so far keep up the good work chase,1i like the convenience of being able to monitor my accounts and make transactions from my phone but the alerts are slow and irritating  we get instant notifications when a purchase is made and i appreciate that  what i dont like are the alert numbers in the red circle that show up on the app icon  those alerts are annoying because they are often days old and too repetitive  sometimes i will get multiple alerts for the same transaction  the instant notifications are great but the alerts are slow and irritating,1i like the mobile app mostly for bill pay and check my account but what lacks is if you go over your balance with in  mins you get an alertwhich is good but when you get direct depositan option for alerts it sends a text up to  days later i would like to know when my direct deposit hits so im not checking on it  times on a payday update this please love the swipe to check my account balance without signing in each time lastly oversize the keyboard for easy to read keyboard then  stars will be my rating,1im new to mobile banking apps but i have been very happy with the chase platform  the few times ive made check deposits the pictures have been accepted with no problem     ive been a great western  wamu and now chase customer since  and incredibly have never had an issue with any automated feature  that includes direct deposit and every automatic bill payment that ive ever set up believe me im no fan of big banks but have to give credit where credit is due,1the chase app allows users to do most of the important transactions and adding touch id finally made sense i hardly use chase though but at least their app is far better than their terrible website for their credit cards unless they make improvements seems like they finally made significant improvements to their website now all they need to do is to allow users full access to the secure message center through this app you currently cannot send messages with the app,1this app is simple to use and provides all the information and ability available online those who have given lower responses dont see how intuitive the app is where options are located etc so i guess that questions intuitive for some all pending current balance information is easily displayed giving a balance simply tap the drop down on the right once viewing transactionsits a very clean interface,1i love using it to check my balances  i once had a credit card and  mortgages and it was very useful to go to one place for all   i now only have the credit card  my only request on that view is that they allow me to more transactions beyond the current ones instead what they have is the option to view transactions in my previous statements but those statements are available only as pdf  that doesnt make it very useful to view on my device  that would be my feature request,1most of the time the app can permit many banking functions occasional technical issues i have a couple of automatic withdrawals for utility bills and my mortgage sometimes i have gotten timely text reminders that prevented overdraft charges i really appreciate being able to deposit checks and saving a trip to the bank the one problem i have with payment to a bank credit card is that after pm it will not post the same day so i have to physically make the bank payment if i didnt schedule it early enough,1the chase online banking application is getting better and better after each release chase is doing a fantastic work with their digital application making it easier for us to perform everyday tasks i love quick pay and now being able to quick pay anyone in any bank is awesome the new look of the ui is just so nice and very intuitive they are releasing new versions free of bugs showing that they spend time testing it i just love it,1ive read the other reviews and cant say that i agree with all the negativity i pay bills deposit checks check balances and activity and move money between accounts without the issues some others seem to have  i have personal and a business account tied to my signon and have never had an issue i havent had to step into a banking center in many years because of the functionality built into this app give it a try,1this is awersome  i use it everyday  this only problem is  l would like to transfer money from one account to the other automatically using this icon its a problem i cant do that i would like to do it but i dont know how i can do it those can someone fix it so that it will automatically transfer money from one account to the other if ill like i want to transfer money from my checking account to my same account automatically can i do that,1this app is perfect for my family and our budget management   it allows us to manage our expenses and quickly access money transfers without visiting a branch or atm  the bill pay is really fast as well and allows me to pay bills immediately and never accidentally miss a payment  all my accounts and credit balances are visible via the preview screen swiping left and the integrated finger print login makes access super fast for my busy life  love this app,1the chase app is working well on my iphone i dont know why there are so many negative reviews easy to to access accounts easy to pay bills easy to set up notifications easy to cash in points for travel etc the only change i would like to see is on the preview screen it would be nice to see pendinguncleared transactions this would make it easier to determine the true balance of my checking account or my credit card account,0i used to love this app and used the quick deposit all the time now as soon as i go to take the picture it not only closes the application but closes other applications on my phone as well asked the bank about it they said to call the mobile support called mobile support they suggested deleting and reloading it didnt work called back and the new tech support person asked me what information i wanted ummm how to fix the app she couldnt help basically this app doesnt serve a purpose for me anymore best of luck if you can get it to work works die if you just need to check your account balance,1as a single parent working several jobs amp owning two businesses this app makes my life super easy i rarely make a trip to the bank because i do all my banking through the app i also dont have to physically balance my checkbook as often though i still do because i can check everything right on my phone via the app often as im out amp about shopping im adjusting to the new updates but for the yrs that ive had a smart phone amp been using the app ive been very satisfied ,0it is amazing that this app has been updated multiple times since the iphone  plus have launched and the developers behind this app still have not updated this app to fully support the iphone  plus it is unbelievable that this has still not been updated many are still waiting for the implementation of touch id and full ui and resolution support for these iphones there are many times in which you cannot click on a tab in the app because it is slightly in the wrong location or orientation chase needs to step their game up and update is up to support all ios devices not just last generations,1i love the chase app for its functionality  depositing checks and transferring money is very easy but when i downloaded the most recent version onto my brand new iphone  a pop up within the app came up notifying me that my account had been locked down and to press this button to call chase it looked very legitimate and since the popup came from inside the app i called they asked for my account number ssn and pin  which chase never does i recognized it as a scam and hung up but beware i had never heard of this happening from inside an app before so hopefully this message alerts people to its danger,1the chase app has totally changed my banking habits the local bank personnel used to know me by name because i was in there so often but after chase started enabling more banking through this app i now only need to go to a physical bank maybe once every year or two every now and then services may be down for a few hours or a day so i dont wait until the last minute to process a transaction this is an area that chase should improve  now that the app is so useful they need to improve the downtime,1wow great app it keeps track of all the pizzas i buy with my card i really wish it kept track of the cash i spend though it would also be nice if it counted the tolls i drive through every month plus i wish it told me what was on the pizzas i ordered and not just where they came from sometimes i buy things with my card even if i dont need them just to see if the app is working but it always is thats what the first star is for and the last  are because blue is my favorite color,1overall this is a pretty well designed app but the check depositing feature is really inconvenient most of the time after i take a picture of the check it fails to connect with the server and ends up not scanning the routing and account information it looks like they want me to input them manually but i cant when i tap on the fields for those numbers nothing happens and i cant get it to retry to connect to the server so it can get those numbers without canceling the whole operation and retaking the photographs of the check ugh its quicker just to drive down to the bank,0the app works fine but its very limited in scope its basically for checking balance and transactions if you try to send a new message to the customer service after being prompted to enter password bc evidently apple touchfingerprint is not sufficient you will be told to log in from a desktop seriously then the customer service is very limited in what the can do too good luck using this app from a checking account that u previously didnt set up on desktopagain no can do poorly outlined vision for this app also there is no way to log into chases full website from iphone only a mobile version which is a copy of the limited app very disappointing app,1this app is very easy and straightforward but for some reason the alerts are no longer coming to my phone i use to get a notification every morning telling me my account balance or if i had a direct deposit and since november  those stopped and i miss them ive emailed customer support no response i checked my notifications permissions and the app has all the same settings as before  i deleted and reinstalled the app to see if that would fix it and it didnt i wish that feature would come back,1this app is very easy to use easy on the eyes and very simple however i would recommend  things as i also have bank of america and these are features that i didnt know that i really like until i started using this app  iphone fingerprint to log into the app because who manually types in passwords anymore  right under each charge i would like to see what my balance was added up to its easy to see what my balance is including my pending charges without having to whip out my calculator,1eversince i have had this app my chase banking activities have been made a lot easier i have  got upwards of  cheques stowed away somewhere in my house because of the ease of remote banking snap a photo of your checks back and front follow a few simple text prompts and bingo you have made some deposits without moving a step i see this as the closest to teletravel checking my account activities on the go is another feature that i utilize daily chase you are the best,1this app is great overalleasy to use fast versatile  thorough and seamless check deposits as a freelancer i do wish the check deposit limit was a bit higher even  would be helpful i cant direct deposit most of my checks and it would be helpful if i could use the mobile deposit feature for all of my payments even so this app serves  of my needs and is safe and secure i appreciate how many updates they do including the semirecent addition of touch login best banking app ive used,1i have banked wit many different banks in my life  i have to say this app with chase is the best banking app out there transferring money from my checking to savings account is hassle free the photo scan checks about  percent of the time that works  sometimes they dont like the picture of the check however they let you know right away and if you get the check in before pm pacific time you typically receive the funds in the am hour pacific time which works perfect since im a night owl,1the chase app is perfect for your everyday account needs eg checking your balance transactions deposits ach debits etc  the only thing missing is the option to get your account number i often need this for direct deposit or setting up a bill pay and i have to log onto the web version which is a pain but i rarely have crashes so this would be the only complaint the feature to send money to other account holders is also awesome i pay my hair stylist this way now by adding her by phone number,1since inception they have continually improved this app  it is extremely useful  could be improved when depositing checks it has trouble reading checks where customers signature descends into bank s  when it requests me to verify a routing  by manually reentering it the deposit chokes and one must redo the whole check photo process  also on statements chases policy of only listing my written check s and not the full name  makes for a long process of retrieving the digital copy,1overall the app works very well i can manage my accounts and pay bills seamlessly the one complaint i have is the alert notification when i receive a notification and navigate to the menu and select alert i need to go through each of my accounts to see which one  is associated with the notification i received it would be great upon clicking the alert option in the menu it resorted my accounts in order of those which have activity prompting an alert,1i read a negative review about chase fraud protection and i had the opposite experience i received a text message as soon as they tried to use my debitvisa i replied no its not me and the transaction was immediately denied i then rec a second text telling me to call customer service i did and they had already canceled that card and issued me a new card all in less than  minutes i had to go into my local branch and they were awesome ive had nothing but superior customer service with chase,1i use this app a lot the most frustrating part about it is that i often pay my balance using two separate accounts i pay a portion from one account and then a portion from another the system will only let you schedule one payment per day so i often have to go back the day after i schedule a payment to schedule the remaining balance from my second account its frustrating and unnecessary so now i tie up a live person if i want to schedule two payments on the same day because i have to call for them to override the limit chase fix this,1early versions were a little difficult to use at times but the app as it is today works great lots of functions simple and reliablethe only thing i would like to see changed is the information displayed about each credit card account i would like to see the interest rate along with all the other information and not have to navigate out of the app to usemanage the rewards program for each cardoverall its great,1this app really does make life on the go much easier when it comes to managing and keeping track of your bank account never crashes touch id works flawlessly and changes to your account funds reflect instantly there are many other options and features but these to me are the keynotes worth mentioning i have to say chase bank does make banking w them easy and painless for people who want current uptodate info while on the move,1i have found chase to have superior user technologies both online and via the iphone app hands down the only reason im not giving  stars is because the app tells you how many alerts chase has sent you but does so in aggregate across all your accounts when you drill down to see and clear your alerts there is no clue provided as to which accounts have alerts consequently you have to explore each account individually for  accounts no big deal but with more it becomes a drag,1really cool app love the quick pay feature especially since most of my friends and family have chase i can also easily look at my balance and transactions i almost instantly receive notifications when i pay for something within  seconds and i can customize email alerts and notifications which helps keeping my spending in check never had a problem with it and i highly recommend it,1the app works but could use a lot of updatesimprovements one thing is whenever i go to make a payment i can never get it to go back to my home page so then i have to log out and back in again very time consuming if you guys could work on this that would definitely raise my rating two why cant my user info be on the same page as other banking apps example my dues date my next payment pending charges etc etc why do i have to open a pdf to see that information please make this more user friendly otherwise at this moment no more complaints ,1i literally use this app every day i pay all my bills through the chase app if i use my card it immediately shows me on my app and shows my balance i have even if the payments are pending there is no thinking or math or balancing to do the app shows you everything you need to know and answers all questions its very easy to use and i would recommend this app to everyone best part is the app is free and paying bills are free no more writing checks or sending money orders its the best really,1just like their bank i have always been a fan if small banks  more personal attention and great customer service  chase has somehow managed to craft itself into the biggest little small bank in the world  all the features and benefits you get with a massive institution without a hint of arrogance  personalized customer service at every level great products and technology that works  friendly helpful service like a local privately own small town bank,0ive been excitedly waiting for the update of the new chase mobile app and it does not disappoint now they feature banner ads on the top of their app letting you know with every single screen you navigate to that you have the ability to get a low interest credit card i love the convenience of being reminded on literally every screen taking pictures of checks has never been harder so im really learning how to use my phones camera ill give chase credit in that with only  billion in income last year theyve managed to somehow put together an app that easily performs in the top  banking apps available today,0this app has not been good since about  updates ago the online check deposit portion is super glitchy and works about half the time if youre lucky it used to work all the time and it was a lot faster now it is slow and theres also an unnecessary prompt to continue when you photograph the back of the check just more stupidity from app designers that dont have a clue what people want or needin my opinion the interface was fine as it was before all they did is change it its no better or no worse just differentto me this update was a complete waste all it did was slow the app down and make the online check deposit work less often,1this has been saving time and easing my life for quite some time now there was some ambiguity at first about comments you create for your payment only to find out that they are not visible to the vendor unless a paper check is mailed  when the payment is electronic the comment is only a note for your own records  there are variations between the iphone and ipad apps you cant seem to set up recurring payments from either app only from the browser version,1app works great and looks even better i am able to do everything i need to on the app and i dont remember ever having any issues been banking with chase since  some people have mentioned the fingerprint login being sporadic i guess theyre right although i didnt notice it until it was mentioned ive been typing my password for  years so its not a big deal to me anyways the latest update is much improved and again its just a beautiful uiux,1love the chase app and find it easier to use and more navigate than other competitors i said that a year ago but things keep changing including the things i like i get that we need updates to fix things but i am not too keen on the new look some things can be left alone i do like the fingerprint access that allows quick access and notice that a new update allows you to activate it because before it didnt always automatically come up i have no big issue with the app it works for what i need to do and know,1this app has been improved over time login is simple with fingerprint able to review transactions with ease look at checks quick pay is nice transfer between accounts is no problem deposit checks recent in app notifications for services is a little annoying but would expect they have to sell their services would like to be able to sort transactions by card holders,1the app is designed in a user friendly format love the fingerprint login and also appreciate the additional login for financial transactionsadditionally it easy to manage multiple bank accounts and credit cards  the quick pay option is great  though not related to the app my favorite service from chase are the push notifications i can set for them for any amounts and i am always aware of when anything posts to my accounts,1i really do love this app it saves me several trips to the bank i feel like im in control of my accounts i love the fact that i could transfer my money from one account to the other pay people through my quick pay and pay all my bills straight from my phone and the customer service reps are so polite and ready to help you with any concerns all i could say is try it you would not regret it youll love it as much as i do it truly is a convenient app to have,1im a new chase customer in chicago one who held off from getting an account for a long time for fear of allying myself to yet another huge corporation i have to say though that all my initial experiences with this bank have been fantastic including this app it does almost anything that youd get from your web interface including many of the features people below say it doesnt do it does show multiple accounts personal and business handles transfers beautifully allows for wire transfers and even paying bills and im superimpressed with the speed on a non gs phone sure you have to enter your password every time but id rather do that than have someone steal my iphone and access my accountsi have no complaints its free too no reason not to have it if you have a chase account and an iphone,0i have upgraded to the newest version and even completely deleted and reinstalled the app to find this feature where are you guys finding it at  i looked in the individual accounts themselves in the pay and transfer section under more i love this app and if i could have this feature it would be  stars but this is redicoulous why cant i find quick depoist  i do see the new person to person quickpay  btw i am on a new iphone  so yes it has a cameraedit now i have set this up on my wifes iphone gs and have the same problem there  i have also rebooted both phones thinking that it was unable to initialize the camera or something still no go,1i like to use the app it is convenient one thing that bugs me is the alerts i get the little red circles that say i have  or  or  alerts attached to the app icon but when i go into the app to read the alerts they disappear  i cant read anything because they are gone as soon as i try to access them i watch as the the little red dot with the number goes away and i havent read a single thing  oh well i guess you put up with the bad to go with the good so now it just something i do to get rid of the little red dot with the number in it,1this app is great i spend all day online at work and am slammed from thermite i get there till the minute i leave and i dont like going online at home so i frequently dont have time to check my due date which i always forget or see how much of my outstanding balance im going to pay now i can do it in bed when i wake up and not stress over it during my work day this app is easy and gives me all the information i need has made life so much easier i love it,0i dont get the logic behind the design but these two obvious issues have bothered me for at least two years when i receive a push alert and go to the alert section in the app it always show the alert for my st account not the account related to the push my st account is a credit card that i rarely use dont know your sorting method either the card makes no sense to be the first account so i always need to go though the list to get to the right account so annoying  if you can push account alert why cant you push quickpay notifications it should be easy to implement and would benefit your customers a lot,0this app is the reason i switch this chase account to my primary account unable to use because i do not have enough space on my phone to update is the reason i will switch backi refuse to purchase another phone or pay for additional storage just to access ive read the reviews of others using the new version and it sounds like waste of my time its disappointing that techies only catering to younger generation my mobile access was much more convenient but without the ability to use your app i too will delete  whats the point  at least i can access my other account via  telephone access an option to upgrade should of been offered not forced frustrated and im out,1it is a good app and it lets you keep on top of your finances from all most anywhere with internet connection i would definitely give it  stars when all the bugs have been fixed i would like to see been able to delete messages from chase mobile app and also when such message is deleted it needs to reflect that asap i have this annoying red  on the app and i frequently check to see if i have messages but nothing new it is the old message i have already seen and the app is never updated to reflect that please fix these errors and make the good app a great app,1i live in a small town that no longer has a chase branch or a chase atm this app saves me countless trips to the nearest branch which is about  miles away being able to deposit checks transfer money pay bills and check my balances daily while on the go is exactly what i need i rarely use cash so i dont miss local banking at all and it never crashes i appreciate that you have to log into this app separatelyit provides added security always a good thing keep up the good work chase,1i enjoy using the app to deposit checks via cellphone i dont have to wait in those long lines at the bank i only wish you could see the full break down of each transaction so that i dont have to wonder if the amount that up there is the correct balance the next the balance is less because all transactions were not paid yet once you swipe or enter your card information the money should come right out an my balance should be correct i should not have to look at previous amount in account to determine what i really have in my account,1i use this app all the time depositing checks and checking my accounts is really easy  and i can see statements right on my iphone i also love the quickpay feature even though its the only thing preventing me from giving this app  stars quickpay is very easy to use but if the person to whom youre trying to send money doesnt bank with chase then they have to go through the process of entering their bank info blah blah blah ive found that some friends dont want to do that and then i just end up using paypal if they have a paypal account,1i have been able to do everything with this app i expected makes it very easy to manage your account check your balances and even deposit checks the only complaint i have with chase bank as a whole is their  service fees which are annoying as hell a bank shouldnt have the right to take  of my hard earned money all because i didnt meet one of their monthly requirements  other than that great app and bank,1very handy app to keep track of balances etc  i especially like the online deposit feature that allows deposits from your cell phone  only complaint is that the monthly deposit limit of  is too low  also it can be a bit too particular when it comes to accepting the image for deposit  image looks great on my end very clear expandable etc but still mysteriously not clear enough for deposit  persistence usually pays off but this can get annoying  other than that great app,1i love having this app it makes things convenient to transfer funds to cover a purchase or easy to give money to my kids without having to run to the bank and withdraw i just transfer it straight into their account and they can receive it where ever they are and its made available on the spot also love the fact that chase has the quickdeposit option to upload a check by picture into your account without leaving the house,0i cannot believe the iphone app is so much more functional than the ipad app  someone obviously didnt think this through  currently im using the iphone app on my ipad because i use my ipad more frequently than my iphone  but the iphone app looks awful and has more issues with the touch id on the ipad  still i use it because of the better functionality easeofuse and touch id  someone really needs to address these issues and maybe take some cues from navy federal credit union and their app  theirs is a single multi device app that is an iphone app on iphone and ipad app on an ipad and still has all of the same functionality on both devices,1very useful and the touch id to view my accounts is perfect i like that you still need to enter your password to do anything banking related too one room for improvement i can see since this is an app on an iphone with a somewhat small screen iph make the main login page buttons and entry boxes bigger also make menu buttons throughout the whole app just a lil bigger and everything easier to read quickly makes the app more convenient to use quicker to use and less chance of a mistake happening,1ive used this app for about as long as ive had an iphone which is since they first came out had i rated it back in the day i would have given it five stars but recently it seems extremely buggy depositing checks is a nightmare each  check requiring anywhere from  to  or more tries often each failure receiving a different error message i dont have time to go to the bank and yet i have to when this blasted bug is being particularly nastyif they would only fix this id give it five stars because in every other way it pretty much does what i need it to do,1never in the same place for long from a state that doesnt even have a chase bank to over seas i can reach my account with this app from paying bills to even helping me locate the nearest chase atm machine if needed i can keep up with my checking savings and credit and the app is so easy to understand the app is only down on sundays for maintenance which is fine with me ive not had any problems with my account being misused from this app its been so helpful,1the biggest problem with this app is the fact that whenever you load the app initially touch id doesnt work crazy you have to kill the app and reload it so it will prompt you for touchid second thing most functions of bill pay exist in the app good you still cant pull up historical payment info which again is crazy last nitpick dont make me click i next to the summary to see the account summary just a wasted step but all and all a pretty good app otherwise if you use chase this app is great for the most part,1first off i really like using this app it makes it pretty easy to do the basics like deposit check or view your balances its also very well organized and i like that but even then there are a few things that bug me about this appfor one thing i would like to be able to view the details of every transaction to and from my accounts as it is currently you can only see the vendors name but even then sometimes their name begins with something different than their actual name and so it looks like an unknown vendortheres also an issue with the fingerprint login it never shows up i was under the impression id be able to sign into my chase mobile account directly from the login screen with my saved fingerprint id but the option never presents itselfid be willing to rate  stars when these and other small issues have been cleared up and i know theres actually people putting time into the app,1very satisfied with the chase mobile app one of the if not the best mobile banking app there is its so easy to deposit checks transfer money between accounts not to mention to other people with chase one of the bast parts is if you dont have a check book you can have a check mailed to whomever wherever i have chase bank of america and capitol one and the chase mobile app is by far the best one if the app has issues theyre usually fixed fairly quickly,0well i have other accounts and other bank and i use their online banking applications i see them better than this one because for instance  it doesnt remember other ids which mean like if you have more than one account you have to write the name over and over again if you want to change between your accounts and the second thing is at doesnt enable the touch id access which i find it very important  feature  for easy access to your account and i have both american express and bank of america and i love using their fingertip id access so i hope that they will they will work on these  points,1i love the app hardly ever go to the actual bank it would be extra convenient if when depositing checks if once you did the front and clicked use it would open the camera again and get ready to take a picture of the back also the camera is very sensitive and should visually indicate that it is doing something after you press the button before it actually snaps the photo getting errors saying it is too blurry blah blah is really frustrating too,1this app works exactly as one would expect it to i am seeing a lot of reviews that come down to people not keeping track of their spending it happens to the best of us but its not the fault of the appi like that it takes me less than  seconds to pay my credit card off every month i can do it anywhere i have never missed a payment and my credit is great the app is super convenient definitely recommend if youve got a chase card of some kind,1works pretty well but could use a few tweaks   even when payments are scheduled directly on the site for credit cards the app still sends you reminders of when your bill is due as if they have no information that youve scheduled payment  instead it would be more accurate and helpful if it sent you a reminder that your payment is going out on a specific date the email stating your payment has been received does not include amount or card no  not helpful,0just downloaded updated version of the app i use it mostly for mobile deposit guess what new version doesnt have camera function on my iphone  called chase tech rep was told to fix my phone guess one phone works fine with all other apps i can use from mobile banking from other banks guess what latest version of this app from chase doesnt work on three other iphones i tried it on however the app does seem to work ok on my ipad guess what this will not inconvenience me because i can make my mobile deposits two accounts i have another banks and not have to waste time going into a local branch which is what mobile deposit is all about anyway hope they get this fixed soon,1my girlfriend and i are graphic designers so we generally have pretty high standards for app design and we are constantly remarking about how surprisingly good this app is i wouldnt typically expect this type of good design by such a huge organization things usually get watered down by committee but this app works and looks great never had any bugs or problems as other reviewers have sounds like mostly device issues from the negative reviews on ios personally,1chase mobile app is user friendly paying my bills has never been easier the quick pay function is a fast way to send money to your child away at college easier than writing a check or going to the post office chase mobile app allows me to skip going to the bank to deposit a check its fast and its so easy to use the new and improved quick pay with zelle works even faster when sending or receiving money,1this app keeps on getting better the check depositing is the best part of it i was glad they added the ability to view statements making it have most of the same functionality as the website most companies set aside a small budget to build a crappy app and then let it die never updating it but chase is one of the few to constantly keep it up to date while adding useful features that are not extraneous,1i opened accounts at several different banks just to compare their mobile websites amp iphone apps chase has a great app functional easy to use and well formatted pages updates are instant and i can see charges i made before i even leave the store  only improvement i would like to see is a pin for login instead of entering user name amp password every time  too bad they leave so much to be desired as a bank because i would love to keep using this app,1ive been waiting for a chase app forever and its finally here i deposited one check and it read it but i had to re enter the routing and account numbers  i had to do it twice because it couldnt connect to the server i tried another check but again it couldnt connect to the server also there was an exclamation point next to my checking account dont know why i wasnt able to deposit a second check because it didnt connect to the server hopefully its just some bugginess that will be worked out,1i actually love chase and the app does everything i need it to do very easily since theyve added the push notifications there is no way to check the alerts and the icon stays with a red circle on it even when app is opened shocked to find no settings option in iphone general settings should be fixed next update also please integrate the rewards catalog within the app its incredibly hard to spend your reward points on the iphone since the website keeps directing to chase mobile,1im not sure what the people are talking about when they say they have no option to deposit checks i have had this app for over a year now and i have never had a problem the only time the deposit feature doesnt work is if the check is written sloppily or if the micr line at the bottom cant be read which i can understand they have to be able to read the check info this is an awesome app and i would recommend it to anyone especially if you use quickpay,1it has always worked really well and fast but with the new update its awfully slowiphone also one tweak that would be incredibly useful would to be able to use some options you can on a full site like being able to see the pdf format of the direct bills people receive electronically especially in my line of work where you have a smart phone but are limited by bank restrictions and must have bank account infootherwise has always worked well,1the app works very well on my iphone it is very user friendly and i have had no issues with the check deposits as some users are reporting what i do have a problem with is transferring money to another account it only gives me the choice to transfer to my chase accounts none of my external accounts i needed to transfer money to another bank while my laptop wasnt working and i couldnt also the alerts it always shows i have messages but i cant read them maybe i am doing something wrong,0i have been using chase mobile for years and have been very happy with it up until this update  i was hoping to continue to use it to simply get alerts check my account balances and sometimes transfer funds from my older ipod touch that i keep at home  no such luck  after years of running on os  for ipod i lost my ability to access my chase banking on that device this week i updated the os specifically to regain my banking but the touch wont update to an os past  chases update requires   i have now lost a tool that i commonly bank with and am not happy about it  its nice to have all the bells and whistles in a single app but i would have preferred to keep my limited app working too,1the app has pretty much always been good the refresh is much nicer looking however i am constantly having problems with depositing checks it almost always tells me the image isnt clear enough ive tried cleaning the camera more light etc its pretty ridiculous that you almost need a professional photo studio to deposit a check also if the image wasnt clear enough why not give us the option to input the routing and account number in the beginning  then you can have someone cross reference the picture by the way im using an iphone ,1so i would have rated this  stars because of how smooth and easy it is however i really dislike that when you are in the pay bill section you cannot see all of your grouped bill pays i organize my bill pays on bills that are due around the st of the month and then bills due around the th of the month it would be very helpful if this app would show you your grouped bills so because it does not show it i have to do it the old fashion way which is to get on an actual computer just to pay my bills its a pain,0this app pretty much did what i expected it to with little to no problems until recently for some reason i have had a lot of problems depositing checks the past month or so i rarely ran into this problem before my pictures are clear and in good lighting the app often has trouble detecting the full bank account number on the check although it is clearly visible with nothing interfering it has taken me up to x to deposit a check very annoying so now i just stop by the bank if im driving past to bypass the hassle still couldnt live without my banking apps still does a decent job with everything else,1first of all i do not like the colors too bright does not look professional having trouble depositing a check using the app i center the check within the frame but when you click next you take way more than just the check it looks like you used a wide angle lens you zoom in to get closer to the check but then the app says it could not read it there is an error suggests i deposit at a local bank horrible update very unhappy with this it used to workupdate crashing with ios  on iphone  and iphone +  cant send money on iphones having to use ipad or the kindle fire app,1ive had an account with chase for quite some time amp have never had an issue whether it be inbranch or online with the app or on the computer its fast easy and i get whatever i need done ive never done quickdeposit where you take a picture of a check to deposit it but ive done everything else from transferring money to quickpay amp ive never had a problem like i said love this bank amp love the app especially the new design of it keep up the good work ,1i will start with the positive i really like that i can deposit a check with a photo its amazing and convenient its also easy to make my house payment one click what i dont like is i get notifications of a message in the secure message center and i am unable to view it from my phone the screen is blank this app needs more work i have to actually delete the app and reinstall it in order to clear the notification from my phone main screen please address this issue chase i really enjoy using this app but i would also really enjoy it if it worked as it should,1they just added touchid which makes this app now the coolest ever easiest way to do banking  ever i always know how much money i have because chase makes it so easy fake smile and tilts head download the app now and let chase change the way you do banking youll love it next commercial not to be a perfectly happy model tv commercial customer but thats just what you get when you click to download the appi just hope that it is secure and all as well,1overall this is a great mobile banking app the only thing i would like to see added would be a link in each transaction to call the retailers phone number from the mobile device accessing the chase mobile banking app in case of any questions a customer may have as well as a link you can tapclick to see more detailed information about each transaction other than that as i said im happy with the app overall with the features i suggested id be happy to amend this review to five stars ,1one thing that bugs me if your iphones regional settings include the use of a decimal comma as opposed to a decimal point the app will refuse to enter it for example in the money transfer form making it impossible to enter centsthe developers shouldnt ask themselves why one would ever have to use a decimal comma or why the app should be used on a nonus phonethey should simply make the app regionagnostic also a way to send feedback about the app from within the app would be appreciated it would prevent many negative reviews,1first  i love the app i live three states away from the nearest chase so i am purely mobile however i ran into a situation where a double withdrawal by an outside company sent my account into overdraft easily and quickly fixed by making a deposit except chase turns off the ability to make such a deposit if your account has been overdrafted their response was to just go to the bank and make a deposit in person not an option for mobile and remote customers thank goodness for ability to transfer from an outside account  but that takes two days,1outstandingi can do all my banking from anywhere anytimesuperb service outstanding quality personnel with phone etiquette branches of been to were of out most care attention and satisfaction i am so happy that i made the switch to chase you are always with me  seven i feel very secure with the service provided with continuous vigilance over my account and banking needs thank you you will always have my business your service is one that speaks volumes of excellence,1i have recently changed my banking from one of americas finest credit unions to chase i wanted a bank that was available to me anywhere i go as my job requires me to travel a lot chase has a phenomenal system which allows me to pay bills deposit checks and visit an atm nearly anywhere i end up in my travels and never have to drive unless of course i want to use an atm way to go chase i will remain a member until someone in the banking industry invents an app that dispenses cash from my i padsincerelyjr,1dear chase app dev teami know yall pretty much only do what marketing and the business request so this isnt a dig at yallbtw keep up the great work on maintaining and improving the functionality of the app and the simplicity of it  quite easy to use  a+++ on the work  one of my preferred apps until recentlynow to my point did anyone speak up and mention that adding advertising to the log in screen of the app is akin to getting junk mail or sticking a bumper sticker on a mercedes amgthat isnt in a sponsored race  or was that one group of advocates shot down  you have my empathymy yes my chase app has always been a soothing cool blue place to log intoeven with the offers post log inuntil the garish dark blue and wordy card offer ad showed upat the log in screenhead to desk  why  why  whyif possible please change this back to the cool blue nothing of beforea fan,0i have always had great luck when it comes to banking chase has always been good to me and the app has made my life so much more simple lately though its been giving me trouble the app will launch but it never displays touch id login or allows you to enter a password just sits there for  seconds and then crashes ive tried to delete and reload the app doesnt work ive tried restarting my phone doesnt help none of my other apps do this and my phone is fairly new im not sure what to do but its to the point now that ive actually contemplated moving banks because theres no solution to it chaseplease help,1i use this app all the time its very helpful as i pay my balance in full every month and this is how i keep up with what weve spent and where  i check it often to see if my credit card has been charged the right amount as you never know anymore about restaurants and actually any other place then there are those times that my husband has charged something and forgets to tell me  i recommend this app to my family all the time i love it,1overall i have to say the app works well and is pretty efficient atleast in my personal experience however the interface could use a little cleaning up its quite unfortunate that we as chase customers have no choice in wether or not we want to see those annoying sams club and bjs advertisements on the log on screen it would also be quite helpful if the chase app team would implement a way for us users to easily have access to our account and routing numbers for direct deposit purposes right on the app the same way the capital one app allows you too,1i love the chase mobile app so easy and convenient the chase quick pay alone makes it worth it that was the feature that made me bank with chase from the beginning its so easy to exchange any amount to any person with a chase account ive paid back as small as  for someone who purchased my lunch for me and received money from people with them only knowing my email address very easy access to money exchange with a click of a button,1great app easy to use easy to log in with touch id never had problems with app features such as transferring money or paying for credit card bills beautiful user interface it would be nice if the app adds another feature like the amex app real time credit card transaction notifications on iphone i wanna see every transaction shown on my phone as a notification when i use my card please add that feature,1i have never held another bank account with another bank since moving out of nj where there is a chase on every corner to tn where chase doesnt even exist ive fallen even more in love with this app its easy to submit payments checks and stay in touch with all of your chase accounts if i could add one thing to this app it would be a required finger print id to enter the app my outlook app requires it and makes me feel more secure about my information staying private,1the app has an excellent ui and is very easy to navigate  it has all the things you might need to use on the go transfer money mobile deposit quick pay bill pay wire money and basic settings  it also has account preview when you need to just check you balance really quick without having to log in  its not without its flaws but nothing is perfect and its continuously being updated,1in the event a checking account becomes overdrawn locking the user out of the mobile check deposit feature is counterproductive blocking an account holder from depositing money into an account seems unreasonable separately the find atmbranch feature you know for when one might be locked out of mobile deposits doesnt include a map you have to click on a individual location leave the app with the get directions feature to see where an atmbranch is and you cant see where they all are in relation to each other or you,1nice job what chase has done with this new app version makes it so much better now than ever before easier to find information about my checking account very efficient and love the backgrounds used for this app definitely  starsi just have a problem trying to find my checking account number some earlier versions had it but this just shows the last  digits i guess for security purposes so i cant be too mad,1i use this app on a day to day basis are use it for multiple different purposes i like the fact that i can use it whenever and i can transfer money from my checkings in order to pay off my credit card without having to physically step into a bank it is very convenient and i highly recommend for anyone to download it in order to get the most out of your online experience right from your phone,1the chase app is simple to use and selfexplanatory it is everything you would want an app to do quickly and easily the only problem is that the onetouch does not show up very often and i need to put in my phone user name and passwordanother problem which i just discovered is in trying to write this review if the nickname is already taken it makes you go back and write your entire review again rather than just finding a new nick name,1i love banking with jp morgan chase from quick withdrawals to depositing checks from taking a quick picture this application makes banking fun and easy its very user friendly even if you are new with smart phone technology i sincerely feel bad for my peers who have to go to the bank at certain hours to deposit a check or withdrawal money i always refer to to think about doing their banking with jp morgan chase thank you for your userfriendly app and superb customer service,1i adore banking with this chase app the bill pay is great especially when im out and realize i forgot to pay something i can take of it in one minute and ease my mind it allows you to go back and review all of your past payments they are separated by each individual account you can save bills with a nickname which helps when you have multiple accounts through the same provider and need to keep track of which account youre making payments for you can also transfer money from your account to another with very minimal effort my only issue is the logging in process the finger print technology has been unavailable quite frequently entering my password just takes a second so its not horrible just annoying when im trying to get something done quickly overall the app is awesome but the fingerprint  technology can be glitchy,0as a new mom i have very little time to ever go to the bank or even sit down and deposit my checks on the app so when i do have time to sit down and take pictures of my checks and deposit them on my app i need it to work not later i need it to work now too often i finally find the time while my baby is napping to deposit the checks and i am so sick and tired of getting the error message that says unable to process at this time more than once this week i have considered leaving chase bank in order to find a bank that has less technical issues on their app this is a common technology now that all banks have and i need it to function when i have time,1i love chase by far the best bank around only wish all of my accounts are with chase this app is excellent too pay my bills on line for free sendreceive money tofrom friends and family with ease secure and easy to use everything you want from an app and a bank all rolled together customer service always there to help you so many features with this app good job chase ive been a happy customer since i went to chase and still happy today thank you,1update transfer funds between accounts does not work now im sure it will be fixed so im not going to give a bad review because of it the app is far better than it was before also please add reward points to be viewed thx previous reviewgave five stars because chase did a fantastic job in updating the app to a full native iphone app only suggestion i would love to be able view my reward points possibly in the more tab thanks for the great work,1the app is great overall but when attempting to make a deposit using the quickdeposit using the iphone camera it should check your dailymonthly deposit limits before making you take a picture of the front and back of check it already asks you for the deposit amount before you take the picture so it can easily warn you ahead of time ive wasted allot of time talking pictures of checks only to find out that i was over my deposit limit,1in general i love the new look and feel of the chase banking app in a future update it would be useful for the app to show you the names you assigned to your credit card accounts in the pay bills screen currently you only see the last four digits that may be enough for most people but i have enough different accounts that im left wondering which account is the one im trying to pay presently the only way to find out is to begin a payment and then back out if its not the intended account,1i love using this app the recent change in the look is really cool i love having access to my account on my tablet it makes bill paying very easy im trying to convince my son to see if his bank offers something like this what i really appreciate other than the cool new look is the real time that it allows me to know exactly how much money i have available it also notifies me if a large withdrawal gets made cant say enough about how much easier this makes managing my financial life,1excellent application it is very secure as far as depositing checks and is always available to check your balance and exactly what transactions have gone through a great feature is find an atmbranch the only downside is that the application does not allow you to do more than transfer deposit and check your accounts balancetransactions for example you must go online in order to order checks or order a replacement credit card overall i wouldnt recommend going without it good luck,0honest i would have rated this app a  it didnt have this gaping security flaw i have called chase regarding this issue and they told me over the phone that it will be fixed when you open the app and multitasking on another app it remains open in the background the previous version of this app didnt have this issue this a banking app and should not rely on the timeout feature of the ios before the systems timeout feature kicks in your account is exposed and open to anyone that can page flip to apps hidden in the background the app should immediately close once you leave it to see another app this a financial app after all your account shouldnt remain vulnerable to prying eyes,1this app has worked flawlessly for me i can access accounts send money amp pay bills with ease i can even deposit checks with it its like having a bank teller in my pocket chase has awesome customer service and is the first bank i have dealt with that has not screwed up my money or accounts if youre not banking with chase switch now and have the best banking experience ever shout out to branch manager douglas h hall for explaining all the features of the app to me and showing that he cares,1chase provides yet another great way to bank the mobile app is convenient quick and offers the same flexibility as the online site being older i appreciate the large font used that allows ease and accuracy of reading the information the bill payment option which i love being able to use no matter where i am is functional and very userfriendly i give chase high points for a well thought out mobile site,0i have been longtime holder of a chase bank account so after hearing of their sleek and attractive quick pay system a month ago i naturally subscribed since then ive been hacked multiple times and as a result been permanently locked out of my own account having my personal and financial security compromised at this scale is unacceptable for an entity like chase as it clearly demonstrates technological incompetence and total lack of integrity on the customer service end do not download this app unless you are seriously willing to risk losing access to what rightly belongs to you and facing an impenetrable wall of ultraencrypted cybernetics that prevent you from reclaiming your own login information you have been honestly warned,1was waiting until chase implemented touch id to give this app a rating they finally brought it with the most recent update and now the app finally gets a full  stars from me i dont use the app for much more than checking my balance depositing the occasional check paying bills and sending some money using quickpay from time to time so for me the app works perfect the only thing it was missing was touch id but now that thats been integrated i really dont need anything else,1i live in a small college town where chase is one of the only societal norms and being in college if i get a check or am constantly using my credit card and need to pay it off the app is tremendously helpful there have been countless times ive paid the balance on my credit card while in line for something it has all the features that you need i love that it connects my chase freedom and my checking account together it just makes it all so much easier,1this app is impeccable it is by far one of the most convenient and efficient apps i have ever used i seriously dont know what i would do if i didnt have chase quickpay it has saved me on so many accounts i love being able to open the app in  seconds and see my balance statements and all the details and pay and recieve quickpays there is no lapse in time for sending and receiving money it is instant i will be a chase customer forever and this app has made sure of it,1chases first few attempts at a online banking app were pretty halfbaked but the latest one is very solid dependable a stylish  the critical stuff is very easy to find  you might stumble a little finding the navigations for less common actions but only for a few days or so  the tighter security might annoy you at first for locking you out or multiple required verification modes but i appreciate knowing that someone stealing my phone would have a hard time draining my accounts with the app,1it works well for everything i have used it for the check deposit could work better some bank apps have a feature where it automatically takes a picture of the check with the chase app you have to wait until its in focus etc  years ago it would have been acceptable also the check deposit limits are ridiculous i think they cover the whole month for the mobile app i guess these limitations on the regulations side so cant dock the app,1never had an issue other than with check deposits if your check deposit feature isnt working its usually because it doesnt seem like a safe enough bet for chase to gamble on whether its legit or not like my work checks always go through fine but random personal checks wont sometimes and thats probably not just because its a paycheck its because my account had a history of checks clearing okay from that employer just my thoughts,1i use this app at least daily sometimes several times a day i work long hours and am not available to go online on a computer to check my accounts during the day the mobile app works very well and i am able to do what i need to do it is easy to transfer money between accounts and to send money to others using quick pay as well as check my transactions and balances thank you chase,1i would award another half star if it let me because the only thing that could make it better would be easier management of the alerts i appreciate the level of detail you can get into with them but i do not appreciate having to drive down through five or six layers of menus just to acknowledge an alert other than that it is a fantastic mobile banking app and i use it far more often then the website these days kudos to chase for actually making it better over the + years,1generally i like the app but there is this one bug that its killing me every time there is a notification even though i go and read the message or review the notification the red number one or two for the alert keeps staying on top of the icon for the app and it doesnt go away not even after  days sometimes three daysi specifically called customer service for this issue but it doesnt seem like anything changed since this has  been happening for over four months hopefully now the qa department will now look into it,1it does everything i need it to do  but a few things would make it much more useful thumbprint verification my password is complicated and is hard to type if its good enough for apple and for fidelity it should be good enough for chase k deposit limit for us peons but much higher for those with premium account status i live too far from the branch and i often do need to deposit checks bigger than k i have to use fidelity which offers no such limits then transfer to chase transaction search,1this app works reliably for me i especially appreciate the support for touch id and the location based welcome pictures are clever but id like to see better support for keeping track ofredeeming ultimate rewards for instance why not show me a historical chart of how many points ive earned how about native redemption rather than a webview in the app im also disappointed that i manually have to enter my password to do anything with my points why no support for touch id here addfix some of these issues and id be very happy,1ive been a member of chase since  and they were the first to give me a credit card the mobile bank is great with depositing checks from your phone to transferring money between accounts the app is seamless and flawless no bugs just when there are updates which is normal even though they only do updates on sunday night which is great because that is when there is less activity thank you chase  thumbs up,1never had a problem with this app it just keeps getting better  especially the mobile platform it gives me just what i need when i need it the deposit of checks function is fantastic my only quibble is the quick pay ceiling means i have to pay my monthly lease in two payments on consecutive days to another chase account holder ive noticed that check deposit limits have gone up so why not consider the same for payments ,1update still great among its many great and useful features including the ability to track all banking and credit card transactions from anywhere at any time the push notifications feature alerting you to transactions as they happen is a terrific aid for identifying unauthorized transactions i love the check deposit feature absolutely love the quickpay feature working up the courage to use the bill pay feature this is a must have app,1this is a great app that lets me do just about everything i need to the app is easy to use and the layout is very straight forward logging in with my fingerprint is quick and easy lunch orders at work are a breeze now bc almost everyone has this app so no physical money needs to be exchanged the only complaint i have is that mobile check deposit only works  of the time i have td bank and their app accepts deposits first time every time ive given up trying to use chase for that one function one gripe  one star deduction,1ive used this app for over  years i couldnt get by without it i pay all bills transfer money use the alerts and for several years even used it to send money to my elderly mother in sc because of the alerts i have set i was able to prevent unauthorized use of our account i was alerted immediately was able to call the bank and the business the transaction was cancelled and our money was fully recovered within  hours  thanks for the great software,1its a good app but ive run into my little problems sometimes it didnt always notify me when i went past a limit i set in the app also there was a point in time where i couldnt update the app and it wouldnt let me access my account unless it was updated made no sense to me and it was very upsetting also sometimes it wont let me log in using the touch id but im sure thats my phones problem not them good app overall does the job i mainly need sometimes,1its the first bank app ive ever had so i cannot compare it to any other bank so far from all the banks i have chase has been the best one ive ever had however i only have a basic checking amp savings acct so i havent had any issues ive deposited checks via photo but noticed it takes longer for deposit to become effective so i no longer use that option i was reading other reviews and i agree that some features will be good to be added but other than that im pretty happy with chase and have kids accts for my boys,1as a long term customer from bank chicago days constant innovations by jpmorgan in particular the latest  which provides improved organization along with attractive opening page local imagesi concur with a previous reviewer who recommended as i have when asked on sitedo you have any suggestions  for those who have multiple personal as well as business accounts that the alerts be specific to the relevant accounta red dot notice should be placed next to the account being alertedcurrently its a matter of frustratingly attemptingto devine which account is involved generally resulting in ignoring this featurealmost forgot a great improvement would be to please list current interest rates on the individual credit card summaries,0the app was updated to include changes on the credit card interface as others have mentioned these changes were all bad  i can no longer create an all transactions list that includes pending charges and since charges remain pending for several days it essentially cripples your ability to properly calculate what the heck is happening in your account i now need to search using all of the criteria to get an accurate picture i dont see how this functionality is convenient or appropriate  please restore previous functionality and whats with the ridiculous pending durations,0dont like the new credit card transaction history view  please go back to running list of old transactions  so i dont have to modify dates just to see a charge from last statement even if it was yesterday and not paid for yet it clears the list to current statement only  if i could view by current balance that would be better than current statement i like to check for fraudulent charges before i pay and its not always easy to do that at beginning of statement when the list is blank  also theres a bug every time i try to redeem credit card points it says unable to connect to network and crashes  yet everything else works fine  how convenient,1chase has always given me great service and lately i have found myself going into the bank less and less because most of the resources i need for finances can be found right on this app night and day i know the balances of all my accounts and i can transfer money between them plus i can deposit checks through my phone camera via this app if you have already made the good decision of banking with chase then you need this app,1ive been using the chase mobile app since day one and have loved it th convenience of mobile deposit is unmatched unlike others here ive never had any problems with mobile deposit the app states my mobile deposit limit right up front and makes it very easy to deposit my check from home the old app worked great but the new redesign is fresh and clean and much better than before ive always been so happy with chase bank,1this is one of my favorite apps it makes it easy to do my transactions anywhere even at a red light on the way home when i forgot to set up a payment during the day it is that quick and easy to use i also love the feature where you can set up to view a quick summary of your accounts without logging in completely you do have to log in to set it up but it is so easy also love chase because inquires are responded to timely and accurately,1been using internet banking since  i currently use both web site laptop computer and iphone app chase tools have continued to improve and keep at the top of game from time to time i have used other banks to augment my finances but chase tools remain in a class all their own the preview feature without logon is a nice feature but now with touch login i usually just login directly to account summary the check deposit feature is also nice,1ive had this app for a couple of years and its truly great i dont go a day without checking it amp have honestly become dependent of this app i love quick pay and the notifications i get right after my card has been used also love how i can see every bank statement even from months ago its still there i have never had an issue with this app if you bank with chase amp dont have this app i highly recommend it its everything you need amp more,1the app is great i love chase but there are a few things to work on  how to videos or a help section would be great to be able to download checks or do certain things instead of having to look things up online also a calculator would be invaluable instead of going in and out of the app access to an embedded calculator that can function as a popup with a time limit maybe would be great either case  this app is very useful,1this app had always been pretty good but the main thing its always getting better when it needs to any minor complaints ive ever had have been fixed eventually its like all apps continuously evolving what more could you aski even had a check that the atm couldnt deposit but used this app and it was able to read it and let me avoid going to the bank woohoo disclosurei am a jpmc employee but also a customer,1overall its been greatly improved in the last several versions and i like it a lot kudos for versatility easeofuse and a photo deposit that works  i run a small business in a metropolitan area with really nasty traffic so banking without going to the bank is a godsend the only remaining speedbump for me is that it doesnt support touch id i either have to type or open up a password app to log in rather than just touching that button for a few seconds yes i know i sound spoiled rotten ,1i wrote the review that follows in quotes quite a while ago and as i havent seen any of changes i pointed out i suppose i will stand behind what i wrote last time i reviewed the chase appi read a good number of reviews here that contain quite a few great suggestions that would improve the chase app but apparently chase has gotten so big they quit listening to their customers you know who i mean chasethe very people who helped make you so big hey chase it would seem to me that you have enough money to hire the very best top tech minds to make your app more user friendly this is my original reviewi do like that i can deposit checks using my iphone i also like how i can view recent purchases in realtime one thing i am not wild about is i cant do some things on this mobile device such as change my password when i can do everything on my mobile device that i can do on my laptop i will have no problem giving this app  stars,1i like how they have decided to let you log in to your account with touch id the problem is that you still need to enter your password if you want to make a payment or any other options beyond logging in to your account the convenience is taken away if you want to do anything besides looking at your account balances hopefully they will take mine and others suggestions to allow touch id for all features of the chase app in the future other than that everything works just as well as it used to,1outstanding app easy to use especially with the thumb recognition option recently i have experienced the issue where my thumb recognition stopped working i didnt realize this was caused by updates until i read the other reviews another issue that i encountered yesterday is that all of my quickpay contacts dont show on the phone app  i had to use the computer send  to a quick pay contact that wasnt on my phone if it wasnt for these two minor issues i would have given  stars,1love the chase app between the chase online and this app i never have to go to the bank i deposit checks all the time and ive never had an issue i pay all bills online couple issues over the year with individual payees not getting their check but chase calls them on my behalf and immediately reissues the check this has only happened twice in over eight years nice clean look and easy navigation and functionality couldnt be happier,1ive been with chase for many years and the app is very convenient to have when trying to keep track of your spending and whats going on in your account the only think i dont like sometimes is at a certain point the transactions seem to switch up in order which makes it look like you spent it differently than you really did and it always seems like i have less money then i should i dont like that but theres nothing i can do,1so i have this app on my apple iphone s and it works great it tells me everything i need to know i dont have a hard time navigating it i know how to find everything im looking for i even use it to send money to my daughter and she receives it instantly i see other people are saying theyre experiencing issues with the app i have no issues with login i have no issues with any information that im seeking being convoluted i would definitely recommend it,1great functionality solid performance they do seem to put effort into finetuning and improving the app  ive had no issues with it and consider it to be invaluable sending via chase pay is fantastic so much easier than check or going to bankatmi havent had issues with the app but it seems some people have and i hope its  addressed as a banking app has no room for error i have used without major issue for at least two years,1im not sure why there are the negative reviews that there are one was complaining they needed a chase debit card to use this chase app  it is easy to use and navigate thru i use it for my business and my personal i have used it for a couple years now with no issues my only complaint has been especially at first low deposit limits but they listened and raised the limits still would like to see them higher but for now it isnt an issue,1i have used this app since i first signed up for a chase checking account  the notification options are life savers  i have never had any problems accessing my account send or receiving money or making transfers the photo check depositing is hit or miss but its rare that i have to deposit a check thanks to chase quick pay and venmo i really like this app especially now that you can see the front and back of checks cashed against your account,1im able to run  separate corporations and access personal banking all on the road at any time  we pride ourselves on agility and whether im at a client site or taking a rare day off to go boating i can transfer funds process payments and most anything else i need  occasionally i have problems depositing checks claims pic isnt clear enough  on an iphone + seems unlikely but once the deposit is accepted it never has failed to go thru,1after opening up a college account for my son  years ago i found this app so much better than the mobile app at the major banking institution i had used for  years it is easy more efficient and quicker than other mobile banking apps its because of this app that i switched all my accounts over to chase i was not looking forward to changing all my on line banking but to my surprise their on line banking is superior as well,0chase in general is a pain this app is only good for checking balances if you deposit quite a few checks into you account each day go with frost bank they have it together over there chases mobile deposit finds a reason to kick back  of the checks everyone signs through their routing numbers how come youre the only bank that cant deal with that oh and stop reminding me each time to sign the back of the check this is not a high school checking account at least give me the opportunity to dismiss your bs tips youd think chase could hire better developers than this frost is the answer,1this app is quick amp easy to navigate it has most all the features i need ie statements amp notifications i greatly appreciate the notification alerts when the current statement is available not just a balance notification so i can review my activity and the amount due amp date many banking apps force you to go to their website for information like this which takes more time and not nearly as convenient,1with this new update it gives it this minimalistic look that everyone is doing not that its bad to follow the trend but it gives it a simple look and easy navigation depositing checks and sending money is easy enough that my parents who arent tech savvy are able to accomplish such feat never had a problem with this app as much as other people have complained about it does what i need to do and thats all i could really ask for,1works well allows me to see a quick overview of all chase accounts and lets me see recent transactions if wanted i only use this app to deposit checks i cant remember the last time i went to an atm or to a branch to deposit money very helpful app  gave four stars instead of five only because most of the times when i sign in it requires my password instead of touch id even though i have that option selected not that big of a deal but if youre going to offer it please make it work all the time,1 of my favorite apps been using for years only thing i find annoying is the system clean up that happens some weekends that doesnt allow u to transfer funds amp seems to usually happen when im out on a saturday night after midnight forcing me to have to deal with embarrassment of no money where i have to ask the people im with to borrow from them just to pay them back the next day my suggestion is do the system clean up on a weekday night so that this can stop happening to me,1truthfully my review below has been fixed thank you chase i am very happy with the app and use it to post payments and check activity all of the things i need in an appthe only thing i hate which is not a part of the app is the incessant chase secret messages that you have to log in to read i know i just made a payment tell me when someone is stealing my identity and dont get hacked that is what i hope chase would be spending time on not secure messages,0i use the app to manage my chase visa card account  the main purpose of this app is to serve up advertisements for other chase products credit cards mortgages balance transfers checking and savings accounts and sponsored purchases that chase probably gets kickbacks on it has less account functionality than any other credit card app  i can only view  past statements i cant lock my account or dispute a charge  nearly every link in the menu takes you out of the app to the chase web site to view an ad for a new product and you have to sign back into the app even if you go right back to it,0this is the second time that when attempting to log in to the app it doesnt even give me an opportunity to press my finger and says something along the lines of to enable touch id go in to settings when ive already had touch id successfully enabled on the app it then proceeds to not allow me to even input my password telling me that ive exceeded the number of log in attempts and need to go to the website to reset my password all while i havent even attempted to enter a password its a really annoying bug that needs to be worked outthe same thing just happened to me for the second time this month and i had to change my password yet again please fix this bug,1i like the app but i have a couple of suggestions for alerts i use the push notifications alerts and  of the time that is why i open the app so it would be nice if i could get to the alert in less clicks  i also have email alerts turned on when im viewing the alerts in the app i dont need to see the alert twice once for push notification and the same alert again for email notification the communication method of the alert is not relevant to me,1banking online is convenient and banking by phone can be a lifesaver there are a few things that could be improved however the extra large keyboard for typing in passwords is a good feature when one bank creates this improvement its hard to understand why other banks dont copy it chase please contact the san diego county credit union to learn about this handy sign in featurethere is still too big a gap between what can be done and seen on a computer abc what can be done and seen on the phone,1perfectly easy to use sometimes faster to do a variety of banking tasks quickpay paying credit card et al than from my laptop  only criticism is when they add a banner ad on the signing screen it slows loading and previewing down andor misbehaves the last couple versions have the annoying fingerprint signin which i do not want to use  disregarding my desire just to get right to the signinpassword it forces me to wait for it to load and dismiss it  other than this minor annoyance the app works great and is a time saver,1i already had an online chase account and that made getting started with this app easy the large icons and readable text at the beginning that gives the choice of logging on contacting chase or finding an atmbranch is very nice the use is straight forward i viewed my credit card account right away and since my washington mutual accounts were just moved to chase i saw them also i can check my balances any time now,1i like the app because it keeps me from having to run downstairs all the time to pay bills or check my balancei spend most of my time upstairs in my room but it really should come with a button to clear the alerts history so i dont have to keep going to the history folder to get the push alert indicator next to the app icon to go away i think i was up to  before i finally figured out how to make it go away,1besides chase i do business with one other bank and to credit unions the other institutions apps have some serious flaws i have not found anything wrong with the chase app when i tried to use two of the other apps i frequently get a message that reads please try again later it stands to reason that if i am using a mobile app i need information on the goand usually right away please try again later doesnt get it done for me,1this is one of my most used apps on iphone i love the ease of doing all my banking without having to run to branch super plus is when i travel and dont have to find a chase bank i can do everything with app thanks chase for the wonderful app never any glitches or problems spouse uses a different bank and always has problems cant understand why everyone doesnt switch to chase makes life so so much easier  stars for sure,1overall its a great app and great updates the only thing i would like would be to be able to see checks that have been cashed other banks let you see the copy of checks that have been paid and deposited if other banks can do it most definitely chase can too other than that great added features in quick deposit and how it tells you how much you still have available to deposit via this feature chase is awesome also missing fingerprint to log in i know thats coming though right,1ive loved the chase app i can see my balance at a glance what ive purchased send money and receive tofrom friends and family and deposit checks the app really makes me have no need to go to the bank except for withdrawing using apple pay brings simplicity to no longer having to open my wallet at pick at my old card and now with touch id i no longer have to take forever to use my password this is the perfect banking app,1the chase mobile app is an excellent banking app though i have a caveat to thati have nothing to compare it to since its the only banking app ive ever used that said i use it every day and ive never had a problem with functionality of any of its featureswhich in itself indicates what a good app it is easy to use all the functions of the website and it has never been inaccessible or down now thanks to the addition of touch id it has everything i could want,1i am not a fan of american banks and i want that stated for the record however when something is done correctly i compliment it  i love this app and the banker who helped set it up  i especially like the balance alerts to my email that warns me if i need to transfer monies between accountsno more bounced cheques and train wreck nsfs because you were  under in chequing while having a had  sitting in it i adore the fact that i need not drive to an atm just to check my balancei can do it all from the toilet and read the news and check my stocks and read my emails maybe place a bid on ebay etcwhat is frightening is that smartphones have only been around since before  i used to draw painting on cave walls to communicate with peoplethis app is your rason dtre  for owning a smartphone good job chase,1i am an old holdout to electronic banking but i have to admit since giving the chase mobile app a try i have been more than pleased at first i had a lot of disappointment accessing all the features from my ipad but once i switched over to using the mobile app on my phone i have been very impressed my financial stresses have diminished significantly this app is surprisingly easy to use sooo very convenient and reliable the notifications feature has been a real life and marriage saver too  lol,1thanks chase it is one of the best banking apps i use i like how it combines all my accounts onto one homepage  chase quick pay is super easy with the app  i dont know how it would be for business stuff but for personal use it eliminates the use of using the online website or even going into the bank in addition to the alerts you set up on your accounts at the bank through emails it can do alerts by push notifications which i like,1i absolutely love this app it makes my life so much easier being able to deposit checks using the app kept me from having to go to new jersey to deposit checks when i was living in philly where there were no chase branches ive never had any problems with the appit seems to always be working and i just love being able to do all my banking from my phoneespecially when i need to do lastminute transactions thank you chase for this great app,1this app is very useful and works like a great app should no glitches super helpful and gives all pertinent data that i need to conduct business and personal dealings if you have a chase card you need this app if you dont get a chase card and download this app having it connected with marriots where i stay quite frequently is an added bonus not to mention it married to my united points as well the power connection awesome thanks for paying attention to detail with this app,1overall the app is great only thing that i would like to have on the app is what other credit cards app has the fisco or credit score tracker i have my chase slate credit card linked to my account and i would like to fave that feature also would be great since no banking app has it to be able to categorize expenses and have some sort of expenses tracker and a graph that would show it those are just suggestions to make the online banking and this app better,1i live for the paperless method i also find this app to be the epitome of everyday convenience the push and email notifications have never been late which i think is exceptional even for an automated system the only improvements i would recommend would be adding an appointment option where you can make one through the app another suggestion would be to have the option to view the atmdeposited checks it would really save me time when i do taxes,0two main issues i have with this app cannot update any personal information via the app unlike other banking apps i use whats the point in having the fingerprint technology if i still need to type in my password to do anything other than check the activity i wouldve considered chase bank to be one of the front runners when it came to such things as convenience and simplicity this app does neither of those i like the convenience of not having to log onto my laptop or ipad to update information such as mailing address email etc all of my other banks have updated their apps for the convenience of the customer so why is chase lacking behind,1after the latest update this app has been stuck on waiting i have tried to delete it and reinstall it but it wont let me ive even tried to delete it using itunes on my macbook and still the same thing is happening this is the first time i have had a problem with this app and i have had it for a while now please send an update to fix this im still giving this app a five star rating because it is a great app when working,1this a great app and works very well everything i need to manage my finances is right there very easy to use one suggestion when alerts are sent out and i click to see the alert right now i have to go through each account to find the alert when i click to see the latest alert that most current alert should open and not require me to hunt for it that is the only nit i have to pick with this keep up the great work chase,1i have gone through a lot with jomorgan chase and the only way i ever get anything resolved is if i do it myself on the app the app gives you access to things that my other banks app does not which is nice dont ever go into a chase and expect them to help they will tell you to go online and fix it your self or they will direct you to an atm if their customer service was as good as the app they would be unbeatable app  stars bank  stars,1i have a friend who works at chase and he referred me to this app once i started banking with them the overall design and accessibility is fantastic for depositing checks checking accounts and also transferring money between accounts chase quick pay is also superb allowing me to pay my friends on the go ive had issues with a phantom message every once and a while but thats it would highly recommend for all your chase banking needs,0with the notable exception of the check deposit function this is a great app  check deposit will not tell you a check cant be accepted because of a bad picture until after you have done everything typed in amount taken pictures selected account verified etc and it wont tell you which picture did not work  in addition to some checks simply not being able to be photographed to chases acceptable standard  then once you gone through all the hassle and been told your photo wasnt clear enough  chase wipes all the data and makes you start all over again  frustrating as hell,1overall one of my most used and favorite apps one improvement would be to reduce the number of steps required to pay a credit card its strangely several steps too manyalso there could really be better analytical tools to enable data visualization of spending habits gps for where tracking when how much in a time period this would keep me in your app longer and reduce the need for outside apps to do analysis,0seems every time theres an update you lose options that actual work well to gain some that fail miserably the alerts option doesnt work well at all on the mobile app it used to but now it just stays on the same screen without giving any other options and when you get the notification across every mobile device you have to clear it from each device every time it doesnt carry across to each one so you manually clear each one every time very annoyingupdateseems the app has gotten worse they really need to get this together,1the app is great for credit card services however i also have a car loan through them that i can see on the app however if i have a zero balance on my credit card it is impossible to make a payment to the car payment because the only way i can make a payment to the auto loan is if i choose make a credit card payment and then change the pay to account this is a sloppy way of explaining the issue but bottom line is there is no way to pay the credit card loan that is visible on the app of you pay your credit card off,1updatestill needs work on the paying part the most important part  touch id does not work with the paying part and you have to reenter your password  some might say chase does this on purpose to make it harder to pay so you rack up debtdesign is not great either  they are falling for the silly pencil thin font and links instead of buttons thing  no shading  layout goes against ideal human ratios of spacedecent a little slow and disorganized but other than that this is a good decent free app from chase that has most of the features of the full website account management paying balance etc and is a bit more user friendly than the mobile siteto get to the star level they would need to organize and streamline the ui and speed up the processing timei know its a secure https type thing which is probably why it takes longer but the amex app is much faster,1chase electronic banking services is banking as we always wished it would be in spite the continuous changes in communication systems and os softwares chase has stayed ahead of the curve consistently providing excellent  electronic account access you can manage or micromanage your accounts pay bills track expenditures or transfer funds  all from your phone at the breakfast table chases electronic banking services are the ones all other banks try to keep up with,1loved this app since i first started using it  been a couple of years and no complaints  i use it for both personal and my business including the quick pay for personal payments since i just moved to boston and there are no chase banks here not sure why everyone else has problems but i dont even have access to chase atms here and everything has worked just great for me  i think chase is the best in customer service and banking just wish you were in boston,1this app has made my life so much easier my previous bank did not have this technology and i was consistently having to go to the bank or go online to do banking and check balancesnow with the ability to deposit checks as well as the ability to check balances and do transfers my business runs much more smoothlyi have had no trouble from the beginning and now this is an integral part of my daily routine,1this app works just like i would expect it to it has most of the features i want to access on the go when i do not have access to the computer i get to use touch id without having to enter my password i can pay my credit card bill with a few simple steps transfer money accept quick pay transfers and deposit checks i never had the issues with app updates since my phone is setup to auto update it,1i really like the chase mobile app it is very user friendly and quickly load especially i liked the quick pay option  it is best and simple comparing to all other bank apps i feel secured mail within the app very slow and taking more time to load if it is get rectified then chase mobile app is good and best comparing with competitors appsalso if it can show the expense chart would help customers to see where they spent more and save more,1the only thing i dont like is that when you go to the page where you review your alerts you have to guess which account might have an alert as there is no indication whatsoever which account actually has an alert to review  seems obvious that the page would have a list of your accounts with some kind of indicator which accounts have alerts to be reviewed apple does this by putting a red circle with a white number in it for any apps that have notifications,1thanks for continually upgrading your app at this point in time the only thing that i would wish for is the ability to send quickpay payments with siri like i can with square cash i tend to use square cash much more do to the convenience of not having to open their app to send money it would be great to be able to say send so and so  via chase quickpay and be done with it thanks again for the addition of touch id overall i find the chase app experience excellent,1update the app is still good but i dont know why is not available for apple watch i owned a bank of america account and is very easy to know the balance in the account just from my watch without having login issues it would be great to add this feature at the chase app i used many times on week its very helpful because i can see all my accounts at the same time i make money transfers and deposit checks from the app so i dont need to go to a branch and if i need an atm the app tell me where is the most closely,1best manageable app ever very easy to use view my statements quick pay transfer money view check statements alerts when direct deposit checks in  and have been making my car payments on there for almost  years never had a problem i use this chase app daily dont know what i would do without it its always working and if they are having an update or issue they let u know ahead of time thank you so much great work,1love this online banking app  use this and phone mobile app for everything  nothing i cant do  if you havent tried quick pay you are missing out  my mom and i are constantly sending each other money  it registers immediately  i have no complaints or any issues using this to make bill payments check balances transfer money and even deposit checks  now if i could just print out my own cash instead of going to an atmlol,1update  june this app is still very good however one thing i dont like chase online bank is the new quickpay that automatically accept any fund that sends to you in the past you have the option to accept or reject end of updatei like this app because it has most of the functions i need and its handy when i dont have access to a computer compared to other mobile banks this is the best ever keep on your good work chase,1i am impressed with all the features this app delivers  i have friends who bank elsewhere and am always surprised with how little they are able to do with their banks via mobile my one request would be to better integrate the credit score check feature i understand its from a different data source  but at least have a direct link that can pop a browser window from the app otherwise its awesome,1i live overseas this app is a handy way to check balances and the check deposit function saves me from mailing the check internationally to deposit in my account i can not deposit us checks in foreign atms the check deposit feature is limited to a maximum of  last time i tried it which is too low unfortunately i use the chase website for advanced functions such as wire transfers and i do not miss these functions in the iphone app,1i mean they keep it updated and its useful to check balances and transactions plus rewards and push cashing checks with the click of a button from a camera is astounding and makes this app leave all the others in the dust even bank of americaonly annoyance is that the servers down sometimes other than that chase is the best hands down if people dont believe me read the reviews or ask somebody on the street they probably have an account,1i find it funny that your average  year old nerd trying to make it big developing apps would make a much better app than this if you paid him hour for a week but i guess a company that loses  billion for fun just doesnt have time for losing  making a better app the badges are something i find annoying on this app you have to log in go to alerts alerts history and then your badges will go away maybe im ocd in liking my apps to not show badges on the icon one thing i like about his app is the ability to cash checks still theres a  limit every  days or something stupid but its good for small checks i also like the alerts which are instant as soon as the charge goes through i set my alert to  so i know any time my card is being used so far ive never caught any theft or wrongful transactions but it makes me feel safer tldr app is ok given the chase name it leaves much to be desired,1the issue is with the app and online when accessing the credit card transactions area  there is a period of time where there go from pending status then they vanish then they reappear as posted i dont know why that isi hope chase bank realizes the problem and fixes it none of my other credit cards have this issue if they cannot correct this i will just switch to another credit card i have  it is difficult for me to keep track of our use,1i use it to pay rent both me and my roommate opened separate chase accounts i use the quick pay to send rent money into his account its also nifty for small things like drivetroughs rather than confusing the clerk with overly complicated separate orders and getting spit in your burger i can text him the cost of my meal and pay with one card it keeps a history of all transactions and i can add a message to each quick pay as notation as to what it was for pretty cool,1if you havent already gone through every there amazing review look no further than here whether you need something detailed or something easy this app is a musthave if youre actively concentrated on your chase accounts its beautiful to look at easy enough to learn and simple to incorporate in your life you wont be disappointed and its not like you have many other options as secure and simple for chase banking than the chasemade app itself,1i use this app all the time so easy to transfer money and check balances transaction history is awesome i have been using the app to deposit checks as well and so far no problem havent had any crashes errors etc i can only recall a few times the app was down for maintenance but you get plenty or warning and it happens off peak hours i also like the little touches ive noticed  as i travel  the background changes to a vista that represents the city im in ha,0the app is fine wone exception theres no way to confirm how each transaction affects your running balance wo manually balancing every monthly statement on your own despite my multiple attempts to request that chase add a running balance line under each transaction theyve refused to add this critically needed change so you can either do all the manual math yourself every month or just trust that the bank has your best interests at heart good luck wthat btwthat website mod would take the chase web developers about  seconds to fix but chase doesnt seem to care about feedback from its customers  this is one unhappy customer,1as many other i use a great number of apps on a daily basis some good some not so good this usually pertains to the stability of the app and its usefulness chase has done a great job in creating a useful and stable tool for use as chase patrons to use making our banking experience much more satisfying and convenient  the integration of the figure print security feature is the best addition so far to this app keep up the good work i highly recommend it for chase users,1i read some negative reviews where the balances were not current but i dont seem to have that problem everything appears to be in real time it works fine for my needs and i like the scan finger feature to log onto my account although i am not sure if that is more a reflection of my phone or this app i have tried the mobile check deposit and that also seemed to work well overall so far so good,1i love the chase app the touch id integration and seamless use of features like bill pay and quick transfer being easily found and used in the app make it pretty hard to be annoyed with every once in a while i get a lag but from my experience its not only not the only app that does that but its quickly fixed by restarting the app the app stays up to date and bugs are usually caught quickly overall im very happy with the app,1i have had chase for years and they were one of the banks to have an app i have never had problems with this app and it informs me with everything going on with my bank account so i dont even really have to check k just get notifications i can send and receive money through the app you can even make deposits it is very convenient and most of the time saves me a trip to the bank great app the answer is yes you should have it if you bank with chase,1this app functions well and has no problems with logging in or crashing or anything like that but its not as useful as my other credit card app this app has some good features like paying your bill though you cant add a payment source viewing statements and managing alerts i prefer being able to manage my payment sources view and redeem my rewards etc chase is a little behind the times with the current version i hope they catch up soon,1it offers a complete set of functionality including account status next payment and due date available credit credit limit transaction information previous statements automatic payment status and pay now options  my one complaint is the lack of biometric fingerprint reader login capability which is currently available with most large bank mobile banking apps  the addition of this single feature would move my rating from  to  stars,1a few slightly annoying things i dont see the need for like reentering my password to use quickpay after i already entered it  seconds ago to get into the app the double password prompt with certain features should be done away with secure message center doesnt always load on first attempt wish they would incorporate your fico score into the app like a few other banks have namely discover who has a great app and barclays those shortcomings aside it is a very solid app just needs to be improved down the road,1i dont need to do tons of banking with my work but the last year has gotten a lot more banking involved for me this app i like very much because of the fact that in a hurry weather its at work or out just enjoying the evening somewhere i can check my balance and see whats available right away no need to stop at the bank or call saves so much time has gotten me out of a few pinches i recommend this to anyone with a chase account its needed,1these are all the things that you want to hear when dealing with an app of any kind but especially one that ties to banking this app has the fingerprint password feature the ease of use by its design and most of all security with the password before you can pay if you are utilizing one of these cards or bank accounts and you do not have the app all i can say is why then i would say download it now  totally easy and friendly,1has everything i would need one small issue when i open alerts it defaults looking at my savings account alerts even when the alert is for my checking account id rather have the option to combine all alerts for all accounts into one feed rather than back out of savings to go check the checking account alertsanother small issue they do not allow you to view account numbers anywhere in the app which they do allow on the website,0every time i go to use this app it prompts me to enter the app store and it makes me update the app before i can even use it i honestly dont see very much change in the app itself you would think they would get it right without having to constantly update it also every time i go to sign in it wont let me and i have to change my password  i also think that there needs to be a touch id available for those who would like to use it i gave out three stars instead of five because of these issues and since i do enjoy the convenience of the app and it is working i gave it three stars instead of one,1this app is so easy to navigate you can access your accounts immediately after signing in and there are many functions you can perform its also got a great feature where you can see your balance without even signing in but its secure enough to use that feature without worrying about someone seeing your account information overall i recommend this app highly for anyone who has a chase bank account,1love mobile deposit works every time for mecomplaint locating alerts i see that i have an alert so i log in tap menu amp scroll down to alerts alerts history now an account comes up is it the one with the new alert no way to tell where are my other accounts i have to click on the name of the one account shown to see the list of others now which account has a new alert no way to tell have to click through details of each account and am still not sure what the latest is why is this so laborious just show me the alert already,1easy to use and access but secure receive rapid notifications to changes on your account quick check for availability of funds plus a new function for purchasing rapid notifications received but accessing actual notifications is difficult changing between accounts for reading notifications is irritatingly slow use of fingerprint id in iphone eliminates the frustration of frequent password entries,1by far the most user friendly banking app i have used my mother who is in her s always has problems using any new technology or app however she didnt have to ask questions while using this that was truly a first and worth my time to review it i love the front and back photo feature the ease of making transfers looking for transactions etc i also find this app easier to use than logging onto the chases online service,1this is a great app ive had chase for my personal accounts amp was using another bank for my business the other banking app was more complicated than i wanted i switched my business to chase amp now everything is all connected through this app i can look at my business accounts personal accounts amp my credit cards even if i dont want to log on i can swipe to the left amp look at them all so user friendly,1first chase card user here app works really well i only use it for credit card monitoring and payment it is incredibly quick for paying bills i set up the autopay option but i will periodically log in and pay it off myself i can login schedule a payment and close the app in less than a minute quick select options are great and the touch id login makes this app incredibly more useful while still staying secure nice job on this app chase,1why is chase discontinuing the ipad application who wants to conclude banking transactions on a small phone when they could use their ipad which is more convenient than sitting down at a big screen computer  i reluctantly put up with their software which does not include touch id because i have five accounts with chase im not saying im going to move those because theyve dropped the ipad application but that certainly doesnt bode well in my mind for a bank who wants to be thought of as the forerunner in technology,1works very well can get everything done there without going to full web site pay my bill see transactions since last statement view and print statement very handy not as slick and glossy as some but all the essentials are there i have a couple of chase cards so i can see them both just have to select the one i want i use it in my ipad looks like it was built to work on a phone but it works fine on the ipad updated still like it still  stars,0did my first deposit with this new version  three obvious areas that are worse in this edition first after choosing deposit the screen with a very large  displays  so should i take a picture or put in amount  not intuitive to all  second after taking pictures of the check the next screen has lots of white space but you need to scroll down to see routingaccount data rather showing at the top  third  after hitting next a very small window with very small fonts pop up with details use the whole screen and larger fonts  that does not not speak well for analysis or design,1i check the balance of my debit card every week or so to see where im at and this app is consistently needing to be updated every time i use it my goal is painstakingly simple see the double that is my balance and log off instead im forced to use data or occasionally wifi to download the latest update chase has which usually makes no visible differences especially with my phone it is frustrating because i sometimes cant download the update due to storage being full the fact that one cant avoid updating the app is ludicrous,1disappointed that a well known bank like chase has an app that isnt user friendly im  and pretty tech savvy i cant even figure out some of the features there just isnt an easy way to do things for example there isnt a pay my bill button you have to search through the menu to pay your bill and if there is a way to have auto payments each month off of your cc or checking account  i havent figured it out my payment is  of the time late wish i could have auto payments lol not too happy about that,0often my password will not be accepted even though im fairly confident i entered it correctly when this happens my account is immediately locked not multiple failed attempts just one to unlock i must reset my password but i cannot reset my password through the app because it doesnt accept any new password i try i tried about  the first time this happened and all  followed the rules i have to reset it from the computer finally after resetting i enable touch id but then one failed touch id attempt locks my account back up again i see other reviews with the exact same problem too its very frustrating and is the reason for this one star review,1this is a great app i recommend it to anyone with a chase account because its uptotheminute and you never miss a beat ive never had an issue with using it i check my account balance every day almost highly recommended a must have for account holders  plus the push notifications are wonderful my account got compromised about six months ago but i was able to catch it the second it was happening so nothing was lost life saver,1sometimes this app is fantastic other times its very frustrating you can pull statements and check your accounts very conveniently sometimes the thumbprint doesnt work to log in and i refuse to enter my password on my mobile device for obvious safety reasons also more than half the time the mobile check deposit doesnt work which is one of the main reasons i downloaded the app in the first place other than those couple things its a convenient app to have,1the app operates seamlessly for me monitoring personal and joint credit and bank accounts are a breeze i would like to see a feature allowing us to see memos we note when transferring money to the joint bank accounts i like to review my books every so often and it would be helpful to see the memos from my spouse as to what the transfers in or out of the accounts are for especially if we have to go back through transactions over the year,1this app has come a long way i use it several times a week thanks for using touch id i use it daily id like to be able to enable or disable a card linked to my account via the app it would really come in handy if i lost my card and then found it it it would also reduce the associated workload for chase associates and reduce the customers time on the phone making calls just saying otherwise loving the app keep it going,1this is a great app for me its very convenient to always know my exact account balances and this app allows me to do so very easily for example i have set up the app so that it sends me a text message with my balance every time i use my debit card chase is a very good bank the employees are very helpful and knowledgeable this app makes it easier for me to know my balances transfer money between my accounts pay bills and even make remote deposits,1this app was usable and did the job in  its awesome now finally this app is written specifically for the iphone and does not just display the mobile chase site in a browser view you can efficiently view your balances pay bills make transfers wire transfers etc  all with ease within the app the ui and usability us much better now that it is all iphone and not mobile web if you were avoiding this app before you no longer have a reason to,1i love the simplicity of transfers making payments etc but get so frustrated when i get a push alert that disappears before telling me which account it is for  i have to search each account i have about  chase accts for which account has the alert when all chase has to do is have the number of unread alerts show up in red on the account when they listed in the alert history section  of i have  unread alerts as soon as i tap on alerts the  disappears and i have to search for which account got the alert argh,0big banking is never gonna create a pleasant to use mobile app they lack the incentive the know how and the talent its not in their dna to be innovative big name banks should just become commoditized back ends that consumers never deal withi switched to simple for my bank several months ago and havent looked back i wanted online banking and a mobile app that were easy to use got that what i didnt expect was how i got better at saving money because of the goals featurewith chase it was always faster to check my balance with a text message than via the app i can check my simple balance faster than that,0the whole purpose of me switching to chase bank was because of their wonderful no hassle mobile deposit  it used to work great but now i can only deposit one check before it tells me that this check is over your monthly deposit limit please deposit this check into an atm  im not even close to the monthly limit especially the first week of the month and when you tell someone at the branch they give you lame excuses like youre probably using too many of the signature lines  really because im pretty sure it says right on the check do not sign below this line  disappointed in this easy app,1as i write this review tonight im in abu dhabi on business wherever i may be in the world the chase app works incredibly well i just moved an ira and brokerage account over and can access these along with my business personal and mortgage accounts with chase anytime i need to transfer money among accounts it can be done effortlessly with this app i also pay my bills from my iphone with the app chase is my bank and with an app like this one they keep setting a very high bar,1i am very happy with this app it saves so much time with the online deposits     we have a family business and being able to deposit check right from your phone is wonderful     the only problem i have is that we have a tree removal company and the checks vary in price a lot of checks are more than the allowed amount for an online deposit also we can reach the online deposit limit within  or  days it would be wonderful if they would take the cap off the limits,0before upgrading my ios to  on the iphone s i liked this app i especially liked the ability to remotely deposit checks since i dont live near a branch unfortunately with the update of ios  the deposit portion of the app no longer works when you take a picture of the check to make a remote deposit the use button doesnt engage the problem has been well documented for over a week per my discussion with a rep and it is not fixed im sure this isnt entirely chases fault but they should be working around the clock to fix it or theyll lose a longtime customer,0from a functionality perspective its ok and one would provide a score if  out of   however from the aesthetic perspective i would like to provide it with a zero  i was actually pensive in signing in as i thought it may be a mirror app designed to get my credentials who at chase thought this might be ok the team that delivered this needs to be fired no color scheme  no logo no apparent information on screen other than the log on portal info absolutely terrible even when you open your account information ive seen a better web dashboard for my local flower shop totally unexpected for a multi billion dollar company im actually appalled how bad it is,1this is a great app period the bar is often low for banks but chase has delivered an app that meets silicon valley standards not bank standards for usability and functionality and they are constantly trying to improve upon it plus the little touches are cool the new feature where you can swipe without having to log in is great one thing keeping it from five stars the deposit feature still has some bugs  still too hard to get it to scan checks at times overall i give it  stars tho,1generally a pretty good app  i travel a lot and use it frequently i am however annoyed by the restrictions chase has imposed on touchid authentication one can only see account balances after using touchid one cant pay a credit card balance or even check transactions a password is still required to do anything else this is just silly and adds nothing to truly enhance security i can see the value of requiring twofactor authentication to transfer funds to a third party but needing it to make a payment to ones own credit account is just security theater ,1love this app  it told me within  minutes that my car was broken into and my purse was stolen from my trunk  i received a notice from the app that money was taken from my account while i was in a park without my purse  i immediately called and cancelled the card and saved everyone more problems and stopped the thieves after the first use of my card i love the account pre view i have had no glitches or problems with this app its an extra measure of safety,1quick story i was apart of mampt bank and i was ok with it at the time but since i quit my job i didnt need it a few years later i was starting college and so i had to get a job for a car and paying off the insurance i decided to go to chase and got an account i used their phone app and i kid you not its one of my most used app on my phone its easy to view your money with you fingerprint so you dont have to type in the password every time you use it,1as a busy working mom of three and the responsible party of our finances the chase app gives me peace of mind no more guessing if we can afford extra expenses or worrying about over spending because a bill hasnt cleared with options like preview onetouch amp token we have the flexibility to make choices without regret its really nice especially since our oldest has a teen account if he ever needs cash for emergencies the chase app has our back its safe easy amp up to date,1i like the chase mobile app overall it is very convenient and easy to use i was excited when chase implemented the touch id sensor however i am annoyed that i am asked to enter my password inside the app when i am trying to do something other than looking at my transactions in my accounts if chase wants to reauthorize with my password i wish chase would implement the touch id within the app instead i have to exit out of the app and copy my complex password in my password manager,1in addition to opening a chase branch on every street corner in la chase bank also created a crazy convenient app which does everything i could imagine needing it to do and prolly some stuff i dont need as well cant remember the last time i logged into the website just dont need to the app does it all chase is great with technology i use to be with a credit union that i think must have been still been running their computers on dos thanks chase,1i love the app and to be honest i think is one of the best out there ive set mine so it keeps me post it with charges of  and up so not to keep it too low so if i go to the gas station or grocery store itll give me an instant confirmation in the form of an alert so i know when im making my purchases and not someone else but you can set yours to whatever you prefer bottom line is that is secureconvenient and to this day i havent had an issue with it ,1this chase app is much better than my boa app for example when you pay your credit card there are three amounts choices in chase app but there is no choice in boa app and you have to remember and input the amount another example is that chase quick pay is so convenient and you can send money to another chase account by only knowing hisher email address you need to know others account number to send money in boa app,1chase has always been ahead of the curve in mobile banking the quickpay and mobile check deposit are my favorite features i pay my contractor with quickpay and my tenants pay me with it we all get paid instantly and chase has all transactions recorded and easy to find for tax time etc which saves me even more time  really great for me since im not the most organized person  its also simple to use so you dont have to be techsavvy thanks,1in the past i have always had my bank accounts with unions or small banks that had two or three locations i never wanted to move to a big bank since i didnt trust them or the customer service since they have soo many clients chase has really proved me wrong the customer service is excellent the banking app is amazing and accessible all the time it really helps me keep track of my funds i would recommend chase and their banking app  stars,1the app is perfect for me the nearest atm andor branch is a  minute drive from my home so being able to check my balance and deposit checks without having to drive all the way there is amazing the only thing i would like to see change is being able to use the fingerprint scan for all of the features instead of only being able to log in with it otherwise works great love the customized alerts you can set up,1it seem chase is consistently updating the app to make improvements which i appreciate this app has always been easy to use efficient and convenient for me and im always pleasantly surprised when an update comes out and that my idea of what is already pretty great can even be better i think is due to their diligence in providing exceptional customer service wanting to provide a great product and actually listening to their customers to truly deliver,0i see that im not the only one who even though i have the touchid set up have often had to type my password to get into the app because the option to scan my fingerprint just doesnt appear on the welcome screen i understand having to type it in later within the app to perform tasks like sending money and viewing messages because you may have another person who can access your iphone with their fingerprint this app is definitely better than the bank of america app but a pretty considerable distance behind the american express app its slow clunky and again inconsistent with the login screen,1when using the ios version of the app you can use fingerprint to login making it so easy and simple to take a quick glance at your account navigation within the app is smooth and seem less its easy to deposit and transfer money like you would on a computer i dont give  stars hardly ever because there is always something that drives me nuts about any app this one deserves it great job chase for making my life just a little simpler,1chase was the first to make the best banking mobile app and they continue to improve it its great usability and i actually love using the app everything is easy to do simple and beautiful with great tips and feedback please continue to making it awesome by listening to what the users actually need to do some quick banking thanksedit they just updated the website too such focus on user experience thank you for investing in technology,1the chase bank app works great no complaints i like that you can log in with fingerprint technology instead of having to type my password in each time i feel that feature makes it safe and easy to use i also love how easy it is to transfer money from my savings to my checking and vice versa the only thing i wish it allowed me to do is look up my account and routing numbers through the app like i can conveniently do through the website,1i love that i can deposit checks with my phones camera and the app its very convenient when i cant get to the bank im also grateful for bill pay because my water company isnt set up to receive automatic payments i love automatic payments to make sure all my bills are payed on timeone of my favorite features is that the moment a transaction goes through i receive a notification on my phonei would like a calendar to track when bills are duein checking i would like to be able to set up divided labeled allocations of funds for various longterm bills like quarterly or annual payments for example because i cant do this in my checking account i have to do it in envelopes at home for homeowners insurance auto insurance dues property taxes etcalso a graph or pie chart that analyzes my spending would be greatlove the app keep up the great work,1i love that i can preview my bank acct balance without having to login also the touch id feature is great and secure after one failed attempt it does not allow u again which is great in my opinion chase quickpay is the best thing to happen to this happen no more splitting the bill amongst large parties at venues you can pick one designated person to pay the bill and everyone else can pay their portion by simply choosing to quickpay the designated acct,1i love the convenience and functionality of this app the only improvement i would suggest is the messaging and alerts if you have several chase accounts you have to select each account to see if the message or alert is in that account needs to have a notice of which account or something so you dont have to hunt down the alert  other than that minor thing this app is a god send,1i only do very basic things when banking on my phone so i cant comment on the detailed features but for my needs this is a very smooth simple app that works but i do wish there was a way to specify which fingerprints in touch id is authorized to access the account because i want to keep my phone accessible to close family members but keep my finances to myself i have disabled the touch id for this reason and just type the password now,1has all the functionality i needif i had a critique i would ask for a use touch id button on the login screen if there is some issue while loading the touch id window will sometimes not appear requiring me to either type my password or close the app and reopen it other than that it functions well and looks greatalso i wish it would stop asking me to rate it this is my rd time and yet the request continues to pop up in the app this again cancels the ability to use touch id and i have to resetrestart the app for it to log in with fingerprint,1i have found it reasonable enough so far  i did have a single issue where the person who set up my account didnt set up a transfer to savings each month like she said she did costing me  a month for about  months  thankfully i got help and they fixed two months but it doesnt fully rectify what she didnt do  anyhow otherwise this has been a wonderful bank and easy to deal with i hope it continues,1the app is easy to use and great for quick review of charges and moving money or paying your bills the app would be made better by offering tools for new account holders that could use some guidance on how to best manage a bank account and spend in smarter ways this runs against some of chases interests but i think with the healthy skepticism that exists with consumers towards banking it would help grow confidence in chase and build long term clients,1had no problem works well just wish the pop up to rate the app didnt pop up so much cause it keeps touch id from activating and i have to exit the app and renter the app to make it ask for touch id again the app is great but i feel like i was forced to write a review so here you goupdate apparently it still pops up even though i rated it already so annoying same issue with it keeping touch id from appearing hopefully this addendum solves the issue,1since my last rating the redundancy of emails when i pay my credit card has completely stopped yayi like the convenience of the app especially the depositing feature  but having transactions listed as pending is slightly annoying i have found that using the app for a deposit late on a friday actually takes longer than if i would have just made a trip to the bank on saturday but now that i learned that the hard way i can make better decisions going forward,1chase mobile app can be better they make too many adjustments with your account and makes me think they stealing my money at times so i quickly take my direct deposits out and add money when i need to use my atm card they recently made an adjustment of  bucksto this day i still dont believe they messed up and fixed i believe they took it i know before they would charge extra monthly fees and give it back once you call i really dont trust chase bank at all i only use them because i do business with clients and need quick transfers,0i used to love this app  and the convenience and security of using touch id to log on  now after years of using this app touch id will randomly turn itself off and additionally will tell you too many log on attempts after one try with touch id the only solution at this point  reset password  i have reset my password  times in the last  months after having the same password for seven years  so now about once a week a quick check of my bank account turns into a halfhour ordeal and a new password  garbage  attention chase it department and app developers  fix this crap its not complicated stuff  i am about to switch banks over this,1i think this is a great app simple to use easy to log into easy to maneuver around and makes my banking life a lot easier and more accessible from checking balances depositing checks through photos transferring funds viewing transactions both pending and through sending checks paying bills owed paying mymortgage cashing in on earned points to reviewing other credit card options this app works great for me highly recommend,1everything about this app is amazing im able to check my bank account anywhere im at and deposits checks right on the spot i love the app for sure recommend it to other people who have chase one thing that would complete this app would be to add it to apple watch applications so that i can see my bank account on the watch i hope yall are able to do that later on in the future please do it thank you,1i love the chase bank app its very convenient and reliable i can get my current balance transfer money between accounts or even use the amazing chase quick pay feature to send money to friends and family who also have chase bank ive had the app since i started using this bank and all bugs which hardly happens have been fixed in a timely fashion thank you for being an amazing bank and having an amazing app ,0easy to use and very helpful better then the other banking apps   that was my old review app is very problematic every couple of weeks it turns off the touch id says i have to log on to turn back on when i attempt to do so it locks me out with a to many attempts and forces me to change my password which is a pain to do i dont know who is in charge of developing and maintains this app but this is getting old and annoying they used to be better then the other banking apps but now are just as bad of not worse please hire back who you hand before to maintain the apps and dont cheap out on trying to save money  until this is fixed im giving one star,1this is a good app for all the basic functions you need to monitor your account but  important option left out is the ability to actively cancel your cards immediately incase you suspect someone has compromised your account info you are limited to calling customer care with certain requests also you cannot request to transfer your reward points to a card via the app you have to call in and do it overall the only thing this app really helps me with is monitoring my account as it is a fast application,1the app works pretty well and it is great to have account access on the go the deposit feature is nice to have but it is a bit touchy any shake can cause enough blurriness to reject the deposit and then you have to start all over the  daily limit is a pain especially when i am dealing with the work account for the deposit it would be nice to be able to email yourself a deposit confirmation along with the images of the front and back of the checks for reference,1i check my account daily love this app make it so you can check your chase emails and id give it  you cant even check your chase email on the mobile site either kinda annoying the quick deposit doesnt work as nice either most of the time the pictures arent good enough and if they are it takes around  days before it actually deposits also for the people with reward points add a point store to spend points on i know they did away with it but i still have  points to blow,1read negative reviews and never had these issues i live remote deposit it takes about  minute to scan a check for instant deposit i never have to go to a bank again  the app is easy to use i can pay chase credit card from checking with ease i love the alert options and like to get an alert with daily balance it is easy to turn off if you dont want it too it has never crashed on me and is always there when needed,1please please please changerevamp the alerts sectioni appreciate getting alerts but there is no way to just view the specific new alerts i have multiple accounts and as soon as i go to alerts i see one but i have no idea what the new alerts for my other accounts were make all new alerts show up on one page next add a link to send bugs errors issues to if you hit app support it just takes to the app advertising part of your website i already knowhave the app and need to report a bug i feel like we are charlie brown and you wont listen to us thx,1i truly appreciate having this app i have a very busy life and have to use my phone throughout my entire day to help me manage what i have to do and stay organized this chase app is a great app to have and proves to be far quicker and simpler than any other method for me to keep tabs on my money when i need to check how im doing on money it just takes me a few seconds to start the app and get into my account and that accessibility is priceless to me,1as far as banking mobile apps go chase bank is the best ive had wells fargo td bank amp bank of america maybe chase has best team behind them i dont know all is know is from my experience chase app is better than any other mobile bank app ive used i get notifications every time i use my card none of the other previous banks mentioned can even come close to chase banks level of service all i can say is that the chase bank app is by far the best ive used amp ive used  others,1chases mobile app was among the first in the us and by far still holds the title for being the best pay bills and make deposits anywhere quick pay is fantastic for paying friends the app means i carry significantly less cash and have significantly more access via my phone love it i only wish it allowed me the full functionality of the website specifically to set international travel alerts from a trusted device,1i use this app everyday  whether its to receive my daily balance via push notifications to check a transaction or to pay someone through quick pay its fast and convenient that is when i dont need to update the app every single time i open it it seems like every few weeks im required to update the app in order to keep using it which makes using quick pay more of a login attemptupdatelogin againquick pay process an update here and there is greatbut this is just getting ridiculous,1the prior app was just fine and had all the functionality one could need to do mobile banking the new version merely adds pictures and other unneeded asthetic fluff without adding any additional functionality  still a solid app but now it has a busier user interface and runs slightly slowerhave since left chase due to added fees on my checking account and switched to a credit union  their app is much easier to use does more and is faster  im finding using a credit union is far superior to the chase experience,1i have really appreciated this app and use it frequently for the most part i find it very welldesigned and intuitive the one thing that is not is the alert identification process when you have an alert that helpful red ball leads the way up until you get to that long list of your accountsthen it disappears youre left to search thru the list of accounts looking at dates to see to what account the alert refers all in all however i find this to be a very useful app,0i loved this app it was smooth and functional and made everything so easy and i was very happy when touch id was available for logging in however the app has given me nothing but problems every single time i try to log in it keeps telling me it doesnt recognize my device the only device i ever use and i keep having to get a verification number sent to my phone and i have to keep putting it in yet when i log off to see if it worked it again says it doesnt recognize my device the same device i have already verified like  times in a row it kinda makes all the awesome stuff about this app seem like crap,1i dont take the time out to rate apps even if i absolutely hate them chase is different however if you bank with chase id recommend this app a million times i deposit my paychecks sitting on my bed it really cannot get any easier its simple easy to use great to keep track of the activity on your account super easy to deposit checks although currently theres a  limit to that bottom line this app fulfills its purpose,1chase was one of the first app to come out with the mobile deposit ive been using it for years and have had no problem or struggles taking the pictures and depositing my checks its very friendly to use and practical wells fargo app does not come close as it struggles to read the checks and declines them half of the time thank goodness for this feature it saves me a whole lot of time and trip to the bank,1this new version of the app has great curb appeal is very user friendly and allows you to accomplish all your tasks for the individual where time is a premium i love its urban nyc scene design and am amazed at how far technology has come as a business owner i use the app for both personal and business accounts and it always keeps me up to the minute on any and all changes in my accountsthank you chase for creating the best banking tool with me in mind,0while i used to not have a problem with chase and the app i now and beyond annoyed and just about to change banks because the app does not recognize my mobile device therefore everytime i want to log in i have to go thru the whole process of getting a text sent to me to verify security which now takes xs as long to log in also my finger print log in will not stay when i turn it on it keeps kicking me out and asks me to log in and change the settings again ive had it with chase and will be switching i need something easy fast and seamless and that is not chase im only give one start because it wont allow me to not give at least one yet another flaw,1love this app i have accounts at several banks and this app is by far the most useful and convenient i love deposits by photo and all the alerts i can set i get a text alert for every transaction on my acct so i know immediately if something happens that i didnt do or authorize viewing or searching my account transaction is easy too all in all the best banking app out therewould love to see fingerprint access instead of passcode on phones so equipped,1i use this app to deposit checks glad they raised the dollar amount limit to pay my bills to send people money and never have a problem i like that you can see your actual checks in the checking account also i love that all my accounts are here on one app  checking savings credit card and mortgage its easy to transfer money between accounts i like seeing my mortgage balance going down each month great app,1this is the best bank app ive used and ive used many i have never had a problem with the chase app or chase bank in general i use the quick check deposits easy transfers to chase accountscredit cards and other accounts chase quick pay and bill pay all work great fast and any questions i have are answered the moment i think of them chase you really thought this app through and it shows thank you,1the chase mobile app is way better than my former banking affiliations online site because chase deducts the funds from my account when it funds a bill pay transaction the available balance is not overstated so the only way to generate an nsf fee is to pay someone by paper check and then forget to keep track of the payment until it hits the bank i must have saved  or more in the past  months alone chase is my best friend forever ,1ive had this app for at least a couple of years now and they just added credit card ads so if the bank makes money off of my business with them then why are they adding ads instead of options like direct deposit forms or check ordering and something like online bill payment search tools or other options so that i dont have to get on the computer or go to the bank to have things changed or added to my account,1i love how you can quickly send money through quick chase you spend no time at the bank trying to make sure you get money to give to someone or for your bills its a real time saver honesty it beats all other apps i have used the best part is that it keeps track of what you spend and the notifications you get whats also nice is that you go paperless at the end of the month i love this app thanks chase for making my life a little less stressful,1i absolutely love the chase mobile banking app i am essentially able to do everything i would be able to do in person at the bank from my phone which is convenient when you dont have the time the transfer quick pay mobile deposits alerts and ability to customize settings have all been a huge blessing there are many features i havent even tried yet awesome job chase,0i loved this app last version but as always they ruined it it used to be very intuitive and what really irks me is the sign on now you have to use your id and password no matter what the whole idea of the touch log in was so you didnt have to put in that info in public now you have to do both i used to use the app but now i cant because my password is to important to allow anyone to possibly see it this version is of no use except at home but then why i gave it two stars because they left functionality there but they changed the gooey and now its just functional not pleasing to look at and use,1my first experience with mobile banking was through lakeland bank and just for the fact that im currently using chase now is proof enough that lakeland has terrible unresponsive out of date mobile banking chases deposits alone are significantly faster and more efficient on top of that the layout of it couldnt be simpler ive had few questions on how to navigate and understand certain terminology but for the very few i had i found in the faq tab,1i have found this app to be very convenient i use it mostly for persontoperson transfers this app saves me several trips to the bank ive also used it to keep track of my balance and make account transfers being able to do this without driving to the bank is very helpful also since it works when the bank is closed that makes it even better i have not found any glitches thus far,1i switched from huntington to chase for a few reasons one of them being the ease and accessibility of their app i can check my balance effortlessly i have an alert for if my account gets below a set amount and those alerts come instantly with other banking apps they always say this app is currently unavailable do to maintenance i have not had that happen with the chase app another plus it looks modern and sleek,1this is a great app it is easy and very convenient to deposit checks especially when you live an hour away from your bank like myself the only thing i dont like about it is that once the checks are accepted there is no way to identify the check other than the amount i own a gym and most of the time i will have several check all with the same amount so it is hard to see which ones have cleared with no verification number or picture,1ive been a customer for years and all my kids got their first accounts at chase as well love the ease of the app especially the feature where you dont even have to sign in you can just skip and see balance quickly never a problem with it and use quick pay to pay my rent and all my bills arepaid online which means i never have to mail a bill or buy a stamp and nothing is ever lost in the mail,1first off i dropped my rating because it asks me to rate and review the app but every time i do i write my review for the th time now it just deletes my message because my nickname is already taken each time i wrote a different one this should be fixed which is the only reason i am writing the review is for the fact that this should be fixed also the app is easy to use and quick access to account the only thing id like to see is the option to click on transactions or pending and see details like the exact time the transaction took place,1ive been a chase customer for years and have had the app from the beginning and use it regularly to manage check balances make transfers and use quick pay between my personal and business accounts chase continues to make improvements to it which tells me they are responsive to feedback i particularly like the fingerprint sign in and ability to send money via quick pay,1every time i open the app instead of touch id just working and logging me in theres a dumb message that says ive been logged out well duh now why isnt touch id launching immediately instead of showing this message sometimes it just sits there and  seconds later touch id will finally pop up i also dont need periodic pop up message to tell me that my session expires soon when im logged in if it expires just bring up the touch id prompt done otherwise great app very clean with just the right features,1i can do almost all of my banking on my iphone  love this app   chase has done well to make continued improvements in their technology  i got a citicard in the mail and enrolled in their online banking  the process was painstaking and i hated their app and especially their customer service  back to being a loyal chase customer  most of my friends have chase accounts and we love the chase quickpay  makes travel expenses between friends super easy,1i  chase mobile i can transfer funds to my loved ones and it is available immediately you can deposit your paychecks via chase mobile deposit within the app which has a later deposit cutoff time than the atm and the branch chase is consistently  updating its features my whole family banks with chase for the above mentioned reasons btw the chase mobile app is reliable and never has errors rare these days,1this app is wonderful and easy to use the people at the bank however not so much each time i would go they would tell me to basically quit coming in and use the atm to bank finally i did and besides the fact they put it directly in the sun so you cannot even see what it says fact is i like to do business with people not a machine not everyone is a millennial i am just disappointed and will leave the bank eventually,1the chase app is really quite excellent i dont say that a lot of the time with banking apps after spending a long time with the simple bank i recently moved all my accounts to chase and have been fully satisfied the app is elegant supports touch id well and has every feature i would expect from a banking app the app is officially better than wells fargo which is getting very antiquated at this point and im glad for it,1once you get all your information into the app which takes a few minutes this app is super easy to use i can use my thumbprint to login really quickly transfer money to other bank accounts with zero hassle although all transfers like that usually take a couple days no matter who your bank is see my account status instantly and i dont think it has glitchd out on me yet so that is cool too very sweet app i am impressed,1my husband and i use this frequently throughout the week to quickly check balances do transfers and seamlessly pay a credit card account balance logging in is never a problem the app is reliable doesnt have any working problems i rely on this app on my iphone for everything to do with our money and i have never had a complaint even with updates to itplease keep up the good work on this appthank you,1i like this app it is convenient and works very quickly i gave it four instead if five stars because the payments are not always posted when my bills have been paid it leaves me thinking i have more money in my account than i actually do i have also had the trouble of having my bills paid twice however that was fixed luckily i keep my own tabs on it also sometimes it crashes please fix this otherwise its an awesome app super helpful and convenient eliminates all the receipts,0this banking app works moderately well but in no way is better than any of their competitors that said it is entirely deficient in the complete inability to edit or create repeating payments or even see ones that you already have for those features you can only use the full desktop browser version which is in accessible on a mobile device because it reroutes you back to the mobile browser version which also does not have this feature not a brilliant move in this increasinglymobile world were in now also lots of product upsell going on at every turn,1for some reason since the most recent updates my app decided to start giving me a headache more than being helpful touch id turns off randomly and forces me to enter my password more often than not then i type my password very slowly and it gives me a youve tried your password too many times error even though ive only tried it once ive had to change my passwords more than  times in the past  months it is very aggravating because it makes me not want to log in,1very frequently do i run into a problem of not being able to log in there are constant server issues preventing me from logging in on a regular basis if i had to guesstimate the percentage of times ive logged in flawlessly to the times ive had an issue i would say its  this is unacceptable for a commercial bank as large as chase is and they should really work this issue out there is very little holding customers loyal to a bank nowadays and minor service irks like this one could push someone to switch to another bank,1this app is typically always reliable even when im not connected to the internet which is extremely helpful i always check my balance before going into any store however touch id almost always never works which can be frustrating at times when u need just a quick look frequently thruout the day there are times i will see a na on all of my accounts usually when i see this i log out and than back in and it has been fixed,1oh this is one of the best apps that ive got you can do so much at home from depositing checks looking at account balance transfer money pay bills all in all this app is done very well update even with the new version the app still works great it keeps me in the know if you dont have this app yet definitely think about getting it rd update the new platform works great the few tweaks keeps the charm of the app keep up the good work,1i have been using this app for a year now and i am very happy with the things it offers i like how you can access your statements on the app you can also find their contact information right there on the app after the update i saw that it was a lot more helpful but i would like to know if there is an option on the app that you can use to pay some amounts back based on the money you have earned over all very good job,0this app is not amazing quite frustrating actually the quick deposit doesnt work properly quick deposit is why i got the app in the first place  also i kept getting an error message that the image isnt clear enough and to retake the picture  after about  attempts it finally worked it even asked me to enter the routing amp account number on the check the push notifications is annoying as well cant clear the alert badges  i can get the same info by text from chase i finally deleted the app yesterday people who are rating this app with  amp  stars are misleading you come on people   star is very bad and  stars is excellent  and this app is not excellent,1i honestly think this might be the best app ive downloaded so far in regards to making life easier the picture check deposit works great i no longer have to wait in long lines and deal with peopleclerks chatting for extra min that are not bank related great for people who have a busy schedule or whos bank may be too faryou might have to submit the check more than once the first time i got an error overall i am pleased,1this app works real good those of you who are having problem connecting to the app must change your router the issue is not the app but the router you are using if you own the router try to upgrade the firmware i had a comcast router and i asked comcast to change the setting to a bridge and i use my own router and was able to connect to the app when i was not able to before also this is affecting your back up with icloud on os devices on your wifi network,1i love the chase app it is extremely user friendly allowing me to check balances on the go and to pay my credit card with only a few taps the update makes the home screen look very sleek and streamlined and i love that once i pay my bill i am notified and reminded via text email and app notification very convenient for an onthego person who wants to pay bills check balances and transfer money quickly and easily,0i have used the chase app for years and loved it i have several chase accounts and use the app mainly to verify balances look at specific transactions and deposit checks heres why i dislike the newest version first i have never used the phone app to pay bills yet the main screen devotes extra space for each account to offer the bill pay option which means i have to do a lot of scrolling to see all my accounts second when i am doing all that extra scrolling the screen tooeasily slides over to show the menu on the left edge instead of staying on the info i want to see ugh chase has had the best bank app for years but this one is awkward to use,1excellent app that aligns well with the pc version covers all the functions i need to accomplish this is your branch in your pocket the alerts for each account allow for monitoring at whatever level you choose and they are issued immediately when the condition is metdeposits are quick and easy as are bill paying transfers between accounts and a feature called quickpay with quickpay you can send money to anyone at any bank on your approved list,1the chase mobile app is both convenient and reliable for a college student with a very tight money schedule its nice to know the status of my funds  works well with all kinds of wifi and notifies you of any discrepancies that you may come about and it always tells me when ive over spent and when ive been paid also quick pay as an option to anything is the best thing chase has ever invented saved us so much stress,0chase cannot get this app right  update after update fails to address the inability to be able to deposit checks  the app refuses to accept pictures of the checks saying that they arent clear enough  this despite taking perfectly clear and bright and focused pictures in good light and then retaking the photos and then retaking them again and again and again and again and againthis app wastes time and is nothing but frustrating  im now off to drive to the bank to deposit a check because this app fails to do solooks like ill be moving all my accounts over to wells fargo who cares enough about their customers to make a satisfying mobile app experience,1trying not to sound like an advertisement for chase but the mobile app just promotes convenient banking to a new much higher level  the federal government shouldnt demonize banks they should emulate them  accounting tracking and moving money has never been easier and no security issues yet  ill be paying with a debit card somewhere and before the merchant hands me my goods and receipt chase confirms the transaction by via swoosh textmuch better than wells fargo,1i use this app all the time works great for depositing checks i also use it to transfer funds via chase quickpay and of course to check my balance i also like that i can use my fingerprint to log in you can set up account alerts to notify you when purchases or withdrawals are over a certain limit or when your account balance gets low nothing to complain about here everything works and its intuitive to use,1i have used the mobile app for years now but love the last update very simple to use love the fingerprint access and appreciate the added security of entering my password in order to transfer funds i know how easy it is for your money to be stolen after working in banking for  years and would be better safe than sorry if my yo can figure out how to add his fingerprint and access my phone id hate to see what a criminal can do,1i love that you can do many of the same things as the website on the app however every couple days it forgets that i have touch id and makes me go through the whole process of making the app work with that as well as making me sign back in when i switch between apps like when i need to see how much is in my bank account then switch back to chase to pay my credit bill also annoying that i couldnt set up payment from my bank account on the app and was forced to do it on the website,1by far the best banking app that i have ever used or seen the app is very easy to use and makes money management a breeze the app is also very fast in sending out alerts every time i make a purchase that triggers an alert the alert shows up on my phone before i can ever get close to putting my card back into my wallet i have several friends and family members who have switched to chase just to be able to use this fantastic bank app,1i usually dont rate apps in here but this needs  stars if i can do it i use it everyday to deposit checks make transfers send money and pay my bills the chase team did such a good job with this app that i rarely use the website anymore it can almost do everything that i need it to do the touch id is a very good addition to this app the need to enter the password to do extras makes me feel secure that someone needs dual authorization to take my money,1i love this app it is the most convenient app i have its great and easy to work with if you banks with chase its a must the only thing that annoys me is that the notification to use the quick touch feature always pops up and its annoying when im trying to use the quick view option i wish after using the app for so long that that quick touch notification would just turn off and if i want to use it i will just do so or if o want to see the quick view option i can just swipe,1nice pictures that change with travel although they could us a little more variety one problem is that if you try to log in to any wifi other than your home it will not recognize your device and you have to keep getting new security codes sent to you via text or email can get quite annoying if you have to log in frequently also last update erased all my alert notification alarms and lost the fingerprint setting that added to the security issues and almost had me delete the app,1living in a remote area amp traveling a lot this method of banking is a lifesaver i can do everything on my phone i can do at a bank or atm except get actual money out since theyve made mobile deposit a feature i can do all my banking on my iphone the alerts let me know if something occurs that needs my attention amp i can even check statements this works very well for me thanks for the continuous improvement,1overall this is an amazing app like a swiss army knife of banking tools this app is well laid out and full of nearly every feature you could ask for to make payments or deposits and transfer money between accounts the only negative thing i can say about it is the managing of alert notifications for your accounts it doesnt differentiate them when you get them forcing you to drill down through each one to see what its talking about,1i use this app frequently to deposit transfer quick pay and check balances without any problemsno crashes the one annoying thing is reading alerts when one clicks on alerts it goes another menu offering view alerts or manage alerts then one must click again to view alerts it would be more efficient to go directly to the page to view the alerts and have a button to manage alerts on that page otherwise its great,1i love the ease of managing my account from my phone i may need to log in from a computer oncetwice per year i can do pretty much everything from the app my favorite functions are the fingerprint log in and swipe preview with as long and complicated as your passwords have to be now days it is very nice to skip that by just placing your finger on the home key i wouldnt expect any less from chase they value their clients no matter how small,1its nice being able to check my balance whenever i want without leaving to go anywhere i especially cherish the ability to deposit checks from the comfort of my own home the integration of the ability to access accounts via the iphone touchid is another nice perk i havent encountered any issues during my use of the app and so look forward to seeing any new features that may arise in the coming years,1this review is from the perspective of a chase credit card user and not a banking user as a former banking user the features were top notch the credit card feature lacks ability to search transactions to look back one must look at a pdf of a statement report which is woefully insufficient also the security of needing to type in a password to pay the credit card or review messages is an unnecessary annoyance otherwise it gets the job done and earns a  please give some ux thought to the credit card users and add some use cases,1the alerts feature needs some work i shouldnt have to pick through each account type to see if the alert pertains to that acct the first screen in the alerts menu should have a complete list of all of your accounts and an alert indicator for each line current functionality is cumbersome and annoyingand why on earth would you make my phone buzz when i type an incorrect character in my user id if its wrong its wrong you dont need to give an unauthorized user help in trying to crack it,1the chase app is a great app overall and has many great features  i would recommend this app to any chase bank account holder to use for their banking needs  i really like the live updates i get any time money hits my account or any transactions that have accrued on my account the moment they are processed  so i give the app s because there is always room for improvement although i dont know that there is much more that can be done to improve this app  the developers really did a great job on this app,1i love how convenient it is to access my bank account whenever the app truly serves its purpose however it doesnt accurately show my balance i dont know if its the bank fault or theres a glitch i would love to give it  stars because it has potential but the error keeps occurringi made a complaint to customer service and they told me i should write down and calculate all my transactions uhh why should i do that when i have this app for such purposes its annoying so whatever the issue maybe fix it if its the bank or the app fix it please,1it really is a bestofitskind app smooth pleasant to look at does its job and gets out of the way except when it asks you if youll leave a review at that point when you say ask me later the prompt to use touch id never pops up what if i just wanted to view my balance before dinner i dont want to dig out my password manager so next time perhaps ask for a review at a point after the user puts their password in for a more complex time consuming function and then next time youd get five stars,1i have been with a few banks throughout my life for basic debit and credit card needs but i must say that chase is one of the best excellent customer service from the app to the branches chase has one of the nicest designed apps that let you easily access all your banking information necessary as well as even schedule transfers amongst other convenient things there is always room for improvement but this app definitely is great,1since moving from a strictly local bank to one nationwide ive had nothing but great things to say about chase and its app one feels apprehensive anytime money is dealt with via aitechnology fortunately my experience has been smooth and the services always work for me if someone is amiss im notified and customer service has rectified any concern of mine always wish i had more in the bank nevertheless i enjoy being a customer of this company and an user of the app,1chase has done a fantastic job with this app almost everything you will need for consumer banking is smooth and easy to use bonus chase offers touchid to see most information but correctly requires your password when you are performing operations with your money  otherwise someone could lift my print from anything and do anything with my cash if they got hold of my phone great work from a security conscious user,1still loving this app i got the latest iphone with touch id and it makes it nice not having to enter a password to use the app i can transfer money check my account balances pay bills etc whats not to lovelove this app and love chase i have  accounts all free just by making  purchases a month on my main business account love being able to make deposits remotely also love the ability to pay bills and to make transfers easily terrific app,1even though i am a chase customer and i am not a fan being that i was persuaded to do something with my money against my better judgement by one of their bank rep i realize that this review is only about their app the app works great for me i have managed my alerts and once you get that taken cared of the rest is really up to you i rely on info from the app but i also know that it is my responsibility to keep accurate counts on my debits and withdrawals,1although other reviews have mentioned transactions showing up late on their account i have not experienced this i made a payment over the phone recently and it showed up on my account within minutes i was still on the phone when i checked the account and was surprised how quick it appeared i also really like the ability to make transfers and to deposit without going to the bank,1i love the potential the app has compared to other apps in the current market i consider this one to be very up to date and always useful it uses fingerprint tech so its even more convenient theres so many in app features as welli use the app  times a week i love the layout of the app it could use a few enhancements however the fact its a very nice and convenient app i have resolved problems on here rather than calling customer support,1saves me a lot of time by not having to go to a local branch to deposit checks and complete a lot of basic banking tasks quick to transfer funds between accounts credit cards and to external thirdparty accounts great to review depositwithdraw images of checks on the go i find the account summary page that you can check without having to log in all the time useful,1i have been using this app since it was issued at first it had a few problems especially with depositing checks but they were cleared up rapidly i had some of the problems with difficulty and putting in a new payee but it has been cleared up too it is working well right now ive never had any troubles with security all in all its about the best one available and if there is a problem they will fix it,1there really hasnt been anything ive needed to do with my chase accounts that i havent been able to do using this appits extremely easy to use and does most everything one would need to do in regards to credit cards checkingsavings accounts and even monitoring investment accounts with the convenience of being in your pocket rather than needing to be accessed via laptop or computer desktop,1its nice being able to check your balance whenever you want but they seriously need to fix this password problem touch id randomly turns off for no flipping reason and it randomly make you reset your password because youve made too many attempts when i never even put in my password incorrectly and changing your password is no easy thing you need your social security number and your card number and you cant even use an old password if they just fix this problem would be perfect,1works ok for the most part i can see my checking usage and it updates debit card use pretty quick i have used chase pay a few times with no issue i can not search by check number here only scroll by date and by far the most annoying thing is that the touch id function every few days will not work and you have to re enter by password i have chosen a hard password so i cant get back into the app until i am home and use my lap top or re enter the password information that by far is the most annoying part,1after reading some of the other people reviews so far i havent had those issues to deal with i dont have issues with the app remembering my login id nor do i have an issue with switching from my imprint or changing to use my actual password so improvements can be made but its just an app for small information you may need quickly but if you need major banking needs then i suggest that you go online instead of using the app from your phoneyour phone can only do so much,1the chase app is a great app if you obviously already have a chase account the app lets you remotely login to your account from anywhere the chase quickpay is the best feature from the app which allows you to transfer or receive money from other chase accounts say your stuck at penn station and spent the last of your cash on  you can get some cash from a friend to get back home safe the only downside is that sometimes the app can lag or load time is long but thats pretty much it enjoy,0love the ease of the app once i am in but hate logging in it is constantly turning off my one touch for some reason and then i have to log back in manually however once i try to login it always tells me that i am out of attempts and it makes me change my password this happens probably about every two weeks then i have to go to the computer and think up a new password again with all its requirements are use the computer because the customer service told me that the mobile app will sometimes tell you the password doesnt meet the requirements even when it does its a pain,1dont know what id do without it gives me the opportunity to check my accounts pay bills transfer money anything i need to do  the most important feature of this app is the alerts i can keep track of every transaction that is over the limits ive set absolutely vital for fraud protection  i have had it save me a lot of grief in the past definitely a must in my daily life thank you chase still my most used app  star in my book,0i have the app to pay for my credit card all i want to do is pay my card the touch settings doesnt always work and when it doesnt i have to put in the password if u forget your password then your up for a treat because it is very hard to reset the password if you call customer support they tell you that you cant reset on your phone and they treat you like you are an idiot i hung up with them because they were not helping and i tried again on my phone and i was finally able to reset on my phone worst experience with a cardapp combo and customer service as soon as i pay this off am going to cancel this card horrible,1as another user mentioned i too get alerts for other peoples accounts i even called chase customer service and they told me there was nothing they could do it didnt show up on my account that i was getting these alerts and that it was most likely a problem with my carrier atampt reallyi just tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app to see if that fixes the problem well see  also the ipad version is fine  no problems thereupdate after uninstalling and reinstalling the app im still getting push notifications for someone elses account,1i am a pretty basic bank customer i only have a debit card a checking and a savingsi assume the negative reviews are from people who need more features than me i love this app it does everything i would need to do at a brickandmortar bank and if i have an issue the customer service numbers are built right in i recently moved to a chasefree area and i was considering switching banks until i got this i love the quick deposit feature,1its so easy to use features like the balance preview and now fingerprint id make it a breeze to do all the things that well should be a breeze plus its pretty  when im in atlanta i see pictures of the skyline on the login screen and when im in miami i see palm trees its seriously almost perfect the only thing i wish i could do is see pdf files of my monthly statements like on the desktop website but its not something that will take away from my five star rating,1i am very excited that chase just got on board with the biometrics thumbprint portion so that people with iphone s  and  plus can just put their thumb print on their phone to get into their bank account one less thing to make it easier to check your bank accounts and deposit checks i am also a big fan of the mobile check deposit i hope they would increase the daily and weekly limit but it is sufficient for now,1been using this app for quite awhile amp am extremely satisfied w functions of app amp ease of use only negative w room for improvement is alerts functionality when you view alerts you get days worth instead of just the last few  takes longer to load amp hey theres an alert history area you can view if needed also some alerts duplicate every single time  what a pill otherwise  hard pressed to find issues w this app well done overall chase,1i love depositing checks on the mobile chase the workers at the drivethru are terrific but the newly improved quick deposit beats the heat and traffic for this new retiree i had occasionally had problems with checks being accepted with  submissions required on a single check before success but all is well now with an added calculator letting me know if im near the daily max chase has listened and made life easier,1chase is super smart in the first place by partnering with apple in every way touch id login into your account put them over the top finally checking my app can literally be a quick and easy press and glance that cooped with the fact i can use apple id makes it the standard i love the extra security of having to enter your password to do transfers andor payments i do not write reviews for apps so my testimony here is credible in my own sense,1i have accounts with chase and bank of america i think the boa app is more advance than chase you can do a lot more with boa than chase a big problem for me right now with this chase app is that you cant view the checks for example that youve written when i see my statement i see that i made lets say check  for  but what if i cant remember who that was made to with the boa you can see a copy of that check chase i like your app and banks but we need to catch up with these other apps good luck,1something is screwy with the app  i deleted and added it back in but it will not offer me the touch id that out of the blue disappeared an hour ago whose yet i called chase and the person that i spoke to said that she had never heard of chase touch id   twilight zone  ive been using it every since it was offered months agoi did a restart on my telephone and still the vanished touch id will not make its presence known  it is noted as being a feature of chase on the internet but no easily found directions on how to add it,1this fantastic app is a dynamo of productivity saving me multiple trips to the bank each month as a gift to the world chase has delivered mindboggling convenience to mobile banking the ease of immediate bank deposits has not only saved me many many hours its saved me money in allowing me to secure my deposits before i lose my checks it also allows me to save my money more effectively through the ease of transferring from checking to savings thanks,1easy to use has any and all features that the full website does use it almost daily  would like to see the password request removed for certain options once youve already logged in via touch id i know this is extra measures of security but not really necessary and does away with the quickness of logging in via touch id other than that dont think it could get better without getting too complicated,1i think this app continues to get better and better  i love the easy access swipe in window that allows you to check balances quick without logging into your account i love the real time balances with pending items the pay it quick feature is another convenience feature for me i like the new feature of reviewing checks now in overall this is a very useful app thank you chase,1this app is so convenient ive been using it for a few months now amp i dont have any complaints its definitely made my life much simpler i can check my balance in a few seconds see my recent transactions make deposits accept and send transfers from fellow chase bankers and so much more im not sure what some reviewers are talking about with the alerts i find it easy to get to that section and i cant think of a better way for the app designers to do it love it love it love it,1i have found the app to be an awesome product on the iphone the alerts are easy to find for me just swipe down on the screen and go to notifications although it is no longer a new feature i love it that i can deposit checks from my couch at  am in the morning or transfer  to my sons spending account for college and see the balances of all of my accounts in one easy place i particularly love that the app has incorporated touch id,1this app is so easy to navigate and use i have a credit card with chase and this app is amazing for managing it i can pay my bills set up alerts and check my activity from one convenient place that i can access easily especially with the addition of the fingerprint scan instead of the actual password at any time of the day i absolutely love this app and i wish my other banks were so easy to use and navigate,1wonderful app for checking your bank balance and moving money between savings and checking accounts quick pay is a wonderful feature i use it all the time the only additions i would like to see in the app are   not require us to put in our password so many times when fingerprint technology is also being used  allow us to edit our personal information on the accountthe app is easy to use and intuitive i highly recommend it,1great update except for these  things the good morning good afternoon and good evening at the top of each screen is completely unnecessary and takes up close to  of the screen there should be an option to turn that greeting off or remove it completely from the app there needs to be more contrast between the line items that you can select and the negative space as of now the selections blend in too much with the background,1ive had the unpleasant experience of dealing with local banks in the past which i have learn a lesson from i will never use a local bank again  ive been denied loans because of family members bad credit  i make a very nice income for myself around  a year and have had to have a co signer for loans they these local banks   i needed a new car and chase was more than willing to help me without a co signer  their application is super easy to use other banks should take lessons,1when paying credit card you have three choices  the total amount of last statement  total balance and  other as i make periodic payments i would like to see the balance due on the statement as i go along chipping away at itwith that said i gave the app five stars as it is clear and i never have a problem with it i use quick pay pay bills and pay almost everything else  with my chase freedom card,1this is a fairly decent mobile credit app straightforward and easy to use it isnt clunky and bogged down by features its easy to make a payment or to check your balance one cannot viewmanage the rewards points by purchase only monthly my only other complaint is that even with touch id enabled you must enter your password to do anything other than view your current balance overall its relatively onpar with other mobile credit apps,0pretty poorly design app drives you crazy you cant navigate through the application easily application flow is not self explanatory one need to take time to familiar with chase banking in order to use it freely i have almost  different credit cards from different banks this is the most difficult app to use it wont even lets you enable your auto payments before due date just due to the poorly designed application i avoid to use chase credit card to stay away from application my recommendation would be take a look at the discover amex or bofa application chase will surely find a lot useful to implement cheers,1im a newbee to chase and i love all the features but have a few simple request when i get alerts that i have a deposit why doesnt it have any sound like other text messages next request is why doesnt points on chase freedom update as i earn them just like checking shows automatically when you make a payment to my freedom card ive looked at points several times and keeps showing same thing over and over all in all app is great and so easy to use thank you chase,1very easy to use log in and log out are a breeze the mobile check deposit is awesome and the checks are usually posted to your available balance within an hour or two transaction history is accurate and easy to navigate overall i dont think you really need anymore that what the chase app already provides to effectively and efficiently keep track of your bank account,1it does everything you need its simple and professional you can deposit checks and transfer money between accounts from the app i havent had to go to the bank or open the browser for anything other than realworld transactionsalso i love that you can use touchid because i hate how complicated my password had to be  and at least i know its secure to whomevers fingerprints i allow very good app and very easy to use,1the fingerprint security prompt signin is frequently slow or fails to load the prompt requiring a close out and relaunch but it usually works the second time  i would also prefer that the mobile app had the same abilities that a connection via ethernet desktop pc did       my time is my most precious commodity these days and i often want to be able to accomplish on the run during a rare andor unplanned respite but the mobile app lacks some of the needed functionality,1i love this app easy to manage the only reason i didnt give it  stars is the difficulty sometimes in taking a picture of a check to deposit the other banks i deal with but not my main account are scanning the check and that results in very little effort on my part its so quick and fast that the deposit is almost effortless i have times on the chase account that i need to retake the photo or it says hold still it can be frustrating thats all i need for a  star review,1im very satisfied with this app its very user friendly fast please note im using an iphone s and concise in terms available options for a mobile device additionally it has been very ideal for checking statements and paying bills the only part i havent found on the app yet unless it is not available is how to manage the ultimate rewards section still this is a small detail compared to the overall convenience of the app,1i love the chase app because its easy and cool however the freedom credit account balance and charges take so long to get updated and the money transfer to my credit card online takes days when over the phone the balance gets updated right after the transfer also i cant see the chase freedom points in between the cycles so i need to wait to see my points until the cycle is over the check deposit feature is not very responsive and i ended up giving up using it because of too many errors,1chase mobile app is amazing for anyone with any chase accounts it is extremely easy to navigate keep tabs on your account transfer money between accounts pay your chase credit card and set personalized notifications for your account transactions all of which i personally do i love this app because it keeps me organized and i can check anything about my accounts at any time highly recommended,1i have been with chase for  years over this time period they have done a superb job with online banking now with mobile app i do most of banking on this app very convenient and user friendly i use most of the features and now using quick pay which i love it   one suggestion  i think fingerprint recognition for login would make it more convenient  other banking apps are using now and login is much easier ,1this app is awesome well developed super easy to use i do everything via the app to manage my credit card and make payments whenever i want love it makes you feel you have control of your spending no surprises of charges you forgot about or didnt know happened thanks to the mobile alerts you can set my car lease is also through chase and it automatically synced to the app chase is awesome and the only credit card i use,1ive never had any major problems to date using the chase app its extremely convenient and the user interface is simple and straightforward i look forward to future enhancements to this appjune  i continue to love the chase app for iphone easy to use and i appreciate the consistent app updates i would like to see touch id enabled for the app it was an update feature before but it looks like you cannot enable touch id to log in,1i love this app it has made banking truly easy amp convenient for me i dont have to waste my time amp gas to go to the bank or write checks amp mailing them it has all the features that i need to check balances deposit transfer money pay bills etc thank you chase for making banking a stress free amp customer friendly experience every time of course theres always room for improvement but i cant think of anything right now,1i have three credit cards with chase and i love the way i can get in my email both reminders and confirmations of payment it is also helpful that i can choose the actual due date for payment and schedule it to be transferred from my bank on that date and not be considered late i also find it very helpful that i can see the transactions as soon as they occur in summary the convenience of this app is amazing,1over the past year there have been some good updates and a complete rework of this app it keeps getting better checking account and credit card questions that most consumers ever encounter can be handled with this app november  ive used this app for several years with successive updates it seems to work better and have fewer bugs ive found it useful for basic personal banking services,1i really like using chase online when it works but just like many others i have an problems with depositing checks i like others cant understand why would it take me through the whole process only to tell me its not working try again or go to the bank also i cant understand why we canpay billsdeposit checkswhen available amp not giving you a hard timemove money between accounts pay others and receive money through quick pay which isnt all that quick but cant set up an automatic withdrawal to savings account through the app desktop or on the phone it doesnt make sense that i can do all of the above and cant set up an automatic withdrawal to my chase savings account i definitely like the idea of the app but i wish they would fix the hiccups and really make things as easy as they say it is,0would love to have the ability to view rapid rewards balanceactually it is a must the technology and functionality are very limited app needs to be updated drastically to compete with some of the competitors apps i have a credit card with discover and with capitalone and you are able to do so much more you can check your credit score weekly make multiple payments per day and you are able to view realtime activity which is huge they are also user friendly and more appealing to the eye please take suggestions into consideration i honestly just expect more from such a large company,1i like the background pictures here like that i can access all of my accounts through the app pay my bills and transfer funds like the full site can you return to sending direct deposit alerts i miss getting the text messages telling me what i got paid and its driving me bats asking me to write a review ive submitted the same thing and now have added this im good its a great app stop asking me to write a review,1ive been using this app for years now and havent experienced any of the issues mentioned with touch id or transfers i have several accounts with other banks and i have to say that chase seems to be ahead of the curve especially when it comes to alerts and security there is so much you can do with this app but like any other app it takes some exploration to become familiar with the navigation,1the app works fine on my phone but it isnt formatted to use on my ipad pro which is my main machine for bill paying that was disappointing to me i tend not to use my phone for such things because i do all my financial things at home on my own network and not in public wifi places where stuff can get looked at by anyone in the place most other financial apps have phone apps just for checking balances etc but to actually move money around you use their full site not chasethis is it  so on the ipad it shows up as a giant phone app,0touch id is not working properly while working with all other apps on my phone including other banking and credit card apps the chase app doesnt recognize it requires password entry only gives you two attempts then locks the account then it requires a new password which almost guarantees that the next time this repeats you need more than two attempts to remember it biometric id south as touch is the safest way so its not understandable why the app would require you to frequently resort to passwords  other apps dont have this issue  why this one this us annoying and in need of some examination and fix,1first and foremost this is the leading bank app out of all the banks that have ever offered an app this one truly supports its customers and the app is updated pretty regularly leading to a smooth flow of opening and using the app i like the security features and i enjoy the fact that i can set how much i want to be notified and be informed of how much was spent based on limits that you can select in the app if your trying to save money this app helps you see exactly where every filler you earn and spend goes,0if youre getting this app for the sole purpose of using the mobile deposit thanks againthe mobile deposit feature is a very hit or miss situation sometimes still work without a flaw and plenty of times where it will state that the image quality is not good enough so you cannot deposit it when in fact the quality of the image is perfect nothings interfering with the account numbers or anything ill be sitting here trying to deposit a check over  times and that is when you say that its insanityi suggest chase invest in a little bit of time on getting it right,0live on the west coast went to pay my bill which is due on the first at pm pacific time right after i got off work turns out it was due by am eastern time and so therefore even though it is still the first on the west coast its late at  eastern what kind of garbage policy implementation is that chase im not asking for a few days grace period im asking for it to be the first in all of america before you go saying the payment is late its not about the fee its about the principal of saying my payment is lye even though its still the first in over half the united states cant wait to pay off this balance and go back to only using my amex bye felicia,0ive had chase for a bank for  years now part of the reason i love them is because of all the things you can do online i havent had to go into a physical bank in over  years probably the problem is this app only works about half the time the other half of the time i try to open it it says were sorry we cannot currently connect to chase not that exactly but something along those lines and it wont even let me login so when its working sure its great i just wish it was working all the time and i didnt have to constantly delete and redownload the app,1this is probably the best banking app i have ever worked with everything with this app works wonderfully with someone that is needing to get things done on a daytoday basis i am able to take care of all transactions and items that i need to take care of without ever having to step into a branch the only problem that i have with this app is that the touch id always seems to go out and you have to put in your password but it says that the password is incorrect and you have to do it a whole new password this happens on a weekly basis so that is a nuisance,1dont put drop downs on the signin page  cluttered looking and on a mobile screen i dont want to click it accidentally  i see it as a second access point for evil doersi dont like the recent change in account summary displays  theres no way to adjust the view so i see the top two accounts i use most frequentlyif youre going to change make the changes even more helpful than what youre dumping  id hit the undo button if i could on this last rollout,1i love the chase app  i am able to do most of my banking right through the app  the only complaint i have has to do with the alerts  when a push alert is sent to your phone and you log in and check alert history it displays a default card or account  i wish they would configure the app to display the most recent alert then i can toggle if i want to see any more  i usually dont have much time i want to get right to what i want to look at,1i enjoy this app cause its easy to use and its keep me on point about my bank statements and checks and i can always get my available balance in seconds one of the best bank apps i love this app love the updates what can be done to improve this app is when u purchase something from the internet or from itunes or a game that the money should come off right away so that u know exactly what ur balance is,1ive used the chase mobile app for years and use boas app for a nonprofit the chase app works fine except for two annoyances associated with depositing checks online one im reminded to take a picture of the back of each and every every check i deposit duh cant there be a popup notice when a user hits the submit button  the reminder popup makes me feel like a customer whos depositing checks for the first time in their life or an idiot who has to be constantly reminded that there are two sides to a checktwo pressing the shutter button to snap a photo boas app automatically snaps the photo once the check is framed within tolerance very handy feature i would have contacted chase directly about this but there is no contact us about improving the app that i can find so im posting here other than what i mentioned its a  star app,1all of the mobile banking features seem to work well so far  was surprised though that the atm locator only returned one location  problem  this atm is located in the lobby of a private employer in its own building on its own suburban campus with a security guard and key card entry  not someplace id want to have to go to use a bank machine   it should return several locations instead  maybe then i can choose the most accessible one based on traffic on my way easy access etc,1easy to setup simplistic design though it just loads an iphone webpage within the app limited to just a few recent transactions and credit cards do not display balance last statement rather displaying only current balance and minimum payment this piece of information is highly desired and unable to be reached in appi hope they update it to include all the information available via chase online and integrate it with the iphone features more than just building a web page within an app,0so the notion of this app prompted an immediate download  i have a rental property amp get rent checks from the renters   problems with the app as it relates to my main reason for getting the app  the daily limit is so low  only   if youre making remote deposits chances are good youre going to need to deposit more than  so because of the daily limit i have to deposit rent checks on differnt days super annoying  today tried to deposit one for  have not depositied any for about a month amp was told that the amout was too high for the quick deposit feature  would have to go to branch  tried x amp got the same message  in addition it asks for your dollar amount st  i had to go through the whole pciture taking process etc before it rejected me  sooooo annoying  mostly annoying because its not doing the basic task that it promises to  if it worked amp did what it said it does i would give it  or  stars but right now is unreliable,1i have my mortgage amp cc through chase unfortunately in sc there is no chase banks i cannot schedule a future pmt on this appl for my mortgage or cc the pmt gets posted right away amp only for the cc if i need to ck status of my pmt it doesnt provide any info u cant trnsf funds frm an outside acct to this one can only do it through my laptop  so think for people who have business wchase but there no banks in the state u live the same figures available on the web version should be available on the mobile one otherwise what was the purpose on creating this app chase u need to wrk on this,0i used this app constantly to make online deposits transfers etc it worked flawlessly for probably a year  now its so unreliable i almost cant even use it im considering switching banks last two times i tried to make online deposits it wouldnt go through  today it just kept saying it was ok even though it obviously wasnt going through when i tried again after logging out and back in it said that a  check was too big for an online depositsomeone better stabilize this thing or chase will lose a customer with a bunch of money sitting in their account,1for the most part this app works fine for checking and paying off balance the thing that irks the crap out of me is the alert history each time i have a new alert it would bring back all the old alert history even after i check all the history the total count returns im currently at  alert history please fix this at this point im not even paying attention to the alert history but i might end up missing important notifications,1this is a great banking app i dont understand why people complain about updates  you push a button it updates  people having problems must have other phone related problems as i know no one that has ever had issues with an update my whole family uses it  what would be great to see it the ability to set and teak budgets categorize spending and generate reports    desktop access would be awesome if you could print checks at home,1always love a refresh and update and im very pleased with this one new interface is very elegant and welcomedas a credit card only chase customer i cannot speak to the banking features but find the credit features very useful and helpfulwish list for future update includes three main items first ability to select specific a statement period when viewing transaction activity analogous to the chase website instead of just seeing a continuous list of everything with no discernible breaks second add ability to remember login password or add the use of a four digit pin login instead of having to enter password every time paypal recently added a pin option that is very very nice lastly add ability to redeem rewards points within the appgreat work keep it up,1i have used the last several versions of the chase app and this is the best version they could possibly have come up with i have used the wells fargo app once or twice in the past and it is one of the most pathetic apps any banking institution has ever published i stopped using wells fargo altogether solely based on how poorly their app was designed i now exclusively use chase for all of my banking needs because their app is so fully functional and easy to use,1the app is very user friendlyeasy to access and use i love the ability to add bills pay bills see all of my deposit and credit card accts redeem my credit card rewards take pictures of my checks for deposit and request and send money to friends and family even if they dont have an acct with chase the security of the site is excellent without being too much of a burden on the user,1i have banked with chase for  yearsthis app has been the perfect compliment as i have traveled and lived in states where chase does not operate i have been able to continue banking and not have to switch banks solely because of this app and it continues to get better one of the first to be able to make deposits from your home on your app clean very user friendly able have accounts mortgage etc all in one place life made simple chase what matters,1i have nothing but amazing things to say about chase ever since i opened my account over yrs ago they have taken care of me i have used this app to its fullest extent from quickpay to mobile check deposits i have never encountered any problems their customer service is top notch and everything is so seamless i recommend chase to any of my friends and family who are looking at either switching banks or needing specific services,0iosiphone i download the new update of chase app per requested when i was doing mobile banking as usual  everything went well when i first opened it after downloaded  i logged out and tried to relogin and i did get in but just froze on the first page  i cannot scroll down logout or go anywhere  it froze  i closed the app relaunched it but result is the same stuck on the first page not moving  chase did not give me the option of refusing the update  its either you update or give up on chase mobil banking     i hope chase fix it soon  ps since im still using iphone  i dont think i will upgrade to ios with it specially with various problems with ios,1i can say now that the chase app is perfect im the person that checks my account at least once a day and the new fingerprint feature makes it easier for me to do so i also use many other features like paying my boyfriend my half of the bill money can easily be transferred into his account and when i get a check in the mail i wasnt expecting i can deposit it without leaving my bed i love chase and i love my  chase app,1the mobile app for chase banking is incredibly easy and convenient it isnt hard to navigate and anything i need to take care of i can on there its saved me a couple times when i didnt realize how little i had while trying to pay for something and had to make a transfer i highly recommend it for anyone who is constantly on the move and doesnt have time to use their website,1the app works very nicely the recent change to the look helped if you need readers normally to see text thanks for the larger fonts however showing current and pending cc new balances in cc activity would make this app  starswaiting + days to see the posted payments even within app transfer between accounts is difficult to keep an eye on your total balance when you need to know right away for on going purchases ok,1i bank with several different banks and chase by far has the best app i have several different accounts with them and its very easy to navigate around and do things like transfer money or pay or set up automatic payments or view a credit card statement they also include your account history which is very nice to be able to take a look several years back at your account statements,1love the new user interface that shows a picture of my citys skyline nice personal touch chaseive used several banking apps and this is clearly the best one on the market i do all my banking on my mobile app and barely go into the branch any longer depositing checks paying bills and transferring money has never been easier  also love quick pay makes it so easy to send friends money to cover dinner or happy hour,1im a business owner and im pretty much on my phone all day long im very app savy  im literally on the chase app before my feet hit the floor every morning and i love it   i have only one minor complaint which is that i cannot change my account when doing a quick pay transaction i am forced to do all kinds of crazy transfers between accounts to end up where i need to be  upgrades come frequently so im hoping ill see it fixed sometime soon,1i love most of the app and it has gotten better my only complaint is having to put in your password to do a transaction after you got in with your fingerprint other banking apps let you do all transaction after entering it with your fingerprint why have a quick way in if you still have to use your password you have the easy way to check balances without going into the appfabulous but now the fingerprint basically does what swiping to the right does dont get it,1i dont think the person who wrote about big banks amp always a horrible experience understands the purpose of this review but i digress the app is great i can use it to simply check my balance or make deposits amp transfer funds without leaving my bed i can set notifications which help me better monitor activity ive used apps from small banks like mainsource i forgot my password amp they would not help me recover or renew it i had to delete the app forever this is a winner,1i dont know what id do without my chase app it makes my life so much easier i used to have to go to the bank all of the time to deposit checks or pay my rent but with quick pay and being able to take pictures of the checks i never have to wait in lines also the ability to transfer money between my accounts and make payments to my credit card on the app has also made my life so much easier,1this ap provides all the information i need to track purchases credits payments due and payments made its easy for me to access even though the touch id gets a little sketchy from time to time the only thing missing is a free fico score  barclays bank provides one on their mobile app and i think it would be gracious for chase to do the same sadly i havent found chase to be gracious about anything so im not holding out a lot of hope for a fico,1i dont have to type in my password my fingerprint is suffice it is pretty easy to use i do credit card payments as well as personal bill payment through here i dont have to go through the hassle of making payments through many different websites i set up bill pay once and thats it quick pay is my go to when i cant pay my friends back in cash because i never carry any i just quick pay,1this app is very easy to use and atheistically nice love that it gives you an option to preview your balance without having to login fully and the touch id login option provides the ease to quickly get into your account without having to stop and type your password when youre on the go my only qualm is the atmbranch finder option isnt that great it would be nice if it linked up with googlemaps right in the app rather than switching out,1i dont normally rate things as commonplace as a bank app generally speaking if you have the bank youre kind of just stuck with using whatever software they have available but this up is actually really solid it is a lot of really great features the big banking is here logging into your account feel secure and safe and gives you a easy way to look over your accounts well done chase now just dont collapse the economy,1the chase app is easy to use and gives you access to most of the functionality found on the chase website it wont provide you with more detailed information like your account numbers but you can transfer money check your statements and even deposit checks its very convenient and implements iphone features such as touch id into its functionality a musthave for chase accountholders,1cant believe chase took so long to add touch id support in the first place  then when they add it the only thing you can do is view your account balances any other action like balance transfers bill pay etc all require your password to be entered which totally defeats the convenience and frankly better security of touch id please revisit this guys ill be leaving chase soon for etrade if you do not  they know how to do balance transfers instantly whereas you take  hours or more and they allow touch id to be your one key needed for all functionality,1chase has always been my first choice when banking this app makes my favorite bank even more special i never have to worry when if someone uses my phone because this app logs me out if i forget i dont even have to use the computer anymore because nearly all the features this app has applies to the computer version as well great tech support if i have questions needed answering immediately chase is the way to go,1i really like the chase app but its flaws drive me crazy the biggest flaw is the message center and alerts they have never loaded for me after i get a notification on my phone that a message is available this is why i am giving the app  stars instead of  other than that the app is great gives you great control of your money and allows you to manage your bills right from within the app really hope they fix the message center issues,1i dont understand all the previous negative reviews ive been using the app since they launched and i am very pleased i am pleased with the improved functionality the app makes my life convenient i love that i can see all of my accounts in preview i love i can see and email my statements i love that i can transfer between my business and personal accounts i love the quickpay feature cmon folks overall this is a great app can please everyone i guess,1i just love chase bank this app makes it easy for me when i lived in dallas chase was the closest bank now i live in arkansas which doesnt have any chase banks now the chase app is my lifeline to my money i can deposit my checks online personal and company checks and the withdrawals are quick so i know exactly how money i have the transfer of funds is very simple the whole app is easy to navigate through i wont use any other banking service,1its a banking app and it does everything i need it to do im sure there are some features that could be added and improved on but i have never found myself frustrated while using this app well maybe but that is because i would like more  in my account but no fault with chase on that one the fact that i can pay bills transfer money deposit checks send money to a friend and so much more makes this bank and app work for me two thumbs up,1the chase app has everything i need except for when you want to search for an atmbranch they give you the results listed by distance in miles from where you are now i usually have to stop by the bank on my way to another place so miles away from me is really relevant i need to be able to see where all the search results are on one map it would also be really helpful if they added an info line that stated located within vons if was an atm inside of a building otherwise i drive there and im thinking okay wheres the atm,1i love this app it is easy to use  i can check my accounts and pay bills easily  i have it on my phone and ipad i love the new look as well only thing is that sometimes when i try to make a deposit on the app it wont let me to me it isnt a deal breaker i can just go to bank and deposit if it doesnt work other than that i think its great i changed over from boa about  years ago and i am so glad i did chase is way better,1this app is amazing so easy to use and easy to move around i love the new upgrade with the chase quickpay i dont have to worry about people accepting or me receiving money the only thing i have a hard time doing is finding transactions i would like some type of search bar to look for a transaction if there is one i havent seen it maybe i will look into it but if there isnt one it would be nice to have other than that its great i love chase in general and the app makes things even better,0edit and now touch id is no longer an option to sign in whats going on chase it had been updated so that touch id logged you in for everything which is how it should be  but now for some reason thats gone  frustrating which is something common with chase these days in general original review its great that they finally added touch id to the app but if i actually want to do anything transfer money see my statements etc i still need to enter my password so it adds a step rather than simplifies things touch id is more secure than a password not less let me log in with touch id and do what i need to do this is needlessly complicated otherwise a good app,1i love the features of the app quickpay account preview amp online check deposits are great for me the touch id keeps locking me out of my account after opening my account a couple of times using touchid it will then indicate wrong password afterwards when i enter my password manually it tells me im locked out i have to keep calling customer service to unlock my account this feature needs to be fixed i have an iphone  but this also happened with my iphone ,1i love this app it allows me to stay informed about my financial life great job on creating it  i do like the deposit part of it its so convenient sometimes it may not take the check but i think its more operational error in taking the picture one must remain over the check otherwise it will be too blurry and wont let the check deposit but if you are patient and do it right it works thanks chase for making life easier,1this app allows me to do everything i need directly from my phone transfers payments checking my accounts my statementsthe only  negatives are the apple id signin bugs sometimes there has been improvements but there are still situations where it doesnt show up and i have to manually enter my credentials  it would be nice to access my travel center and manage my trips from the app or maybe another one i havent seen this feature,1i like all the features and the functionality is pretty good the one thing that bothers me is that i cannot see my fico credit score i track my credit often to make sure everything is good but i cant get that information on this app i know that bank of america and citibank offer it in their app its almost  i shouldnt have to log into my computer in order to check up on my credit score come on chase step it up for  get ys that fico score option on this app,1i love this app its very intuitive and easy to use so it makes managing money a lot simpler   mobile deposit has worked with  of the checks i have tried huge time savings  overall its what makes me most satisfied with my decision to go with chase bank i can actually keep up with payments no annoying paper in the mail and instantly transfer money where it needs to go when i receive a paycheck,1really who wants to keep recipes for all their purchases to reconcile their credit card account if you could upload photos of your receipt for each purchase that would be awesome what about listing next to a transaction at a vendor a note for what was purchased for instance i go to lowes frequently and dont remember each transaction but if i snapped a photo of my reciept attached it to the charge on my card and listed new saw i would easily reconcile my account i would know it wasnt fraudulent and keep receipts handy for returns now thats service,1i refer to this app pretty often its very easy to use i am not always within an area of a chase bank branch so having the ability to complete all of my banking needs by using this app is a huge plus this app gives me the ability to check balances pay bills transfer funds send funds to familyfriends and deposit checks all without having to make the time to physically go find a bank,1it is so wonderful to be able to have access to your bank accounts on your phone however this app cannot do everything that you can do on their regular website yet so sometimes you have to go to your computer to take care of certain things but they have been taking care of improving the app so that it almost does everything that the regular website does plus you can sign in on your iphone with touch id which is really cool,1love it big reason why im with chase is there slick app some reviewers complain about wasted space when you first open the app that space is reserved if you have multiple chase accounts like credit cards savings accounts etc its great being able to see all of my accounts in one space pay bills transfer money to friends deposit checks add pays all in one easy to use app literally no complaints,0i had an amex and i decided to give chase an opportunity for the only thing this trial was helpful was to put in perspective my amex experience and comeback to this company to be my principal credit card chase definitely have a way to go the experience of the app is poor useful information missing and sometimes not very clear i had to spent a lot of time over the phone asking questions the fact that chase doesnt offer every day deals is also not inviting i even find my bofa app more useful than the chase one hope you could find a good balance for your app and deliver more quality,0very poor compared to the bank of america app  mainly for two reasons  the app refuses frequently checks for deposits even printed checks from chase itself and each and every time it is then no problem at all to deposit the check to bank of america  between taking the pictures of front and back of a check the iphone has to be repositioned which makes it impossible to use a stand for the iphone for these deposits with bank of america taking the pictures is anyway much much much better as the app itself decides to shoot when the check is in a good position,0this app was ok at best and with every update it seems to get worse  if you just wanna check balances then its good for that  mobile depositing checks is hit and miss and after several attepmpts you have to just go to the bank  the fingerpring option was never an option on the ipad and now it seems they have taken it away on the iphonewell at least for me on the +  why would you take a feaure like that awayon a side note currently looking for another bank in the atlanta area because chase branches are scarce  they took over washington mutual and never invested in any locations or stand alone atms,1this is a great banking app when it works but sometimes for no apparent reason the touch id stops being available and i have to sign in using my password and turn on the touch id again ive also had it happen that neither the touch id nor my password works and it tells me ive tried to sign on too many times and it locks me out  when i am able to sign in its very easy to use except half the time the deposit checks function doesnt work so in conclusion when it works its a great app but when it doesnt argh,1ive been using this app since it first came out and i have not had one bad experience yet the app is very easy to use its incredibly secure with accessing it especially if you havent opened it in a while one of my favorite features is the quickpay sending to anyone else with chase for zero fee i wouldnt want to bank with any other place i tried and their appwebsites just couldnt live up to chase i highly recommend,0this review is specific to check deposit function   it can work great and be a good convenience vs driving to bank branch but often times i have to retake my pictures multiple times no matter what the background is or lighting conditions are it sometimes refuses to accept my photos which are very clear to my eyes one time i had to retake pics over  times before the they were satisfactory   it can be extremely aggravating and the app makes you reenter the check amount and retake both pics every time no matter which pic was deemed not clear enough this adds to the pain,1i have been using the chase app now for about four months and have not had any issues whatsoever  i believe its accurate precise and timely i use the touch id and use it for both my businesses and personal accounts  i have not had one issue with any feature when reading all the previous reviews i was really skeptical so im not sure if its the operator or the phone being used i have an iphone  and it works great,1nice work chase you made some improvements that addressed my main issue ability to see actual deposited checks thank you this app saves me tons of time keep adding featuresps accessing my chase account via my desktop has become very difficult i am often unable to login so im very happy to have this mobile app which always seems to work chase needs to get your desktop situation improved,1the chase banking app is an excellent resource for keeping tabs on your account making transactions and basically any and all of your regular banking needs intuitive and easy to use the user experience is well thought out would recommend anyone with a chase account to get the app and take charge of their account with the tools provided within the app other banks need to take note and catch up,1chase app is just the right medicine for young busy professionals who need to know what there money is doing at any time any place and in any transition i feel like jesus christ yes jesus christ could have really used this app after praying healing teaching and preaching he would have been able to make sure the donations cleared so he could have moved to the next town assured all was well with the financial side of life sorry judas  but with the chase app in the st century you might have been obsolete,1like the topic says it works kinda when i review a as in one transaction the app proceeds to log me out then i have to log back in to do the whole process over the reason why other people say it doesnt work with the update is because since the software has been overwritten it is nolonger recognized all you need to do is reactivate your mobile account and it should work well at least it did for me but you then you may have the problem that im having right now with it logging you out in the middle of a session,1i just did my first deposit using the iphone s highres camera and it worked beautifully  that plus paying all your bills and doing transfers easily make this app a winner  the only thing i can ask for is push notifications for instant activities on my accounts  id rather have that than emails which can be rather slow,1the check deposit is amazing  it worked well it was a pain to install though  i was getting a need to update screen and it looked like the install didnt work  i spent  minutes on the phone with chase they had no clue  i finally went to the edit screen on the phone removed the app deleted it from itunes then did a fresh install  it did not work when i tried to delete it from itunes alone i had to delete it from the phone first,1along with my own accounts my familys accounts i also handle a few other accounts ive had the app for each one and this is by far the best one the amount it saves me on gas by not having to drive to the bank to deposit a measly  check is great i just take the picture and its set i love that the only complaint i have is that i wish it would read hand written checks a bit better otherwise its a joy,1i have an iphone s the chase update works absolutely fine on my phone i also have the most recent ios  update im assuming that most of these angry posts are from people who either didnt update their phone or have an older iphone no reason to get all mean in the reviews though a simple i have an iphone g and the update isnt functional would suffice anyways this chase app still works just as it did previously for me,0this was one of the best bank apps id ever useduntil the last update there is no longer a way to see your running balance in your accounts why take away features this is a major issue  now i am forced to go to the website to see which transactions have come through to date to account for the balance shown no transactions are shown  unbelievable there is no point to the app if i have to go to the full website anyway this is enough to force me to switch banks as i do all my banking from my phone it might be different if it never had the feature before but to remove major functionality boggles the mind,1as the title states this is a bit of an upgrade of the previous app to look more like it belongs in the latest iphone version  the previous app was good enough  theres more fluff in this version  not sure i seeing good evening makes me want to use chase any more or less  still some features that would be nice to have but i understand the security issues inherent in certain transactions and this it will be a while before those are included if ever  not bad though jp,1i like the new version of the mobile app the only thing i like to have added is to make changes to personal information on the mobile site and that the site will also recognize my home computer i can never log in with any computer i know its a safety feature and they send an email but by the time i get the email it is the next day and im at work and i like to stress that the text message setting doesnt work at all i have it set up for text but never get a text,1the simplicity in which you can use this app is great one place to deposit your checks and also pay bills online easily accessible from any point with wifi or with your own internet service the best thing about the app is the alert settings you can set up preferences for whatever amounts and how often if you have multiple accounts with chase you have one place to manage all of your accounts,1the app has worked great for me recently updated to ios  and the app has responded beautifully to it as a tool i use the app on the go to see what i have available and receive my true balance unlike some other bank apps that show you a balance and available unfortunately its never the actual balance the basics you need to do are awesome with the app and anything more i got the website to handle most of my requests,1this is a good app for anyone who has a chase bank account with that said i do wish chase would activate fingerprint access instead of having to manually enter a password  i have this functionality with other financial apps and it is far more convenient to actively monitor your accounts  imo fingerprint access is also more secure as people cant look over your shoulder while you enter your password  when chase adds this functionality to their app i will update my rating to  stars,1i pretty much only use the app to check my balance and do the occasional quick pay it works great for my needs and the new feature that lets you check your balance without having to sign in was a life saver i wish functionality for touchid or a pattern sign in could be added so i didnt have to type my password every time however thats a small complaint and for the most part this app works great for me,1update down to a  star from a  so disappointing that there is still no touchid this needs to happen sooner rather than lateri have never experienced any prolonged problems with this app and it has functioned well for years in comparison to some of other banking apps however this one seems to lag behind in features the biggest part that i am waiting on is touchid login all of the other banking apps i have utilize tid for login and chase needs to follow suit other than that solid banking app,1i have used several different banking apps and i have to say the chase mobile app is the best one  chase is so good at constantly releasing new updates and technology to make my banking easier   the only thing i hope they come out with is to be able to see my credit score via the app  i know the credit score on the slate card just came out but i hope its a feature in the apps later updates    stars for chase and the chase app,1the app is comprehensive yet remains very userfriendly it covers anything you would want or need to do on a computer including making andor scheduling payments checking on or claiming rewards and even has easy and quick links to call chase for a live person to assist you no need to look up a number each transaction is immediately posted for verification and tracking too five stars  for convenience,1they just added a fingerprint sign in which was my only complaint when they were lacking it  i use this daily to check my balance and transfer money super easy from my iphone  they also send you alerts optional if your balance goes below a certain amount  which helps avoid being overdrawn  you can set your own limit wouldnt change anything now that they have fingerprint sign in,1i am so impressed with this app i used to have an account with another bank their app was nowhere near as convenient as the chase app i am so thankful that chase gives its customers time to deposit money into checking accounts if the account becomes negative before charging a fee i also enjoy the account preview feature that can be used with the chase app i have absolutely no complaints about this app or chase bank thank you chase,1i love that you have heard your customers and made this app more user friendly the only thing that has changed is i dont always get my updates and notifications i receive two direct deposits a month but for some reason i only receive one notice also it would be nice to know if anything is pending against my account or if anyone else has requested to see information on my accountactivity but all in all i love it,1having this app on my iphone is a necessity as it allowed me to login and access my full chase account without it i would be stuck because logging in from a browser on my mobile device is impossible otherwise because they requesting multiple passwords and new codes for security and no matter what type it does not recognize this device the app at least remembers my password and works,1like the touch id and the account balance preview my only complaint is when i get an alert and go into the view alerts screen it always takes me to the first account in the list even if theres no alert on that account its most often on the rd or th account in the list so i have to go to the list of accounts and then guess which account the alert is on would be nice if when you touch view alerts it took you right to the account with the alert,1most functionalities work really well  as if you are at an atm  quick and pretty seamless  the check deposit functionality still seems a bit stuck in the s  for some reason on all the chase apps that have picture capabilities this ink etc their software dumbs down the image to the point where its hard to read  for both an end user needing to retrieve said image as well as their own system  check deposit works about  of the time,1chase continues to improve their app and general services they offer more and more to meet your needs the integration of touch id is so much more convenient getting information on the go is so essential so i dont know how you could live without this app only thing id like to see improved is their message center that has less to do its their app than it does with a general process annoyance good stuff though highly recommend,1i really loved the last update glad to see biometrics included i wish chase would expand the notifications to include all deposits not just electronic funds transfers its also middle of the pack when it comes to functionality i cant schedule pending transactions  which would help me keep a balanced budget other apps also allow bill pay options that import balances due which cuts out the additional set of logging into bill websites to see the amount due fix that and you get  stars from me,1ive been with chase for  years or so now and i love them this app has really come in handy for a quick view of my accounts easy amp fast check deposits simple account transfersand convenient access to find the closest atm or branch plus their quick view feature is great for an immediate glance at your account balancesoverall if you bank with chase you are banking right definitely recommend having the app ,1while i too am against big banks i have been a chase customer for a really long time and the local people have made me feel like i am using a small town bank the service from the personal and business bankers has been wonderful and this app to me is an extension of that customer service it is easy to use i love the fingerprint touch id and i am able to do  of my banking including deposits from this app,1this is a good app lots of features very stable it would be a great app if touchid authentication would allow one to transfer money or pay bills instead i have to enter my password manually after already authenticating in the same session this means i cant use a strong random password and have to resort to one i can remember which is less secure than just using touchid for full authentication chase developers please remove this restriction with that it would easily get  stars from me,1i have been a customer of chase bank since they bought out bank one in  i have used the app on my phone since it became available i use it almost daily to check my accounts monitor alerts deposit checks and more it is easy to use and offers every function i need and much more i also have had excellent service from chase i will always be thankful for their great support when i was a victim of id theft im a fan,1i have been using the chase app for a few years its been very helpful for mobile bankingi use it extensively for bill payments on the gothe bill payments feature has an issue when writing the memocomments the auto complete and text deletion isnt working as expected and also the switching numbers to alphabets has occasional problemsthe payment is made successfully however the bug with the memo field is annoying,1easy to use the functionality of button placement makes sense and i can check my balance and pay my cc in no time my only qualm is that i always get alerts and messages in my message center and the number gets higher this is mostly because i do chase quick pay transactions when i click on it in the app though nothing ever shows up ever i always have to do that online it bugs me to see a red numbers stating i have x messages but arent allowed to check them,1the app is incredibly easy to use in regards to checking my account and sendingreceiving money from family when were unable to meet in personthe only improvement id like to add is maybe adding a feature to view bank statements  this couldve saved me a trip to the bank when i needed a copy of my statement to change the address on my drivers license a few weeks ago  aside from that its a great app ,1i am a young adult still in transition and still figuring out how to navigate through adult life and learning how to pay bills  in full and on time this app helps me keep track of all my transactions savings credit and when to pay my bills very useful and easy to use the chase app makes paying bills extremely easy and fast i would recommend this to anyone who has a chase account,1maybe its because i dont have the iphone  like all these angry reviewersi love this app it is simple to use and makes complete sense for bank users who werent born into a generation that expects your app to think for you the app does what it says it will  its reliable which is so important when it comes to your account ill take that over fancy features with bugs any day ps the feature to swipe to preview your balance is excellent well done,1chase is my number one go to credit card i have been a chase credit card holder for several years and have had zero problems with them i actually have  chase cards when i have a question i call chase and it is resolved or answered immediately i used to change credit cards every year but those days are gone chase is my one and only card thanks chase for taking care of your customers,1the alerts are useless amp annoying i always get them for a credit card that has not been used for just short of  years get rid of them weve been chase customers for over  years i rely on this app because the customer service inside the banks is spotty and mostly very poorand that is in multiple states amp cities we went with chase because of the extensive atm network when we travel i do like the deposit by this app saves me much time,0recently when using touch id to sign in i receive message to turn on touch id in settings when it was already turned on when i then enter my password i receive message on first attempt too many log in attemptsreset password ive been going through this ritual for the past couple of months im running out of new passwords this is extremely annoying im on the verge of moving my money out of chase i finally called support amp was told to delete app amp reinstall ive done that and will see if this fixes problem if not im done with chase amp chase is done with my moneystay tuned,1im a high school student and its so helpful on letting me manage my money safely as well as receiving money from people i do work for as well as being connected to my moms account so if im ever in trouble i can have her transfer money and i can pay her back through the app also helps when i get checks from the more old fashioned people just one pic and the money appears thanks chase for making my first banking experience a blast,0looping back and still not much has changed here almost a year lateri use chase for my business account the chase mobile check deposit experience has remained unchanged for the last + years you really feel the lack of attention chase gives to its mobile app the moment you try to deposit a checkall i have to compare it to is mobile check deposit with the citi bank app which is so so so good comparatively something to keep in mind if this is an important feature for youaugust it works about  of the time it seems to randomly say that the photo is not clear enough   regardless of how sharp a photo might also it doesnt say if its the front photo or back photo that is causing the problemaside from that the mobile deposit limit can be a pain there is a daily limit and another rolling  day limit  both of which they are not able to change,1i loved my app since the very first iteration was released the whole time i have known about chases ability to do mobile banking i was hooked and never looked back transfers deposits payments and balance inquirys are a breeze i used to dread going to the bank and standing in line for ages nope not with chase mobil banking i havent stood up in line for over  years now and its wonderful thank you chase mobile app changed my life with banking smart,1its a good app overall had some nice security features to it but i would really like to see some more customer friendly interfaces similar to all the functionality found on the main website changing addresses for accounts and the like in the app would be helpful and much more convenient if one does not have immediate access to a computer or to access the website on a phone or having to call to make changes on the phone itself,1this app is amazing  the designers have made it so easy to use that even an inexperienced person will be able to complete all  their banking online  excellent appchase bank is wonderful both online and off this mobile app has made my life so much easier i am a retired disabled senior and to have the ability to deposit checks without leaving the house is amazing  if you dont have this app yet you need to get it,1indeed with my sometimes less than stellar money flows i have had occasion to transfer money while checking out and gotten in done quickly otherwise an overall very navigable site it has number pad when that is all that is required some apps make you toggle to numbers from letters when the field requires numbers only kind of irritating not so the chase bank app,1i opened a credit card account to use as a balance transfer account while on the app i noticed they also offered loans to refinance vehicles so   minutes later i had applied and was approved now saving a total of  a month between  interest on the card and a lower loan rate another thing i like is the app combines both accounts within the app for me to review make payments and receive alerts hopefully they will add more features that they offer on the website,1i love my chase app its super convenient and ive been using it for years it would be nice if it allowed for multiple accounts since i take care of my parents account as well its easy to use and i appreciate the extra security when performing transactions one other recommendation is if the quick pay notification alert was available for both email and text no matter how the transaction is requested,1this app is great works well good layout i am not much of an app person i dont see the need to use space on my phone for apps i use rarely i primarily downloaded this app for the check deposit by phone feature which works great it is really reliable and convenient i do prefer the desktop for more frequent access and use of my account this app is really quick though if i need basic account info quickly,1i havent had any problems with this app have both a personal amp a business acct i like that i can get an instant amp up to the minute view of what is in either one the pending  shows me what has hit the bank but hasnt cleared yet  usually due to a weekend or after business hours if i make a mistake with the debit card i have a few hours to get money in the acct before they overdraw this does not work with checks however,1i use this app almost exclusively for depositing checks unfortunately it is sometimes hit or miss even though i take the picture in good light i have the newest iphone with great camera i often get a message that i have to deposit this check at an atm also i dont quite understand why they have a relatively low limits for check deposits it is also lame that theyre trying to shift responsibility for accurately decoding account number and routing number to the user but that should be the job of the app,1love this chase app because it enable me to look into my account at any time it also makes it so convenient for me to make a chase quick pay to friends and family who has chase accounts it is immediate other accounts might take a day or two but it beats writing and sending out cheques the reason why i gave it  stars is because i find it a bit difficult when it comes to changing or choosing a new password some kind of glitchoverall great app,1i have  business and  personal checking accounts  credit card accounts and an invest portfolio with chase  and a child in college so emergency transfers are part of life this app does everything i need to keep an eye on things pay bills and swap  around i find it easy and quick to use on iphone  for more detailed work i still login on web version but this app keeps me out of a bind when im away from a computer,1the application is easy to use for viewing balances on and offline viewing rewards redemption of rewards and paying bills and credit accounts the only con i see is that in order to pay credit cards you have to enroll via another website which can be hard from a mobile platform use a desktop computer to enroll in credit card payments easy to use otherwise and without issue or app crashes,1as a developer i see the work that an app like this takes every day  what i see must be the result of many dedicated talented people  the app is constantly evolving to fulfill the needs of the user  no app  software is or ever will be perfect  it is the striving to meet those needs that shows a great and outstanding team behind the app  as a user i want to thank each and every person involved in a great product  thank you ,1as a banker who has worked for a few large banks this app is the reason why ive continued to trust chase over the other guys knowing that chase was first on the scene for most of the mobile technology banks use today clearly explain why every feature works seamlessly with each other there is no need to use any other banking app everything else is frustrating after using the chase mobile app,1this app has worked well for me  i love that i can look at my balances look at my recent statements pay bills deposit checks and set alerts in the event a certain situation happens to my account  i couldnt live without the thumbprint loginthis being said there is always room for improvement  id like to see some form of twofactor authentication incorporated instead of just a thumbprint yes it may be more inconvenient but at least it gives more peace of mind,0and more feeschase has lost its focus on what made them the bank they have becomecustomers and now they are prostituting those customers who made their success in the name of fees everything has a fee attached to it and they have my money in their bank it was once a privilege for a bank to have gained trust of customers in order for them to get new customer money thus giving the bank a better rate with feds because they possessed greater assets  now that they have amassed this great asset base from customers we the customers are nothing more than a number that the bank assigns fees and fees and more fees with the customer having little to no say in what happens because of big corporate policy with no exceptionsand my money is more at risk than it has ever been because of all these dark web hackers the hackers are only interested in big fish banks with lots of customers because once they hack the big banks the reward is huge with access to a huge data base of customers and their private informationbye bye big banks bye,1the chase mobile banking app is very helpful tool when having to check the day to day balance i am able to see a rolling balance even if the transaction hasnt cleared im able to transfer money using the quick pay app i do not like how the financial institution places holds on transactions also i think there should be a button to disputed the transaction if you choose not to call in and talk to reps who barely speak english,0i hate this new app  i cant find half the things i find myself needingi ask everyone from branch level up to undo some changes this new app screwed up  it involves paying the mortgage on the house  my husband is listed as primary on the mortgage  since this change was made its been a monthly nightmare i am retired we called and even went to the branch asking they put our mortgage account back to the way it was  i could look at the mortgage account and even make payments online  now i have no access to the accountyou took a good app and totally screwed it up  thanks for nothing from a former chase retirement solutions employee,1i like it so much cute but im not even gonna work at least its okay im just laying here dying of a black eye on the ice ice scream at my work day off at the bars right by my parents house before they go home from school to get a car so im gonna be home alone at home and i have a little bit too late for the gym tomorrow either i just got a cold or a nap right hahahaha right there with my glasses and my wallet and i have to a drink at home and i guess im gonna go home from work,1ok this is a wonderful tool on the iphone we are doing banking on the go now it would be just even better if it would have push for when we use debit cards and credit cards that way we see who is using your linked cards to your account like wife or your kids or when you really do a transsaction that way you know on what are you using your cards great job chase but we need push i would love to see it on next update,1chase is definitely the leader when it comes to online banking especially when it comes to the iphone i had a few accounts at wachovia but thanks to this amazing app i closed all my accounts and moved to chase picture deposits work perfectly and its the most convenient thing thats ever been made for the iphone i hate driving to the bank  minutes away to deposit a check someone gives me and chase now allows me to do so right from my living roomas mentioned before my only suggestion would be to include pending purchases i know its not included in the website either but amex just launched their pending purchases feature on their site and i cant live without it nonetheless get the app its so good that it influenced me to move all my accounts to chase,1 stars for now  the way alerts and alerts history are handled is sillynotification comes in open and an logon press more press alerts press alerts and then your notification disappearswhen you have more than  account it only shows the alerts history for the st account and its not even alphabetical its whatever it wants to be  i have a savings checking and credit card  savings is the first one to pop up  notifications are a huge function you tout in commercials but the implementation is flawed  please fix,0i updated the app this afternoon as prompted and then proceeded  to do some online banking specifically depositing a check i am able to put in the amount and take a picture of the front of the check but each and every time i start to take a picture of the back of the check the app automatically kicks me out amp back to the home screen  ive tried innumerable times to reopen the app log in and deposit again and the same thing happens each time im an idiot i should have made the deposit prior to updating the app but who knew it would render me incapable of doing just that please pretty please solve this problem i do all of my banking via my iphone,0please chase and jp morgan update this application as soon as possible i dont know whats happening but my account balance fluctuates and takes two to three days sometimes  to update my balance which confuses me into how much i can spend and yet i overdraft this is ridiculous chase bank i try and get ahold of corporate  but the line does not go through i am disconnected so by all means this is the only way i can reach out to your company i go into my local branch here in california and im not well aware of chase mobile good job on educating your fellow employees of chase bank if nothing is fixed in the following year youre going to lose my personal banking and my commercial business thank you  chris,1the chase app is truly so convenient the new layout is much more appealing and i have never had an issue accessing my balances and accounts it is super easy to switch back and fourth deposit checks and make transfers right through my phone anytime availability will be limited they notify you in advance so you have ample time to prepare and its almost always on sundays so atms are where i go if need be to take care of transactions really thankful i have this app,1this is a great application for mobile banking there are many fantastic features off the application but im going to focus on the negative the downfalls to the application would be lack of touch id support for logging into the application and screen optimization for the iphone  and iphone  plus it looks like a scaled up mobile app on an ipad screen we have this wonderful new technology so im puzzled as to why chase hasnt jumped the gun on a entirely new application with support for functions you would expect from a modern banking system with wonderful technology at hand,1this app continually shows  notifications in its badge icon i deleted it and reinstalled it  even before i signed into my account with my user name and password it is showing  notifications somethings broken why are there notifications without even an account signed in fix that to get a more objective reviewaside from that the app is straightforward and easy to use but offers nothing earthshattering the account preview option is great through not having to log in just to check balances is definitely a plus,1great app as an employee it makes it super easy to show to customers because of the convenience it provides youre able to check your balances with just a swipe of your finger without having to log in you are also able to make check deposits directly from your phone camera also account statements are easily accessed through this app i highly recommend it for all chase customers,1ive been loving this app since ive been with chase and every time they have an update they always amaze me with new features i was a little bummed you couldnt have your finger touch id when you log in but on the latest update they do have it i also love the dragging to the left of the home screen feature so you can quickly see all your accounts without having to log in keep up the good work,1i use this app every single day being able to have access to my bank account anywhere i go at any time is a total life changer for example if i am running low on money at the end of the month and need a little more in my account to pay for groceries i can transfer from my savings on the spot i also love being able to deposit checks without going to a branch this app is easy convenient and reliable yay,1easy to set up easy to use  chases app sets the standard that all should follow it puts information like balances due and payment sources where you need them when you need them so you dont have to remember whats on one screen to enter info on another screen you also always know where you are in the app and how to navigate to where you need to go other banks could learn from chase as to how to write an app,1over the last couple years i have used a few different banking apps from other commercial banks however the chase app is by far the best convenient quick access to your balance and intuitive interface i especially like the ability to see a preview of my account balances without having to enter my password though the new touchid access makes it a breeze to login anyway well done chase,1great app i use it every single day amp multiple times per day touch id is awesome im glad chase added this feature to the app i would rate this app  stars if i didnt have to manually type my password once i have already authenticated with touch of within the app if its a security concern why not give the customer the option to optin for touch id for bill pay and other transactions which require a password once in the app this is my only requestconcern make this happen and ill be happy,1this app is very convenient however recently theyve added a pop up reminder that you can now go paperless that pops up every time you click on the side menu which drives me nuts and on top of everything its touch id is spotty and usually forgets that youve signed up after two or three times of unlocking it that way which also gets annoying overall the app is convenient and usually works very well just really disappointed with the upgrade,1since the main purpose of my phone is managing work and life rather than entertainment this particular app is one of my most valued on my iphone i am regularly logging in to check charges manage expenses and makes bill paying a breeze  i especially love the fact that i can log in with the thumb scan option instead of typing in a password  love it and use it all the time  thank you chase,1this is a great app but like any other app they all have its flaws man madenever perfect my only wish is that they allow the finger touch work for transfers and any other feature within the app after using the touch for sooooo long i forget my password so when it asks for password to transfer money i ended up going in the branch because i cant remember it but i love this app just work on finger touch for all use of the app one touch should do it,1this app has worked great for me i like to online pay my card and check reward dollars etc and it lets me do all of that quickly and easily ive used it since it came out with only two random days that it gave me error codes like maybe maintenance was being done on the page or something but ive gotten that on the computer before while using the regular page so im not complaining its a convenient app,1i only have a couple of minor issues with this app the first is that i would like for touch id to be a feature that works  of the time i understand for security purposes why they may turn it off on occasion but ill take the risk of having touch id always on the second issue i have with this app is that when i log is that notifications tend to be there even after i have signed in im not sure if that is something all people have or if that only happens to me,1this app allows me to do all the banking i need to when ever wherever the updated interface is also pleasing to the eye ive been using this apps for a long time and it definitely is a time saver being a mom of two small children this app allows me to do most of my banking transactions just about anywhere i also like the graphic of local attractions on the login page when i travel to different places,1i really love this app it lets me know right away if i have a withdrawal a deposit etc its handy so instead of calling the bank and giving my card number every time like the old days i know exactly when a transactions goes through on my phone or anything else that i have done on my account or anyone else for that matter chase overall the app and the actual bank are very secure and i feel safe and secure with them,1i manage properties for owners i require all my tenants to set up quick pay for rental pymts a problem arises when i cant change the default on the mobile app when i receive money it doesnt show you which acct the funds are being depd into either until after ive accepted funds that were depd into the incorrect landlord due to not being on my desktop computer only avenue to change default account pls upgrade this on mobile application otherwise its perfect,1i was rather skeptical at first about using this app but after watching a friend of mine do all of his banking on his iphone i decided to give it a try the part i really love about this app is the ability to take photographs of checks and deposit them directly into my account with this app no longer do i have to travel to the bank i can do it directly on smartphone this will change the way i do banking in the future,1by far chases on line banking app is the best  it is very versatile user friendly and best of all allows me to access all of my personal and business accounts in one unified signon what i am not happy about are the ridiculous interest rates on credit cards and the recent announcement that chase is ending their check overdraft protection that links into their credit cards  being a select or preferred customer means diddly squat,1there will always be some minor things that customers will complain but you have to understand the limitations of mobile applicationbanking it fits the majority of users of having direct access and overview of their account and notifications for deposits and withdrawals  everything else can be done with a simple call if the app is not giving the user what heshe is asking of it,1i like it enough it doesnt replace being on the full web version of course but i am able to check balances pay for credit cards and transfer between accounts with no problem when i am on the go and you can deposit checks with a picture shot only wish i could deposit more than  in a day that may change but i am not sure would save more bank trips,1dont mind the app  its functional and does what i need  i would like the ability to accept quick pays to different accounts on my phone  its seems i have to log into a pc to do it  the alert system isnt convenient enough for me  i have multiple chase accounts and have alerts set up  it can tell me i have  alerts but i have to scroll through every account to see them  it would be better if it actually showed which accounts there were alerts on so i could go directly to it to review it,1i love this app it makes my life from so much easier i can do everything in bed from my phone the only issue i have is that it chooses my daughters savings account instead of our main account to send or transfer money and i always have to remember to change it i dont know why it is the default account i cant change it on the app i have to go to the bank to change it other than that i love it,1i do like the app once i get into it i have an iphone  and every time i want to get into the app it says it doesnt recognize my device and it texts me an eight digit passcode then you put your password word in even if i turn the touch id login option once im in the app the next day it says it doesnt recognize my device then i have to repeat everything over again if im driving thats next to impossible and super irritating i really do like the app but i dont like to use it because its like trying to get into fort knox please fix this for god sake,1the app is fine to do a quick sporadic deposit  but i hate the fact that the information on pending expenditures is never up to date  it will show these for numerous days as pending so ive given up using it and go online instead  then of course they changed the website to look more like the app and thats awful but at least the information is up to date cant tell you how many times ive paid a bill twicegod knows that it doesnt let you that youve already scheduled a pymt for the same day,1if you are constantly checking your money and balancing your budget like me then chase application is for you not only you can activate your notifications so youre reminded of your expenses but also you can deposit checks pay bills and do quick pay with anyone that also have a chase account also i have never had technical issues with the app i strongly recommend this app,1this app continually impresses me it does everything i need it to do and it does it well support at the brick amp mortar locations is also wonderful they have an understanding of the app and can always answer questions i switched to chase a few years ago because they were the only ones with an app and im glad that i did it has proven to be very useful and getting better all the time thanks for the great app,1the chase app is great however i do have another bank app as well and they offer more it would be nice if chase calculated and showed your balance with every transaction also other banks offer cash back deals on certain purchases ex  back on a purchase from aldo or  back off your full bill at red lobster this cash back is deposited into your account at the end of the month at most it will total the  service fee you take from me,1i dont have a chase bank close to where i live inconvenient but they make up for it with this app i can make deposits not cash of course and see everything that i need to see with it im happy with itupdatei am still rating this app a  i have had zero problems with it no deposit issues other than one check took several days to post one time no update issues no issues whatsoever thanks chase,1this app makes banking and keeping up with your finances easier than you would believe pay bills transfer money deposit checks and anything else you could need right in your pocket no more going to branch or sitting in front of a computer to handle banking needs beautiful i love the convenience technology and chase give me this was auto populated by apple or chase none the less true though,1i love my chase app but i think there are a few things that could be changed and improved like when i open my app sometimes the touch id doesnt work and i have to manually input my password also i wish that the chase app had a widget for the notification screen so that i dont have to login to my account every time i want to see how much money i have all in all the app is great i just think these two this would make it even better,0the new check depositing picture recognition is annoyingly overlaid and complains that the picture isnt clear enough sometimes even in perfect lighting with a steady hand and perfect resolution when asked if this picture should be used if thats not really the issue then it should say so otherwise its just wrong and wont let me deposit the check so now i have to go to the bank in person but as it told me i must do i have now written on the back that this check is for electronic deposit only so well see if i even can do it in person good luck,1overall this is a good app i havent had the problems other users indicate in their reviews it works as advertised for me and helps me pay bills keep track of my balances and deposit checks one feature i wish it had is the ability to fully manage repeating payments i can set up andor edit single payments but to set up or modify repeating or series payments i have to log on at a computer thats the major drawback of this app in my experience,1the app is disappointingly basic doesnt have the feel of a native ios app most of the links open up in a separate browser whats the point of the app then i might as well open the mobile website if i wanted the same experience whoever is designing or developing the app is either a  year old learning mobile app development on coursera or is someone who has never seen a banking mobile app before for an organization as big as chase bank the app reeks of lack of quality bank of america has done so much better with its app,1this app goes beyond what i was expecting i can do all my regular online banking as conveniently as if i was at home on my desktop computer the alerts and other details are very handy so i know where i stand with my account at all times i use it multiple times a day since i first installed it over a year ago and ive encountered no bugs yet and there are no inapp purchases to buy i love this app its one of the most used app on my iphone,1apps works fine for what i need it for but if there was any one thing i would change is the advertisingget rid of it i hate seeing the current ad in the log in screen for low intro apr offer i dont have want or need any credit cards so stop trying and same goes when i log into the app done need or want any coupons or what have you your all ready making money off the money i have in the bank why do i have to put up with this crap ontop of things,1the only thing that didnt work is the touch id login other than that never had a problem with this app in years someone said they cant pay bills i still have that option another said their activity doesnt show quickly enough if paychecks are direct deposited transactions update within minutes amp while some may have a pending status the available balance shown includes those transactions i love the check deposit function,1the way this app has kept me on track knowing where ive spent and how much is awesome no one else has any thing like it i dont know how many people ive told why would i want to go to any other bank keep up the good work my friends and family are even telling other non chase bank people how good chase is how chase goes the extra mile ive never had a bank that treated me with such dignity and respect keep up the good work,0my only gripe about this app although its a big one is that it never remembers that i turned on the touch id and always locks me out due to too many unsuccessful attempts even though there have been zero i always have to go through the process of giving my social and card number and resetting my password then i go in and turn on touch id again but no matter it wont remember and the very next time i try to sign in it locks me out agin ive called tech support  times and they always say i should be good going forward nope once logged in the app is sleek and works great but sheeesh what a hassle,0the reason they only have one screenshot is because that is the only part that is the app once you log in it takes you to the same badly designed mobile site terrible no balance at the end of each transaction very small words with underlines as links only shows last  transactions then requires you to hunt down a tiny link to load more transactions that could have fit in one line take up  lines i could go on and on dont bother even downloading it you get the same experience if you went straight to the site on the browser hey chase one screen does not an app make,0my available balance just jumped from  to  in the last  minutes for no reason  this occurs regularly  usually from am to am  i assume this extremely wrong information happens because of staggered delays in chase overnight processing  but for a business account to be thousands of dollars off  this is unacceptable  i could have paid some bills with money that wasnt even there and gone overdrawn  still very annoyed you dont have a proper contact form for this app sending us to an  number where people dont have a clue what to do and no training on how to get bug information to the programmers is very poor procedure for such a large company,1just updated to the new app today im totally amazed with the way i looks and the easy navigation too many people are complaining about the new update and forget that an app is something to use while on the go apps dont replace an actual full website view and should be something easy and convenient to use it still has the same great features as before but now looks way better than you so much for this,1seems like this app was stuck in the th century in terms of design and functionality but the late bloomers at chase finally gave their mobile app the much needed facelift it deserved i like the layout in fact i wouldve liked any new layout over the old one i have used all the features to give it a  star rating so ill hold judgement other than that im actually pleased my chase app is redesigned and has added the basic features i feel all bank apps should have nowadays,1i find it very frustrating that i cant look up checks on the phone app like on my desktop furthermore its very user unfriendly especially for people like me who didnt grow up in the digitalcomputer era i liked the phone app a lot better before they went and tried to make it easier  instead its more confusing im forever having to use my desktop for things i should be able to do with phone app  like accept money etc i did have faith in chase and thats why i switched banks but now im having second thoughts signed dazed amp confused,1i love this app i use it daily it has eliminated the burden of having to travel to a bank to deposit a check under  and made chase quickpay to friends and family so simple and quick i manage all of my checking savings and credit accounts pay bills and checkcash my ultimate rewards all on my iphone if you are a chase customer this app is a nobrainer musthave it deserves the  star rating that it has,1what a wonderful tool instant access to your accounts atm locations and much more i am a busy mom and always on the go i usually have to wait until i get home or until i get to the nearest computer to submit payments pay the bills online this is no longer the case im able to submit payments transfer funds check balances etc at the palm of my hand i rate this a + and recommend it to anyone absolutely love it,1this app has been great from the start  the recent updates make it fresh looking and more inviting while still being easy to use  it falls short of  stars because the notification center needs to be simplified  if i get a notification the app doesnt tell me for which account and that leads me to search all accounts and look for the date which is the only way i know of to tell of new notifications  fix that and this easily becomes a  star app,1i can definitely appreciate that chase is gone the extra mile when they designed this app i have a bank of america credit card and their app is pretty crappy i like the design of the app but more importantly the functionality is whats really important they have by far the most alerts you can get on your bank information so you always know where youre at in the game and you always feel like youre protected,1banker told me that they will be adding view statements soon which i think is awesome for an app check deposits works perfectly i have +  i noticed that the majority of the problems are with older phone so i think it has to do with the ios update not being supportedcompatible    unrelated the tetris app doesnt work for me but it works on my old phone in this case i think it is the app that hasnt been updated to work with new ios,1im not in general fond of banking apps but this is an exception with the addition of touch fingerprint id log on this experience is smooth from start to finish i have multiple accounts for my kids in college and shifting funds and making online deposits is a breeze the check deposit  function works with the iphone camera no real gripes other than it can take a while for the transfer to occur between banks on weekends especially,0the alerts from this app are completely unreliable especially on weekends as though the system takes a holiday while you spend money expecting an alert when your balance is low you probably will get your overdraft notice on monday if you rely on the alerts from this app also i needed a second checking account to deposit my checks from the app bc my main account only sometimes with no apparent rhyme or reason doesnt accept digital deposits that day this app is not a good source of information to protect you by way of the alerts system beware,1a couple of years ago i couldnt get into my account with my card without having to use my pin number i called chase and they had closed my account except for using my pin due to the fact that someone had gotten a hold of my account number and was trying to charge over  at the store that i would never go to i am grateful to chase for doing that and i recommend chase to anyone who doesnt have chase,1i use this app daily and it doesnt disappoint  when i submit a shortcoming to chase it magical appears in the next update   with the recent addition of touch id and external transfers there is little you cant do while mobilethe ui is very nice and the only thing that bugs me about it is that it uses delivered dates on the pending list as opposed to transaction dates  that makes it very hard to judge a future balance when funds run low,1best business app ive ever used i set all my reoccurring payments here which makes keeping track of whats going out when easy to view in one location at any time many companies dont understand that life has become too fast so we need simple and clean websites and apps to manage our lives quickly and accurately  this app is definitely a big reason i bank with chase still stellar development team chase,1generally a great app just wish i could change the default account for quickpay through the app instead of having to go to the website since sometimes i receive money for my business and sometimes its personal so i need to accept money into two different accounts also it would be great to be able to review checks that are waiting for me in fraud protection through the app,1sadi can deposit both my business checks and personal checks from the app  i can only do it for one or the other account  but not both  it would be an improvement to the app if you make that changealso  alerts come on tons of times  but doesnt clear after ive seen them  then the little red alert circle is always on and i end up ignoring my alerts  so whats the point of having alerts if i just go and ignore themplease fix this glitch,1this app is put together well its easy to use and i feel secure when i use the chase app and card i would say this app isnt a  star but more like a  it didnt deserve a  star though i would rate a  because a few minor improvements would be nice such as instant alerts my discover card app alerts me within seconds of using my card the chase app seems to lag a little in that department but overall im very happy with it,1i think the best compliment i can pay this app is that i dont think about it after years of use now i cant recall even once having a problem with it balance inquiry check deposits branch amp atm locations quickpay so i can literally message money to people online bill paythe only time i need to go to the bank is if i need to deposit cash otherwise i can do everything else from my phone outstanding,1always works never have had problems with any of my many devices  never have issues with updates either  good security features usability i like that i can use touch log in to view  chase keep up the good work  dont let good reviews go to your head and start cutting back  i expect this kind of quality especially when it comes to my money  it would be nice to see the same elsewhere,1i dont know about youbut i love the new atms its so convenient being able to withdrawal the exact amount that i need i also benefit from the liquid card they upgraded it to where i can budget and pay bills i also appreciate the security chase provides i will continue to be a customer for life every teller has been pleasant and professional i ask for this bank to continue the marketing and business they provide upgrade ya,1i love the new look and how easy it is to move around my son uses his all the time and he hates changes also i love how the scene changes depending on your location or time of day this app is a lifesaver if it wasnt for the app i would be in a lot of trouble since there is not a branch in the state i live in and the closest one is one state over an hour and a half drive away so the ease of depositing a check on the app is great otherwise i will be filing another bag,0all my other banking apps work better then this one the app wouldnt let me log in when i need to pay my bill and i was late because of it by  minutes i found out that you can call some one until  pm est to pay your bill but have to pay it online by pm est and worst they didnt tell me that until i was charged a late fee the costumer service is also bad and the combo makes for a frustrating situation think twice before joining chase when there technology fails it is your fault and they will treat you like a number more so the any other bank i have been with my card is cut into pieces and i am looking for another bank to join,1i like it especially that it uses thumbprint security when checking alerts its not real clear where the alert came from which account which card when signing in it would be nice that the initial screen show an interesting picture view of something thats in the area of where you are based on location services for me this confirms that the app knows where you are comfortable knowing it doesnt think im somewhere else security feature,1this app is so easy to use and shows me everything i need to know about all my accounts with chase i love the new functionality to be able to see checks within the app i can also transfer money backandforth between accounts and search through all my activity history and using the fingerprint sensor to login instead of typing my password saves a ton of time i love it,0awkward navigation very difficult or impossible to find next automatic payment date does not show transaction history including credits and payments  they are in separate areas silly relogin after already logged in with fingerprint recognition so many other banks and credit unions do a much better job of providing app functionality for their accounts i only have a chase credit card which makes some of the button presses useless andor redundant many months i have to call to be sure that my payment will process on time because the app doesnt provide that information and leaves me more confused,1i have been using this for a year and found that it was fast and very easy to get account information as well as do things like set up bill payments transfer money and check the amount if funds available this was set up primarily to help my elderly mother with her account and found that is is very easy to do just that with this app would recommend this to anyone with chase accounts,1have been customer of chase when it was wa mutual  for a mega bank chase does an excellent job with customer service as well as having an ap that works very well even on an iphone  use the mobile function for depositing checks checking balances and transferring funds mostly but it always works well  having been around before computers and smart phones i appreciate good usable aps and this is one of those  thanks chasesallie r,1over all this app is absolutely fantastic i use it every day to check my balance deposit checks sendrecieve money etc the user interface is intuitive for me and clean the alertnotification system is a little screwey in that its a bit of a pain to open the app enter my password or use the fingerprint and tap through three or four menu options just to look at the alert to clear the notification but im not entirely sure thats fixable given security concerns overall thanks for an excellent app guys,0i loved this app when it first came out it was so easy and functioned well one of the main features that i loved was the deposit check from your phone  unfortunately this feature has been temporarily unavailable for monthsdisappointing as it is not always convenient for me to go to the branchhow long have i had this app and the deposit checks still does not workits been some time years since writing the above review i have deleted and reloaded the app as well as have a new phone and still the check deposit does not work temporally unavailable suggests it will be available yet it never is disappointed and frustrated that chase has not fixed thisfurther more they make it a tedious task to report the problem  it would be lovely to have a contact app support link that is on the app leading one to an email page or something of the link  a phone number and the statement to log into my computer to send a message is what is offered,1have used this app for years and it is very easy to maneuver except for the alerts problem could be me but how do you get rid of the alerts once you have read them if i can figure that out then this app is perfect depositing checks is easy and with the changes they have made you can see all your balances in one glance one other drawback i wish i could make a list of payments at one time rather than individual ones still deserves  stars,1i love this mobile app for chase bank  it makes my banking so much easier and i can look at my statements and my accounts anytime i want i love the new touch id so i dont have to type in a password every time i love that i can deposit checks just by taking a photo on my iphone this app  will do just about anything i  used to have to stand in line to do at the bank  i highly recommend this one its one of my favorite apps ,1overall i enjoy the chase app because i can easily monitor funds in my debit and credit cards easily pay my credit card quickly review transactions made in any of my cards downside is that every now and then the app is down and it doesnt let me slide to quickly check funds in my cards nor does it let me login other than that i love this app and banking with chase also it provides the choice to find the nearest atm or branch how convenient right,1most needs can be handled on this app love the convenience easy access to information yet very secure it keeps me uptodate with my information and can add alerts to help manage things i  deposited checks w no issues it does state however it takes a couple days to confirm deposit at which time one receives a confirmation that deposit went thru via email if you need immediate deposit suggest going to bank,1just recently switched from wells fargo to chase my boyfriend told me they treat their customers really well i dont have any hidden fees or anything i really like their different card selection is aslo like props that they give you from disney and also their disney cards are super cute their service fees arent as high as other banks and if you have any overdrafts fees they  will work with you to take care of it which i think is pretty awesome yes chase is great,1i like the chase app for its many mobile banking features and mostly simple and intuitive user interface unfortunately it remains difficult to tell which alert notification is the most recent and triggering a new badge alert secure messages still dont work well in the mobile app chase has come along way with making the mobile and web experiences similar but these are the big remaining disconnects,1this app allows you to see your chase accounts quickly and easy youre phone lets you pay off your credit card or take pictures of checks to deposit you can transfer money even between accounts which can be awesome if you need it basically anything you can do on the computer is possible on this app and it doesnt seem risky with the security setup,1i am a costumer since the change from washington mutual to chase and i use this application everyday its so important now you can pay anyone in a few clicks deposit checks in a few pics and move you money from accounts it will let you know everything that happened in your account by texts emails and even phone calls thank you chase for a smart cool and easy application,1the chase bank credit card app is a comprehensive tool for the management of your credit line with jp morganchaseif you have been granted a substantial amount of credit with chase it is imperative that you use the many features of this app to keep your borrowing within reasonable limitsas long as you keep your balance what you have borrowed from the bank to less than about  of your credit line and you pay at least the minimum required each month then chase will be satisfied with your use of their money and your credit score will improvei recommend that you always pay at least twice the minimum required every month that way you will gradually pay down your balance and never get into trouble,1ive been with chase for over  years now since i started college im a huge fan of this app and its only getting better with time its so easy to transfer money between accounts and pay bills  would highly recommend sometimes it takes a hot minute for the fingerprint sign in to show up but i dont have any major complaints about the app or how it works,1i love the chase app its great for checking balances bill pay and transfers etchowever it has some quirks that need to be fixed as an example when you try to enter your mobile number for quick pay under settings after checking ive read the disclosures you cant click next because its grayed out i tried on  different devices so its a problem in the app very frustrating so ill have to do it from the website,1app is good so far only complaint i have is that when i try to make check deposits from home the transaction is never accepted and i try multiple times per day and the following day and same issue my photo copies are legible front and back but still get those annoying frustrating popup that isnt acceptable or visit your nearest branch to make a deposit i know that i can visit my nearest branch but im trying to avoid from having to make that trip chasepls look into this feature and see if it can be resolved,1i downloaded it wo reading the reviews and thought it was a pretty good app i think people r being a bit harsh on chase really convenient a lot better than text mobile but dont expect it to be as friendly as the actual chase website ez to nav wish could go further back on transaction history overall perfect to check bal xfer money pay bills what else would u want it for by the way kuddos to chase for staying strong even in a tough economy,0update ive deleted the app its fastereasier to load safari to access my account this app is ridiculousby far the most annoying app youll want to keep keep because you have an account at chase annoying because it constantly needs to go through a registration process because as it says upon load we dont recognize this device guess what folks if i can sign into my accounts from any browser on any machine anywhere in the world with my loginpassword so should i be able to from my phone a registration process should not be necessary let alone every  or  times you load the app and if it is necessary then i shouldnt need my loginpassword,0i have tried over and over again to deposit checks with my g iphone and it does not work it says that the amount i entered does not match the amount on the check i have tried this with several different checks and its always the same result on top of that it only allows you a couple of minutes before automatically logging you off this is the dumbest feature of all i can understand the idea to protect you in case you forget to logout however it should be smart enough to know if you are still actively using the app or at the least it should ask you if you need more time,1i use this app every day  i cant even tell you the last time i walked into an actual bank or used the driveup to take care of my my banking  i can take care of everything i need with all three of my acounts with this one app  i pay bills and tranfer funds between my accounts   of my deposits are directdeposit but i used the photocheck deposit feature without a hitch  its just a cool and simple app,1the interface for viewing all my accounts is good and convenient  unlike other users who have complained about the quick deposit not working it working fine on the first attempt for me  i could be that the chase service requires the higher resolution camera on the iphone   i took the photos of the cheque late at night in a not very well illuminated room and still it worked fine,0check your balance no prob  try to deposit a check and the goats go rodeo  iphone  no go iphone gs no go  if it doesnt like your pix it just ejects you from the app and it rarely likes an image  went to the nearest chase branch on the corner today and they could not give me  in hundreds or fifties  simply didnt have them and said the next nearest branch could not cash the check either  and this isnt unusual four times with this nonsense in as many months  when folks started getting their tax refunds cashed they couldnt even cash a check for   next they will want us to accept the new chase currency it will be called the chase magic bean initiative lol,1i think the chase mobile app is great you can check balances view transactions make mobile deposits do account transfers pay bills etc its almost everything you can do online on a computer the only things you cant do are set up new services like chase quickpay or new bill pay accounts but thats because of security overall i love it because i never have to go to the bank,1been using the app for about  months now whenever i needed to check my balance however last night i got a chance to try the deposit feature where you take a picture of the check it did give me some kind of error message at first but i just hit submit again amp i got to the confirmation screen it just posted to my account before i even woke up this morning it was so convenient,1i hate how people give every official app from every company such negative reviews because they cant login or something it works great for me i have actually stayed away from some apps because of the reviewsill never make that mistake againremember most people will only review a nonindependent app if they have a problem see if it works for you if it does like it does for me great if not then there are always other options,0the ease of depositing a check is super convenient and would save me almost daily trips to the bank waste of gas and time however there is a daily cap of  and a monthly deposit limit of  which is impractical for business useit could have been a  star app but i can only give it  stars one for the ability to check my business and personal accounts make transfers between accounts pay my chase card balance and the ease of doing a deposit holding back the remaining  stars until they lift the daily and monthly deposit limits,0my husband and i despise this new update it is way too huge and white  it was much more readable and convenient to see all your transactions at a glance before this horrible new update  we also agree with another reviewer that there is a lot of lag time getting on and also switching between screensanother big issue is security andor privacy  if i want to check my balance while out in public via store or even a plane anyone can see it at a glance its just way too huge  i shouldnt have to put out the extra money to put a privacy filter on my screen because of this issue of concernhaving said all that of the hugeness of it all the arrows to get to your activity and such is quite the opposite too tiny  it makes it hard to utilize and even figure out which arrow to press for what yet the pay bills button is so huge that i keep hitting it on accidentplease please please reconsider modifying this update to be a bit more like it was it was so much more readable secure and user friendly,1i love using this app it helps me access my accounts quickly and pay people instantly aside from a few days when they were working on the site it has always been very reliable and easy to understand what is going on with my balance when someone stole my card information we were able to track it immediately and take care of the problem,0i haves used this app since it came out and it was very helpful on this last update i now do not have the ability to see the actual deposit slips which is one of the ways i manage my deposits while on the go instead if improving the app they have stripped out essential functions this does not make sense until they fix this i am back to calling the local branch to verify which deposits came in and which baking partner made them this blows my branch mentioned that they were starting to limit access to some of the info online arghhhh bring back the old functionality,1my chase banking app is among the most reliable on my iphone its always up im able to pay my statement online quickly and easily and it doesnt crash its very easy to navigate around the design is cleaning the text is easy to read i have a discovered a way to change my text alerts within the app yet but those have been very helpful in watching transactions,1this is my first experience with a chase bank mobile app although i have used chase bank for many years and for several simultaneous accounts it is very convenient and gives me a lot of flexibility in transferring funds sending wires paying bills etc  the check depositing feature is also very handy but i think the check amount limit should be raised to at least  from its present ceiling of   john d from houston tx,1i just downloaded this app on my iphone amp my cements are that it is pretty much similar to the mobile apps of some of the leading banks in the usone of the major miss that i would say is that i couldnt trace the details of the transactions which i have on my card  maybe it is available on the app but the very fact that i couldnt trace it just tells me that it could have been designed well keeping what most customers would use this app for this is the only reason why i would rate it a ,0the primary reason i downloaded the chase mobile app was so i wouldnt have to drive to the nearest chase location to do a hard deposit the app worked flawlessly on my iphone s today i tried to do a quick deposit on my new iphone  and while the account login account selection deposit amount all worked perfectly the image window showed black i pressed the camera icon and my camera flashed on my phone but no image to approve or send eh and your report a problem link takes me to the chase moble app page but no mode to report problems other than what i can only imagine is the seven circles of automated phone system hell,1this will be the first app ive ever done a review around i use it for business and for personal reference wheatear i just need to quick view my balance scan a check with my camera phone or quick pay someone it just simply works and is functional enough to keep me out of the bank also i like the fact that im always at least  blocks from an atm thanks to chase all these other banks can keep their petty atm fees,1ive used this so many times standing in line at starbucks or at the store to transfer money into my card and it works so fast ive used the find a branch feature while at downtown and it was able to open up maps and give me accurate directions as for people complaining about payments ya need to go to a branch and have them take a look at your online account and make sure you have it activated its a great app,1most of the time i love this app and being able to access my bank account at the touch of a finger literally the only problem is im not sure if its just my phone i cant imagine that it is but i get a message more often than i would like telling me the mobile app is currently unavailable and to try again laterthat it is a huge inconvenience i never know whether it is going to cooperate with me or not other than that the app has everything i need,1ive used wells fargos banking app us banks app bank of americas app and they all pale in comparison of what youre able to do on the app vs online or in a branchthe app deposit is smooth and accessing all account information is quick and easy i like the addition of touch id for quick access to balances chase does an amazing job of keeping everything updatedoverall its a great app looking forward to more features being added,1i like the chase app and i like the fact that you guys implemented touch id however what i dont get is that in order to do anything beyond seeing my balances such as pay a credit card transfer money etc i still have to enter my password that kinda defeats the purpose of touch id you even gave us the ability to see our balances without logging in by swiping right on the login screen so your touch id implementation is basically useless please give the option to not have to enter passwords once im authenticated with touch id,1this app makes the business of everyday banking simple and convenient using high school checking my  year old is beginning to understand how banking works this app is extremely useful in teaching good banking practices with plenty of options for alerts quick balance check with just a swipe and so much more chase has greatly improved their app over the years obviously listening to its customers suggestions,1all in all this is an excellent bank app i note that i have some checks that may be dated saying something like good until february  the chase app is unable to process a check like this and the check is rejected the ally app on the other hand will allow you to certify that the date is ok and will continue to process the check i hope that the chase people learn from this and modify their app so that we can deposit checks that are dated in advance like this,1i had all the major banks and still am active with multiple institutions chase app is and has been the best its easy to navigate i can pay in three actions securely the layout is clear and uncluttered my schedule can be long so having things work at odd hours is nice i had a bank app post the sorry cant be done right now try again in a little while chase is on point and knock on wood hope they keep up their a game,1i love using touch id if its an option because its safer than entering a pin chase is the only app where touch is available but i have to reset it every few days it seems its so annoying also in general it always says it doesnt recognize my device i only have one phone and always use it so why isnt it being recognized other than those two issues i think its good i like how the background picture changes to match your location i use this app daily nd just wish they would fix those things,0this app could have a lot more to offer its very difficult to use even for an iphone thumb print only works to log into the app after that youre on your own having to type in a password for everything else also if you were looking to review your rewards forget it youll need a whole different app for that i for one having using other credit card companies know this app could have a lot more to offer and in comparison its a  maybe  star rating the entire experience is just very basic i personally dont like it i hope they improve it as time goes on,1this app is ok  ive seen better and ive seen worse there is nothing especially great about its functionality there are however a couple of things i find annoying about this app thing   one must reenter your password for everything why if ive already entered the password to login and have not been idle i shouldnt have to enter the password to transfer money or use quickpay thing   you cannot initiate emails to customer service from the app while you can respond to emails you must initiate from a desktop for what,1i like almost everything about it my only quibble is re when i write a note in bill pay that is to appear on the check the app doesnt follow the standard iphone user interface of doublespace equaling a period and many other characters are illegal i am constantly fixing the note also some features dont yet exist although they do in the iphone safari web browser or on the mac or pc such as composing a message to customer service,1this app is great does what it needs to which is provide me access to my account balances i also like the option for customizable alerts because of this app i knew the minute someone stole my card number and was able to call chase and have them freeze my account until it was fixed i can also easily transfer money between accounts cant get any better than that,1this apps user interface and style has greatly improved since i first downloaded the chase app on top of that this new revision has big functionality improvements its snappier cleaner and less buggy overall the essence of an update that all being said the app isnt perfect its still has long ways to go before one can call it amazing mobiles current goal is the blur the lines between mobile and desktop this app is doing a good job but hasnt done it quite yet,1im able to see and manage my credit cards my savings and checking accounts all things chase as well i can connect chase to outside external accounts such as us bank accounts and my credit union too  free online deposits of checks is easy and fast as well as transferring money between accounts is easy and fast with this app,1ive been with chase now for about  years and i just love this app ive ive had it for about six years now and pretty much exclusively do my banking through the app its always nice to be able to know exactly the status of my banking and if i need to transfer money from savings to my checking i dont have to go home and jump on my computer or go to the bank i can just do it from the app so it is perfect for my lifestyle,1they keep bothering me to write a review its generally a good app and i pay some bills through it for me the biggest deficiency is that it does not tell me if im paying the payee twice to set up or change a recurring payment i believe it must be done on the website thats a serious limitation i may be incorrect about this but sometimes it does not say that ive scheduled a payment already otherwise its a very useful app and quick to get account information and activity,1the chase mobile app is amazing  i can use it to check balances transfer funds pay bills pay others redeem rewards points set reminders and more  i can even scan and deposit checks through my mobile device  i cannot express how convenient this app is other than to say that for the last two years i have not needed to set foot inside a bank,1ive been using this app for quite a long time now ive never had any problems or technical issues with it as all apps require time to getting use to and learning the different features every feature is simple and user friendly you can access your accounts make payments transfer receive money and view bank statements easily i recommend this app to everyone who has chase,1chase has been very professional and courteous   this web app is great i check it every day and if i forgot what a charge was or question it the site usually includes a phone number for the vendor it will show you the face of a check you wrote if you dont recall the check  website is very clear and easy to use  adding only that scheduled future recurring payments are sometimes hard to find,1i want to first start off by saying i absolutely love chase bank i have been a customer since i was in my early twenties and i dont plan on changing very convenient good customer service and just overall professional the app is great a few hiccups from time to time like when suddenly my touch id suddenly wont work to log me in but i can deal with a few glitches in comparison to over overall great rating of the app,1i love this app it has everything i need to stay on top of my account the one thing that annoys me is getting the same alert over and over without giving any new or specific information when i see the red number on the icon i go to alerts and theres the same message telling me my daily info is available the alert feature should be used for new info or changes in the account not a robot statement of something thats obvious but i still love the app,1i have used chase for at least  years i am impressed with how the app keeps getting more powerful  so far i am very satisfied  the new way to remote deposit checks is a bit more demanding than previously but i still neednt go out in the rain or snow to do it so i dont care  as long as i keep in mind that the app may be down for part of sunday for maintenance i do just fine  i find the branch personnel to be very nice too,1been using this app for years and love it easy to navigate easy to deposit checks with easily able to transfer money between accounts and has the transactions loaded almost as soon as they occur aside from some bills where that company takes time to process payment much easier to use than other banking apps ive used customer service has been great also,1i am very pleased with the chase app i generally just use it to check my account balance see when checks have cleared or to arrange for a quick pay for all these uses the app is accurate and easy to use no problems to datei have now begun using the remote deposit feature and i love it im not the steadiest photographer but even i can take a clear shot of the front and back of checks and then submit it saves time and gas and thats very important great feature,0i dont like how the balance view has been taken away i think when the new statement starts it moves the rest out of the view and you have to click on looking at the statement and you can only see your charges on this tiny little statement on the screen i liked it before how you could easily look at all your charges just by scrolling down the page its a lot more difficult to check the charges and make sure everything is correct or make sure there are no authorized charges i dont know why they had to change it,1i wish the function of being able to see your balance without having to log in was still available however ive never had a problem with the app things are sometimes not available but that only because theyre doing an update but thats not that often i do wish we had full control of the account through the app but i guess thats not available for security reasons overall i have no issues with the app,1i cant say enough how wonderful to be able to see what you spent immediately   when i was credited on to my account which occurred quickly was a joy  to have a personal banker on your hands if you will is amazing    to be able to deposit a check  wow   so automatically  i check it daily and its just outstanding   i love this app  its ok when its down once in a while life happens  its just gets better with time,0ive used the chase app for years and have never had a problem until the most recent update i frequently use the mobile deposit feature however it does not work in the latest version of the app check information can be entered and the images will work but it does not process the checking account numbers correctly and entering the correct account information manually causes the deposit to fail this has happened with  different deposits now hopefully the next update will correct this issue,1please add current and available cash advance balances to the screen that shows you your available credit pending charges payment date etc this would be very helpful for those of us that travel extensively overseas and use our chase ccs to get local currency at atms being able to set travel notifications from the iphone app would also be a great feature maybe this is already there and i havent found it otherwise a good app,1the chase bank app is so well thought out and easy to use that i find there is zero reason to walk into a bank anymore transfer money from one account to another  check deposit a check  easy  pay bills or chase credit card  of course thats the basics need to break  bill into smaller bills  the app hasnt figured that out but i bet they are working on it,1i am getting ready to switch credit cards because this app continually gives me problems logging in whenever i want access to my account i have to use safari because the app will never connect to chase the password im using is correct and i have deleted and redownloaded the app multiple times with the most updated version,1chase bank might be the antchrist but they sure do protect your funds and listen to there clientscustomers someone sent me a fake check i deposited it found out  hours later it was fake called chase and explained two days later the check bounced because it was fake i called and they assured me this is procedure that i had not lost any funds and didnt have to pay because i warned them  hour later the bank statement was up to date,1easy to use all my accounts on the go well organized  the only reason i rated as  stars is that i wish i could arrange what order accounts show on the app  example in alerts the default account that shows up is one i dont have any alerts for  very small thing but would love the functionalityupdate this app has only gotten better over time  kudos to jpmc for thinking of their customers,1i was a little apprehensive about using a banking app on my phone but thought i would give it a try and i absolutely love the easy way to navigate the site i was further convinced that i did the right thing since our internet went out yesterday and they are still trying to resolve the issue but i could just grab my phone and do my bill paying not that anyone looks forward to paying bills,1if you are like me and always running around and dont have time to check your balances and paid bills at home this is the app for you it gives you up to date balances and allows you to transfer money and pay bills it couldnt be any easier this is a must have app for chase customers atm locations are great too no more settling on radom atms and thier expensive fees because you cant find chase,1this app is all u need for convenience nothing fancy however it definitly beats using safari it finds only  atm per searchdisapointed there the nearest atm was at a nearest hospitalamp well i was not gonna go there and it did not display any other locations i found at least  locations near me in google maps im giving it  stars because it is quick and therefore convenient but guys can you please make it find more than  atm per search,1i havent had any major problems with this app before except for maybe one or two glitches sometimes that it freezes or takes too long to load also it would be nice to see the overall balance of my accounts though that should be a new update from chase i trust my money with chase so much ever since i switched from bank of america to chase so i should be able to have the freedom to bank more conveniently when i need to thats all other than that just chase what matters,1i was afraid they had screwed up a great app when i read the reviews but i had already downloaded it so i went ahead and syncd because i actually use this app every few days im using it on a sprint iphone s and its working great right now i went through all of the areas i use ot for  tranfers between accounts history deposit etc and they all work,1this app is great when it works  since the ios  update on my iphone s i can only make random deposits  it works once out of every  tries  the problem is that once you start to take the picture of the front of the check the app totally closes  you then have to go back through the log in process which is such a beating to go through over and over  hopefully this will get fixed soon so that we dont have to revert to the old fashioned way of depositing checksdriving to the bank,1i love the app and how clean + efficient it is when it works  you have to shut your wifi off call me lazy but this step is annoying if it werent for that little problem i would give this app five stars i would even give it four if this problem wasnt in effect for over a month with technology like scan and deposit it would be hard to believe that the tech team couldnt squash such a minor bug get with it chase some ppl rely so heavily on their banking apps it could cause them to switch banks ok im done ranting,1decent app  wish it had a few more features but honestly its great as is for example i wish that the history section was done a bit better but what are you gonna do its a mobile apphaving to update is part of keeping this app secure  i feel that people complaining about the need to update would be the same people complaining if the app was vulnerable and their bank info got stolen its the st century security updates are a necessity live with it or live with hackers exploiting app vulnerabilities,0even with the update the transfer money option is not therei have called and complained for over a week now about not being able to transfer money online or on this mobile app the overseas rep told me it was my issue and hung up on me yesterday all my account said  balance and i held on for over  minutes to speak to someone only to be told they could not help me and to call back today today i am having the same issue and it seem they could care less i am very upset they need to fix this issue as this is a huge inconvenience to me in looking at the reviews im not the only one who has this issue the transfer money option is just not even there anymore,1i love banking with chase and i also love lots of the convenient things i can do with my iphone app my only complaints are that its difficult to use the check deposit feature keeps sending error messages and you have to retry it four or five times before it works and that you cant see images of checks that have cleared the way you can on the website if those two things could be fixed this would be a five star app all the way,1i enjoy using this app it is well organized clean and easy to navigate there is a couple other options that are available online using a computer that are not available on this app such as adding alerts seeing actual checks that cleared overdraft protection authorization   there are a few items that you cannot read the entire line adding a wrap around feature would be helpful,1been using this app for years and find it very easy quick and convenient  i do almost all my banking on line between wells fargo bank of america and chase  and this chase app along with my other two allow me to get banking bill pay transfers done on the road in those little bits of time that would be otherwise wasted standing idle in lines etc thanks for bringing convenience and efficiency to my time deficient life,1on the grand scale this is not the worst app that there is however there are a few things that could be fixedadded the notification blips on the app icon i dont know there proper name wont go away even after i have opened the app the option to receive a notification on your daily balance would be nice as sometimes i forgot to checkthere are few more small things but thats the majority other than that the app isnt horrid but you wont get my other two stars until this app is better,1since i first downloaded this app there has been constant improvements to make it more user friendly i can access and manage my account quickly and easily i have had problems with the check deposit feature in the past though but have not had to use it in a couple of years so overall its a great way to manage your account on the move,1the chase app is solidly built in over two years of use only once did i experience a failure and it was noncritical  a simple reboot and it was working fine once again one caveat  change your password often as the app itself doesnt prompt you to do so making it easy to neglect regular password changes my favorite feature balance check without signing in  its a fast amp convenient way to check your finances without logging in for a full session,1i have nothing but good things to say about this app i use it to pay bills to schedule future payments ive used it to do wire transfers just about anything you can think of i only go to the bank when someone gives me a paper check and even then ive use the app to deposit they are even good about letting you know when the mobile site or app will be down for service cant recommend enough,1ive been banking with chase for about + years the mobile app is awesome since my phone is always in my pocket i always have access to my account now i only go to the bank if i need a hard copy of anything or to deposit bills it should also be noted that chase is always improving the app to better suit the needs of all their customers a good addition to the banking business,1i can do just about everything from this app that i can from the full site  this app is great for checking balances viewing activity and submitting payments if you bank with chase i recommend this appand always you can always call them on the phone chase always answers with a person who tells you their name where they are from and most importantly you dont have to press one for english,1love how useful and easy this app is ive always had it and recently had a couple checks and no time to go deposit it so i thought id try the mobile deposit i had taken the pictures then when i went to go review the information the routing number and account number were not mine i was confused but was able to change the account number but not the routing number i was too afraid it would be go through to another account so i didnt try,1downgraded to  stars get rid of the asking for a password when i initially logged into the app with a fingerprint if theres one thing that i love about chase bank its the investment they put into mobile most if not all of my banking is done through the mobile app which makes life that much easier the convenience of being able to complete banking tasks on my own time and in my own way really makes not only chase bank stand out but this app as well,0i dont have enough fingers to count the times that chase has let me down i had a  week battle with them just to prove i am who i say i am and recently they shut down a brand new debit card before i even activated it  their customer service department could care less every time i talk to them its really simple i work hard for my money when i want to use my money to pay bills or whatever i feel like i should be able to access my money an update to security that doesnt make the customer feel like a terrorist would definitely be appreciatedbut alas chase bank does not care about their customers just making money,1i like that i can do check deposits from home i love using quick pay  its a little clunky to check notifications  we have a credit card that we never use but it comes up as our primary account so i have to click through it to get to the notifications for our actual main account  i wish i could rearrange them or delete the card from the list  its also not very user friendly to delete messages once they are read,1i enjoy the app but as big as chase is my other creditors apps are significantly better for instance in order to see the due date of a bill one must select pay bill then enter your password if using touch id very inconvenient most of the bankingcredit apps i use show at a glance the due date of a bill and when i do want to pay the touch authentication to access the app is sufficient to make my payment i think chase can do better but thats just one individuals opinion and truly a grain of salt in a huge ocean of users,1i switched from bank of america and i couldnt be happier i also have the bank of america app because i still have my credit card with them and its the worst app i cant even pay my credit card bill i have to go online and do it chases app is user friendly really easy and i love how i can go paperless with my statements i also love how you can explore different credit cards and theres so many features,1i love my chase mobile appuse it every single day its a great easy way to keep track of my account balance i also love that there are many other features such as depositing checks so really the only reason you need to leave the house is to withdraw money i love chase quick pay it is just so convenient cant think of any negative things to say about this app so keep up the good work with your mobile banking chase,1it certainly does make life easier the fact that when you want to use certain features of the app after youve logged in using fingerprint recognition makes me feel safer anyone can get my fingerprint but not the whole password its tedious if you use those features all the time but hey its for my safety i love that i can snap a picture of a check and deposit it using the app i love quickpay its a great bank and app,0for a fortune  multinational bank to have not evolved into the twenty first centurythe app works ok once you get everything setup my biggest complaint is you cant add a pay from bank account on the app or even the mobile site you have to go online on a computer or trick your phone into using the full website before you can even add a pay account which is utterly ridiculous in the mobile day and age and for such a large bank that is something id expect from a small local bank without much web presence so what might not seem to be such a big deal screams to me the fact that they might not have all their ducks in a row,1love this app this app has been the best thing that has happened to me financially since i got chase i love being able to keep up with my money without having to always log on online especially with the verification nonsense chase makes you go through chase quickpay has literally changed my life lol but all in all i definitely recommend this app to anyone and everyone with chase  especially college students,0this app has proven to be a major pain in my sidei have to rely on it heavily because were i love there are no chase branches of atms and i have grown to hate it every tim i withdraw money im dinged  at the non chase atm and then chase charges me another  as a slap on the hand for needing my own money which turns out to be  to withdraw my own money their service is down on sundays so i cant make any check deposits on sundays iv had to change my password  times because sometimes it wont take my password i am so frustrated with chase that i cant wait to get back to state side to change my bank,1this app is better than any computer accessible website almost has the entire function ability as the full chase website it may use it to pay bills on the go transfer and quick payonly  complaint they need higher mobile check depositother than that ability to quick see your accounts is awesome,1this is extremely useful i love having the ability to check my balance quickly taking a snapshot of your check and depositing it is very quick and easy you can transfer money between accounts flawlessly i like being able to personalize the alerts the only thing it could improve upon is that the fingerprint verification would work each time you open the app sometimes that option doesnt pop up,1i enjoy using this app it provides me with all of the features i need for mobile banking that said i do agree with others that alerts navigation needs to be fixed it takes far too many taps to get to them and the inability to see which account of your multiple accounts has an alert is confusing additionally ive noticed that if you launch the app and it initiates the touch id login process then the app feedback prompt comes up if you choose to be reminded later so the prompt will go away then the touch id sign in doesnt come up again so i need to leave the app and launch it again to sign in with touch id very minor but still a little annoying otherwise i think its a very useful and visually appealing app and it seems like chase is improving it all the time,1the best banking app i have found yet account balances and changes are pretty quickly updated and deposit options are amazing love the deposit via photos saves time and gas overall its a simple and efficient app easily accessible and navigable only major things i would want incorporated into the app options for thumbprint logintouch id instead of the password required as well as adding an option for a section devoted to budgeting your finances,1pretty cool app not as simplistic as i would like for it to be but it does get the job done for those who utilize apps and mobile access to pay bills check balances and review activity seems perfect for my life since i am always on the go and usually not an pc until late at night takes you through several different screensoperations to make a payment seems a little unnecessary wish it was more of a one click option but it meets the need,1ive been with chase bank for almost  years and have never had an issue with their app i am a college student and utilize chase quickpay to get money from home its a great service included in the app i also like that i can deposit checks on my phone since there are limited atms near my new home its a great way to keep track of my account balances and anything else i would need to know about my accounts,1the chase app was great a few weeks ago but since the recent upgrade the app is no longer one of my favorite the quick pay update makes it more complicated to transfersend funds also the view that shows your recent  transactions is not  accurate so i would advise that you look at your monthly statements if you want to see all transactions with regards to your accounts if chase reverts back to there previous version i would give the app  stars but right now  it is,1i enjoy everything about this app its so great to be able to see my bank account details at any time  because i can check my account daily at anytime i was able to catch fraud on my account practically immediately the chase quick pay is excellent and the mobile check deposit is pretty great i only have trouble when the check backs are not lightly decorated  it suits my needs perfectly,1typical mobile onthego features that allow quick access to check balances make transfers pay bills etcive never had any issues with it other than depending on where i am sometimes it takes a while for it to load if at all it will just keep spinning and spinning in which case i figure im probably in a place that i probably dont want to open it up anyway,1this app is very useful gives lots of info amp allows you to do more than most banking apps you can do basically every thing you can on a computer the only reason i do not give it a full  stars is that it needs a few tweaks for user friendliness like how it constantly asks for a review when it does it disables the fingerprint unlock option until you completely close out the app other than that amp a few other minor changes this is an excellent app,1this app is a dependable app when monitoring your on line balance it is current with your banking balance i have had other banks and their apps which left me aggravated and in the dark regarding transactions considering on line banking and dependability its pretty goodif the bank had a program similar to the bank that has keep the change and the speed accuracy of that bank then i would rate this bank with  stars,1i have no complaints to add on this app it manages to provide me with all the services i expect it to provide i especially like depositing my checks in my home the improvements over the last few years have influenced my decision to update my review i have removed my comments on the alert accessibility since  chase has updated the app to provide easier access to the notifications cheers chase and the app writers good work,1this is probably the single most used app on my phone can access everything with ease i love that i can use quickpay and depositing checks with it this app is probably the only reason im still with chase to be completely honest ive been thinking of divesting from big banks for a couple of years and will probably do it soon but losing access to this app for my transactions makes it hard,1this app is very easy to use you can save receipts of credit card payments credit line is reflected immediately upon payment balance takes into consideration pending account details are easy to access the bad reviews on here disregard this app is very helpful updates are to keep you information safe wish everyone understood that much better than all other banking apps out there,1chase has a good app i rarely need to go into the bank you can deposit checks make balance transfers and manage other chase products such as credit cards and rewards redemption all at the click of a button i appreciate the iphone finger print scanning feature to access my account info as well if you bank with chase you should be using this app,1the chase app provides easy access to my banking information i particularly enjoy the check scanning and activity alerts as a fun bit of whimsy you wouldnt expect from a massive bank the opening screen shows a fun local photo based on where you are at the moment even if youre in one of the few places chase doesnt have a branch,1usually the app is fine and i do most of my banking transactions in the app and rarely step into a branch unless i need a banker however it always seems like when i am in dire need of my information that i cant log in also the acct preview is no longer an option and that was one of the best features to have to fully log in just to check balances is a bit annoying and this feature disappeared without warning after an app update its not the worst app but could be better,1for the most part a very useful app which i highly recommend if you have a chase account that being said i initially activated text alerts for deposits and withdrawals ever since i upgraded my gs to a s i longer receive text alerts even though the feature shows on in settings so i turned on email alerts which only work sporadically at best its a shame it doesnt work consistently as its a very useful feature to monitor your account to protect against fraudulent transactions if chase fixes this theyd get  stars from me,1the chase app is easy to use i like the check deposit except for needing to verify the account number accuracy it should be automatic  as i already identified by signing in    the display of credit card transactions and balances is very helpful to manage the account    i am waiting for updated security features like fingerprinting to log on  for the most part it is a good app needs to be changed to be more current with security features and notifications,1use this app mainly to schedule payments and get spending notifications very good fingerprint signin is convenient not quite  stars since it would be better for payments to default to the due date instead of the current date and default to the last payment option chosen for previous payments minimum statement balance etc that way it would be frictionless through the screens,1overall its a very good app there are  things that would make it better alerts highlight the account that generated the alert if you have multiple accounts you dont know which one triggered the alert and you have to check one at a time  check deposits automatically take the picture once the check is in focus and get rid of the reminder to now take a picture of the back,1it took about  attempts for the appchases system to finally accept a rebate check  i tried standing to take the picture of the check as suggested by the app and finally got it to be accepted while taking sitting picture of my checkconsidering i am using an iphone  with a superior camera and that this check should have been easier for the system to process because it was was printed by computer and not handwritten this app obviously needs some workimprovementsits a decent start but chase needs to imporve the appbanking systems ability to recognize amp process checks  if they can improve the recognition this will be an amazing addition to an already very good banking appwithout the deposit feature i would give the app  stars  considering the deposit feature of the app doesnt seem to be ready for prime time i dropped my review down to  stars,1i like the basic parts of the app however the alert system drives me nuts i get this little indicator number on the app ok i go to app and login now the indicator is on more ok i guess i click more and get a menu nothing indicates where the count item comes from should be shown next to alerts it takes me two more menus to get to the active alertsare alerts important i would say yes that is why the number is shown on the app so why is it so complicated to get to them,0overall good application i loved the remote deposit feature that allowed me to make a deposit by taking a picture of the check however this feature is not working well since the previous to last update it looks like that the program defaults the first digit of of the check amount to the  sign thus if the check quantity does not include the  sign it is not read correctly i informed about this bug but i am not sure if the problem was understood the rep recommended to delete the app and install it again which i did without success please fix,1i love the app convenient and it has much more modern design the only issues i have are  when i click on activity it sends pending for about  days  sometimes i really need to transfer money from savings to checking on the weekends and i cant and  i wish that i could see pictures of the checks i deposit through the app after i submit them other than that everything works and looks great just fix those three things and itd be good to go,1im very impressed with this app it is easy to monitor my spending on the go and keeps me honest with myself  now that i have it on my iphone i have no excuses for not knowing whats in my checking acct  i havent had the guts to try the feature that allows me to take a picture of my check and then deposit it into my acct but i have that as an option  i definitely recommend downloading it  i didnt give the app five stars because i have not used that deposit feature i mentioned above,1love this app the ability to pay bills online and check statements through this app makes it incredibly convenient and comfortable to track credit history i also enjoy knowing my point balance as well as having the ability to access each abs every transaction made i would however find it necessary to have option to view a more in depth description of certain transactions when that information is wanted,1i love the look and ease of the app my only problem is the chase freedom section tracking is difficult because purchases dont update as quickly as they do for checking or savings accounts so the balance usually takes almost a week to reflect purchases also the ultimate rewards points are only updated every quarterhow are you supposed to know where youre at it is frustrating i would give  stars if this was fixed to be faster however for basic accounts the app is great,1i have found this app enjoyable to use efficient and i like the new look  there have been times when i have had trouble making a deposit from my phone and i dont really like the way i have to clear my alerts but overall its a really good app  i can check my acct at any time transfer money pay bills amp check my credit card for fraudulent charges its very convienent kudos to the creators of this app for chase,0this app serves all of my mobile needs except depositing checks aside from having the ability to view my acct activity this is the most important function i need even though the app professes to be able to do this i have been unable to take a pic of a check and deposit it i get an error message every time and at this point ive stopped trying this is so frustrating that im almost ready to change banks my partner has wells fargo and never has a problem with this feature i keep looking for an update to the app hoping it will be fixed but no such luck heres to hoping,1i recently moved states and had to get a new bank i was a little worried about such a huge bank seeing as im used to small towns and credit unions but believe it or not one of the deciding factors was how user friendly the app was im continually on the go and i needed the app to move as quickly as i do and i found it i also love that theres no charge for depositing funds electronically and how well the set up for that is like the title says so far im lovin it,1i love the convenience of doing most of my major banking needs on my phone i seldom visit the bank now because of this application i love the bill pay and quick pay services suggestion to developers i wish checks issued or checks deposited can be viewed id also like the app to do fraud alert in emails or texting other than that i enjoy this user friendly app and would highly recommend it to others,1very handy and can complete most thingsa lot of stuff just a few improvementsi would like be able to search by name of direct depositer cant do this online eitherhow about a red banner when you are  savings transfer away from being charged but then people would know and not make a transfer and chase would make less  in feesi wish the payments could be applied any time  i mean why dont weekends count it is electronic no one is at an office physically accepting these paymentswould like to be able to schedule recurring payments via the app instead of just on full website onlineoverall chase is more customer geared and waaaay more tech savvy then other banksbut as with all banks how about thinking of the little guy once and a while instead of just the whales with high account balances,1i really love this app very helpful i dont live close to a chase so being able to deposit via my phone is amazing and the turn around time is great the only problem i have is i would love to be able to view checks like you can online i usually only have my phone so to view written and deposited checks would be amazing if this is already possible please show me how to do thisstill a great app though,0loved this app when it first came out used to deposit checks using my phone all the time just snap a photo and boom youre good to go but now i have the same issue at others have said below i input the amount select what account to deposit into and then take a photo exactly as the app describes but once the photo is taken you have two choices use and retake neither button works so i can no longer deposit checks using my phone which was the primary reason i used the app before if you cant update your app and still have basic functions work maybe you shouldnt be in the app game,0cause it doesnt seem like you do to get user feedback everyones been complaining about the quick deposit feature not working i thought it would be fixed with this update but no it isnt this used to be a great app but now its just a waste of space on my phone my main reason to have it was to deposit my checks because the nearest branch isnt exactly around the corner and now it doesnt even make sense to have it if the quick deposit doesnt work sorry but until quick deposit is fixed youre getting a one star review for poor customer service and responsiveness,0i have deposited dozens of checks before and for the last week it will not let me when i take a photo of the check the use and retake buttons do not work its like they are not even programmed to be buttons the app is not frozen or lagging it just isnt a button i can hit the back arrow anytime and it takes me back to the initial page it is so frustrating to have it not work id rather have the app crash every time that just do nothing at all when i rely on it to deposit my checks i uninstalled and redownloaded the app and it fixed nothing iphone slike everyone else having the same issue gt,1this is a really great app the design is terrific and it is responsive so i was really surprised to see a lot of negative reviews have you ever tried the wells fargo app  good lord that thing is a wreck in contrast the chase app is one of the best on my iphone of any apps with that said i intended to write a review to ask the developers to please implement touch id amex has that and its really great to me one of the few things missing in the chase app other than that ive noticed that the cash accounts now show a running balance thank you but credit card accounts do not i also need it on credit accounts to properly reconcile with my own tracking of spending last it would be really awesome if the app could export csv files so i could analyze spending in a spreadsheet  overall a great app keep it up thanks,1this lackluster app can be used to view your balance but if you wanted mobile banking this isnt really the best this app compares very poorly with discovers app there is no feedback option on the app maybe they dont care what we think so ill list the features needed here touch id notification center widget profile update verification of device from the app easier discovery for statements better all around design all aspects are hidden except the balance so you have to really look for everything else otherwise it works,1i love the ability to deposit checks and make transfers right from the app the app gets the job done in pretty much every way that mattersi have a rather lengthy password for security purposes  since they have now enabled touchid i dont have to enter that password every single time to login to my account  just pop my finger on the home button and im all setits not a huge deal but one thing that i would change is the ability to delete alerts once i review them  since i have  accounts when i get an alert i never know which account it is for and i have to search through my accounts and alerts to find the new one the ability to delete an alert would declutter and allow me to better manage themall in all though it is a great app and chase has been a really good bank,1very easy to use especially when short on time to pay bills quick pay transfer money amp just checking the activity one thing i wish can be expanded on is the activity information it only shows what fits in the screen and you can click on it or turn the screen to see full description its helpful when figuring where the charge is from,1chase mobile banking app has recently added some new features including balance preview and access via touchid but the event handling of the latter needs some uiux improvements i feel the all or nothing approach adds very little in the way of usability as you still have to input your password to get passed the transactionpay wall my opinion of the feature current stands as a novel way to clear your notifications but still a solid banking app,1this app has truly been such a great way to manage my money regardless of where i am located it helped me pay bills transfer money on the go and check my statements when i am away from hometraveling setting alerts on your app allows you to constantly know and be aware of what is being withdrawn and what is being added you can keep track of your money as freely and often as you would prefer,1in addition to chase i have the bank of america app and i find chases quicker and easier to use in most ways i love the touchid login because i never feel like typing my rather long and complex password the user interface is appealing and fast and adapts to my locale one improvement i would crib from b of a is the automatic shutter when the check is positioned correctly in the camera but really how lazy is that it cant really ding this apps score,1the chase app is easy to use has great features like being able to see your balance by swiping to the right from the login screen the fingerprint login and the check deposit through the app  i also dont really worry about security too much when i use it  it gives you a sense of security to check your account from anywhere   thank you for making my life easier,1the amount of information available through this app is amazing i can check all my accounts make deposits see past statements easily pay bills and now see a capture of cleared checks  yes if you initiate a transfer you have to enter your password even with touch id  but i find that a small irritation for the added security step  if youve used other bank apps they pale in comparison this app is wonderful,1weather you are transferring money paying a credit card down quick paying depositing a check or just checking in on your accounts  this app allows you to do all these things and more from anyplace in the world my favorite feature is check deposit which is a huge time saver five stars from me for this app which saves you trips to the bank and is very easy to use,1my favorite part of the app if you have an iphone  and above you can use the fingerprint to access the app this gives me more peace of mind and is just quicker to log in for me app is pretty easy to navigate through and make payments if you have a chase credit card it makes it super easy to schedule a payment on it i definitely recommend this app is you bank with chase,0a sad experience that really show cases how little chase cares about their customers financial success and how very little they are willing to go above and beyond to improve their customers lives to create products that have  great experiences   this app can not  even give you the available balance of your credit card  you need to do the math your self look up credit limit  look up current balance sum up all the pending transaction from the transaction history then deduct current balance from credit limit  then deduct the pending transaction sum from the result of the previous result ,1i love the app in general i love how it has the preview and how easy it is to access using your fingerprintif you have fingerprint use as an option on your smartphone not many banks have the touch id for access the only thing i dont really like is how boring it is to actually go into the message center every single time a password is required it would be so much easier if that was accessed with touch id too but besides this absolutely ,1i use this app a lot can do nearly all of my online banking business accounts using the app so rarely have to login on my computer i use quickpay to send and receive money can approve transactions others in my workgroup have entered this is fantastic send wires and set up payments i tried to set up fingerprint recognition but after  or  logins it just stopped working so now i have to type in my login not a big deal but it would be nice if it worked overall i love it,1this app allows you to see statements view a pending payment on my credit card which is great for me since i set them up in advance but then receive an email reminder to pay so always like to double check both view and redeem reward points shop through the app to earn extra points and of course see activity  it is smooth clear and hasnt crashed on me,1now that i can view check images through the app im even happier the only other change id love to see is the ability to pay bills without submitting each individual payment when paying through online bill pay i can process multiple then submit all at once would be great to do the same other than that never have a problem makes my life much simpler,1this a great app i am able to do all of my banking while mobile i save tons of time being able to pay bills online transfer money by logging in or by text if notified all of my accounts are synced including my chase credit cards everything is right there when i log in i love this app and i love banking with chase i have been with them for over ten years and i have not had one problem,1chase seems to be really good at creating innovations for banking and then quickly incorporating them into the mobile app love the quick peek into accounts sending money with quick pay scheduling bill payments etc without having to get to a computer to do it i used to bank with pnc and they didnt have half the features available on mobile that chase does very pleased,1weve been chase customers for more years than we can remember started as bank  and stayed when chase acquired them weve tried others never closing this one though and all have proved disappointing fees that were hidden rude customer service and their online banking was way behind what chase offers the mobile app is way above and beyond what anyone else offers very easy to use and understand,1i love this app fingerprint recognition to log in for iphones the ability to pay bills deposit checks and the ability to refine the notifications are my fav features for instance i set mine to notify me of any transactions over  and the notice pops up within seconds of the transaction makes monitoring your account really easy i havent had to step foot in the bank for a long time this app does it all,1i love this app its easy to use convenient and i can do everything at the tip of my finger its nice to know if i last minute need to transfer money from my other account to my chase account that its easy to do with just a couple pictures and boom its done also love the alert section to keep me in check with everything going in and out with my account very lovely feature chase all the way ,1the chase app is very user   very secure to use i very rarely go to an actual branch for service i can do everything from quick paying someone to depositing a check to transferring funds to a different account all from the comfort of my own home  i follow a very tight budget and find that i have no problems keeping to it with this app ive spoken with friends that bank elsewhere and their apps are not as versatile as the chase app,1i really enjoy this app because it allows me to manage my transfers im even able to transfer to a different bank to this app which is great i did have to set that up on the computer first though the only thing i wish i could do from the app is schedule a transfer that is recurring i also live like a map of chase atm if thats already included i havent figured it out so sorry anyway if those two things were added i probably give it a five star,1this app is helpful when i need to check my balance and pay bills online simple to use and i havent had a problem with it the only thing is that they seem to have taken away the quick view feature where you can just swipe to the right and see your current balance without logging in that was really convenient for me otherwise its a fantastic app good job chase,1this app hides the available credit amount from the first screen and basically makes you guess how to find it also payments made to the card do not post immediately as they do on my american express card furthermore chase does not approve a charge that is even  above the available limit amex seemingly has an allowed percentage extra so you dont get denied payment for your prescriptions at walgreens for example just because the charge might take you over the limit by a few bucks,1i have been using this app for what five years and never had any issue with it it has more functionality than other banking apps and is always up to date with account info between this and the text to bank options chase has i am never unable to accomplish what i need to remotely i havent even had to set foot in a chase bank in years because i can do everything from my phone,0this is an annoying frustrating app every time theres an update my login info disappears recently they improved it so that you can use the finger print scan to access your account i love itexcept you still need a password to get to your messages and alerts hello did i stop being me in the split second since i gave you my fingerprint to access my account why would i need to now enter my password again to get whatever message you have left is a message really that much more confidential than every other part of my account ridiculous,0ive been using this app for a while now and never had an issue photographing and depositing checks through the app but today my wife and i could not get it to work at all it kept giving the message of not clear enough when it is extremely clear tried different backgrounds getting close up and further away nothing works im currently in a place where there isnt any chase branches to go and deposit it at not sure if its a localized issue or the app as a whole if this continues i doubt ill keep banking with chase as this feature was a major reason we started banking with them,1i love that i can deposit a check via my cell phone through the app i can transfer money between accounts and pay off my credit card each month theres no reason to go to the bank unless i need cash which is not often excellent piece of technology making our lives easier,1like the convenience and overall utility but regularly get error messages about unable to connect to chase try again later when trying to do deposits  not our internets fault usually requires some chase app update i didnt know about though i update the phone regularly worst is that when you want to try again later you have to reshoot the check and reenter the data even if app left open makes me think i should go to a branch in person it would probably be faster,1i have had this app since it came out and i cant say enough good things i recently had my wallet and purse stolen and being able to sign in and see purchased items almost immediately kept the damages to a minimumi am able to transfer money pay bills and everything else i need at any time the security has been amazing alsoi highly recommend to any chase customer,1i have always really liked this app i almost like it better than the online banking im glad that the format didnt change too much in the last update as the overall new look took a little getting used too im a fan of consistency and appreciate that chase doesnt always feel like they have to reinvent the wheel when it comes to their online services simple and easy to use,1i enjoy using this app it is user friendly and i can view my account and pay my bill with ease i like the ability to pay my bill using multiple accounts too its a must have for chase users however i give it only  stars because i own an iphone and i miss the ability to use the touch enable feature to access my account this forces me to always have to remember my password what an inconvenience when needing to access my account in a flash,1since the primary function i use is check deposit my focus is on that portion of the app most of the time it works smoothly however occasionally it rejects a check when you can clearly see it read the routing and account number correctly with the check signed and deposit phraseology correct the other very minor irritation is the need to insert a decimal point when it should automatically point off the last digits,0it took me like  tries to deposit a check though every picture looked fine in the preview and the system reported the corrected routing and account numbers off the check it waited until the very end to tell me the photos werent clear and made me start over from scratch so annoying ive had zero problems depositing checks with other banking appsthe other thing that drives me nuts is it lets you login with touch id but its useless  all you can do is look any transaction requires the password might as well not even bother supporting touch id,1i love this app its so easy to do almost anything like make payments or deposit checks without going to a branch i also love the touch id login i actually lived in hawaii which has only local hawaiian banks and no nationwide banks like chase citibank or bank of america for  yrs it was because of this app that i was able to live for  years keeping chase as my bank without opening an account in any of the local banks,1i use the app to deposit checks mostly and appreciate the constant improvements chase makes when i deposited today there were fewer clicks to complete the deposit which is always appreciated  occasionally have issues getting the quality of photo they require even though the pix look the same to me  but thats well worth eliminating a trip to the atm  now if they could just figure out how to dispense cash via an iphone it would be perfect,1i love the fact that chase is always innovating and making use of technology to make their product that much better for the end usertouch id is a recent great add making logging in that much faster and easier i use this app daily and compared to other banks i have it is the easiest to navigatenow there is even the ability to view statements on the mobile app as well as checks and withdrawal slips,0the app was useful and provided quick reference to my acct but since the update there is nothing simple about the app i cant even access up to the day information on my acct the only access is the ability to view my last statement which is outdated the only feature of the new update that i like is the new touch id login i used to sign in more regularly to check and rectify my accounting with recent transactions now i login to pay down my acct and have to login from my laptop to do anything else poor planning on this update a rollback would be a huge improvement,1i only really use it to check and pay my balances i wish it had an alert to let me know when my refunds are posted into my account and when my available balance gets updated also i wish there was a way to send a new message i always have to use my old messages to send a new one but luckily the customer service responds back so its oklastly i wish chase wasnt so slow with processing pending transactions theyre slower than synchrony and golden ,1i am an iphone user and have had the app since it came out  not once have i had any issue with the finger print maybe the ones complaining with the iphones need to get new phones  ive never had to change my password through the app or online  it sounds like the ones complaining just like to complain about things  nothing on here is complicated  the app is awesome with no problems,1i really like this app for transferring money to and from my kids debit cards it makes it very easy to monitor what they are spending money on and to compensate them when they do something for the household like buy groceries the other great feature is depositing checks you can take a picture of the check through the app and do the deposit without ever leaving your house,0app never works if it ever allows me to deposit a check its only after ive reinstalled the app three times every time i try to make a deposit tried calling customer service at least four times on this issue and every time they say i am the only person who has ever had this problem that theyll start an inquiry to fix and that they will call me in  hours with a resolution needless to say they have never called me with a solve to this problem nearest chase bank is  hour drive away so only solution is to switch banks worst app ever and terrible customer service on this issue avoid at all cost if you can nothing but enraging app,1app is quick lots of quick links to where i need to go and no confusing layout felt natural first time i used it i can hardly remember anything about this app which means i got in did my business and logged off  all of that with limited recollection means it is set up streamlined and smooth i didnt have to work around the site to take care of my business   nice clean effective  efficient thank you smh,1i do mostly all of my banking with this app and i love it from balance checking to quick pay to being able to deposit clients check via the app  unless its getting maintenanced and so much more i pretty much rely on this app to keep track of my finances and it hasnt let me down thanks chase you did goodbtw i see people having issues but everything works correctly on my iphone and ipad ,1this app lets me do everything i need to do very easily i get in with my fingerprint and then i can transfer money between accounts and deposit checks since i have a few kids who have accounts as well and a couple of them are away at college this is extremely convenient for me i also like being able to see where my money is going when i spend it electronically ,1this is one of the best apps ever the complaints ive read sound bizarre to me and just a clear sign of how lazy and entitled people have become i can do everything on here and never have to step foot in a bank or go on their website if i ever have a problem i simply call and they take care of it immediately its designed to make banking easier people not to clean your house make your meals or plan your vacations  get real,1this app was going great for me until my wife and i realized that you are unable to complete the quick deposit process because the app will not allow ipod touch users to take a complete picture of the check  it only allows you to take a picture of  of the check and that is pretty annoying  this is a major flaw and the reason why it doesnt get  stars  hopefully they will have this fixed soon as they have had more than enough time to resolve the issue,0i really like the app its very helpful being able to check my accounts transfer funds and even deposit checks my only real problem with this app right now is that the push notifications keep piling up right now the app shows that i have  notifications even though ive checked them on the phone and online as well ive tried turning off push notifications on the chase website but that constantly errors out on me preventing me from actually turning them offits a small issue thats very annoying to me,1its great when it works  frequent connectivity issues on strong wifi and cellular though  whatever connectivity issues are occurring also seem to affect their mobile safari website  ive tried the iphone and ipad mobile safari sites and when the app connection issue happens it seems across their ios and safari mobile interfaces whatever connection i use but regular full site works fine from same connections,1ive been a long time user of this app ever since i could do everything from depositing checks by phone transfer funds quick pay i havent been to a branch in over a year it has its quirks but overall there is no other bank that gives me the tremendous ability to bank on the go customer support has been outstanding and the developers have done a great job,0i have been quite patient but after downloading an update it still says unable to connect please try again later it has worked two or three random times in over a month i really rely on banking online and particularly through my phone i didnt have any problems at all until january i dont know what theyre doing but its getting worse and they should just stop i am seriously considering switching banks im happy with everything else but the lack of mobile accessibility really is putting chase in the technological dark ages ill give it until march i hope they fix it soon that update did nothing,1remember  years ago when there was no such thing as apps and you had to balance your check book suffer from overdraft fees if you didnt and go all the way to the bank for every little thing or how about calling the number at the back of your card only to be told no one is available nope me neither thanks to this chase app it is literally my life i use it at least once a day thank you,1i really enjoy the new looks of this app theres only one thing that doesnt make sense to me when theres a notification and you click to view it once you see your accounts listed the notification goes away and have no idea which account has pending notifications anymore the user should be able to see which accounts have notifications pending to be reviewed,1i live this application and all of the notifications you can set to come right through your devices only thing i wish you could do is manually add a transaction such as when writing a check so that way you can have an accurate balance at all times sometimes you forget a check is out there and i dont always have a check register around otherwise i love the app great job chase,1i am new to chase and have to say that this app is icing on the cake of my bank switching experience i have multiple accounts and honestly the ease with which i can transfer money is fantastic  cell phone deposits have always worked i do wish the limits were higher  location finder is awesome  its a solid banking app  looking forward to all the ways the developers will continue to improve this app,1i dont use many of the extra features of this app i check my balance i make a payment i may have forgotten i makeaccept quick pay payments tofrom friends for all those instances this app is perfect i can not speak to the security alerts as i dont use them through the app and the color of the interface is fine personally i would change it per region or season but whatever it is just an interface to do what i need done on the go,0sometimes youre able to deposit check with this app and sometimes youre not a while back i was not able to deposit them and i waited a while to see if the company would fix the app and its been a couple weeks now and no updates with fixes have been made i see mostly poor reviews for the app which means a lot of people seem to be frustrated with the app and the company is unresponsive to their consumers opinions so im writing a review to let them know that their app pretty much is lame if you cant deposit checks and they should invest some of the dollars their investors  are giving them and create a better app jeez,1as easy to use as my iphone ive never used a better app nor have i been better cared for by any bank in the past i am more than pleased by the ease of use and performance of this  app than any other app on my phone i highly recommend chase bank and their app for top notch service and support they have been absolutely wonderful from the beginning and they continue to do so to this day god bless you chase bank,1most actions you want to do are easy steps thru the app love the pic deposits so i dont have to drive all the way to a branch live in the country but some pathways are convoluted amp hard to remember like when i want to increase the amount on a biweekly transfer i have set up  takes me  minutes just to remember how to do it because its not an easy obvious path of steps to take like almost everything else otherwise very good app makes my life easier thanks ,1they implemented touchid but you still need your password to do anything except review information  you still arent told if a check you deposit via the camera gets rejected after its accepted in the app so if there is a problem you still get physical mail days later telling you about it with little helpful detail especially if you deposited a number of checks the alerts are pretty great and really quick just as long as you dont want to go into the apps message center and try to figure out what your alert was for its a maze and even if you find it you arent always rewarded with a lot of detail about the transaction if you have chase its a super handy app theres no reason not to get this but its not going to be as great as youd think it should be,1i am a loyal chase customer keeping my bank account even when i moved to nc where there are no chase banks in the entire state the app has been great for me to do mobile checking with but i do have one major complaint the limit on the amount you can deposit with the app is too low i am renting out my house and it is a pain to have to mail checks to my parents to deposit for me because of the limit on app deposits please increase the limit,1ive been using the app for quite a while and had no complaints with the previous version but this new version has a very nice look to it a very nice user interface i use it to deposit checks on a regular basis works like a charm also have transferred funds and done a few other things all works very well very nice to use for finding an atm now with the touch id its even more convenient,1i have  banking apps amp the chase app beats them all hands down its easy quick amp extremely efficient depositing checks is a snap amp the deposit is accepted quickly other banks deposit functions are tedious constantly show not working amp if you can finally get a check deposited make you wait days before the funds are available i wish all bank apps worked like the chase app its the absolute best,0this app used to be great but after my last update i noticed that it is riddled with bugs  the most frustrating one is that i cant ever log in because the chase app says it doesnt recognize my mobile device i have to request the app to text me a unique log in pin every single time i want to log into the app i can literally log in one time with the requested pin press the home screen go directly back into the app and still the same result we do not recognize your mobile device please request a pin to log in  extremely frustrating,1the chase app is amazing friends are finally okay with spotting you for cash because you can just instantly pay them back with the quick pay feature it makes paying for sorority tshirts soooo much easier it also makes receipts almost obsolete because you can view all your transactions and both account on one screen fraud alerts as well happy to be banking with chase,1im overall satisfied with all of its functions and how quickly transactions and deposits are updated im able to use quickpay to transfer funds to my family through this app and it also offers a screen preview of your account balance which is my favorite option because sometimes we just dont have the time to type out our passwords i only gave it  stars because it crashes on me from time to time,1chase does a great job embracing technology and this app is case in point the balances are always updated they make it very easy to bill pay from the phone the only issues i see is that the alerts can be a bit much if you have more than one account but that is probably a setting i can adjusti just havent looked for it overall a very clean and convenient app,1im not a great fan of chase but ill give them this they use technology better than any bank i can think of the chase mobile app is fantastic easy to readuse lots of features including all sorts of custom alerts regarding your account plenty of transaction details and dont forget the deposit by phone feature cant really back the bank but if you have accounts with them this app is pretty much perfect,1the app is good but i also bank with another provider whose app i think is superior you cannot deposit checks directly from an account you have to pull up the menu to deposit a check  when taking pictures of the check you have to specifically go in to do the front and then go into do the back where the other app i work with you can go from the front to the back very easily  i think they could simplify the steps between actions,1with a few minor changes this app could be great please stop making me enter a password after ive already signed in with a finger print add someplace to report a lost or stolen card why do i get double emails every time i make a payment or send money and it would be great to be able to see an actual statement on the app compared to other banking apps this one is by far more user friendly and dependable its a really good app and i know itll teach great before any others do,1super easy and up to date info if my card is swooped the app knows instantly i can pay my chase credit card from my debit account just by pressing a few buttons and entering the amount i want to pay i can keep track of all my cards usage and balances as well as set up text messageemail alerts for all sorts of things with quite a few different options i enjoy this app very much,1i love the mobile chase app which make every banking function clear and fast allowing me to immediately take care of mobile deposits bill pay or checking balance it also prevents you from making silly errors with their clear layout and steps i have multiple accounts and it is still easy i still like to go into my branch office but just to pick up cash or say hi,1this app does all the basic functions i need and does it well i use it quite often and have only noted issues where it did not prompt me for finger print authentication  i had to close and reopen it to prompt me  overall i am pleased with this app  if i could offer one item to improve it would be to include travel notification setup for debit and credit card usage while traveling,1i love using the chase app its easy and i can deposit move money etc with ease the only problem i have with it is having to enter my password to make transactions once im verified through finger print this never made sense if my finger print is accepted why would i need to use a password once i enter the app if you need verification again just let me use my finger print again doesnt that make more sense instead of having to enter the password i hope they change this because i find it annoying,1i use this app at least once a week ive never had a problem with quick pay its great if you go out and one person picks up the tab you can just transfer bucks over and its done in a minute love that also ive set up text alerts on a deposits so i know exactly when i will have money available this is functional fast and simple thanks chase for not being like boa,1like a few others i use the chase app frequently and find it very easy to use as well as wellthoughtout i would still recommend that chase allow users to link multiple accounts that are set to pay bills so that whether one of us or the other schedules a payment we can both see it in the queuemost recent updates to put banner ads on some pages thumbs down,1good app ive never really had an issue with it i love the check deposit feature i would like it if they had more optionsfeatures from the direct site on the mobile app i would like to have the feature of being able to hideunhide accounts on the mobile app as im able to on the desktop site it would make it a lot easier to navigate through my accounts hopefully they make that an option for the mobile app thanks,1if all you want to do is check on your account balances deposit checks and pay bills youll be fine with this app  if you also want to manage your account by changing account details address email password etc or by viewing your notifications youll be horribly disappointed the first isnt possible and the second lumps everything into one location then when you open it theyre split with no indication where the notifications are,1i have been a chase customer for about  years and being able to bank online was a plus but this app is even more awesome many family members have chase so the quick pay feature is a plus we can all get together order out or whatever and just easily send each other the money i can quickly check my balance add a payee all with one hand sweet,1i was considering a  star review but i couldnt think of why this app doesnt deserve  stars i appreciate being able to deposit checks with my phone from anywhere and i can do anything else i need to from this app as well this app is the gold standard and other banks are playing catch up i wont use it much longer though since chase continues to penalize me for being too poor,1i love the app over all but the additional step of having to type in my password to pay my bill seems a bit excessive and unnecessary if anyone were to ever break into my app the last thing i would worry about them doing is paying my bill no other credit card app i have requires this plus if its going to stay around why not link it to my touch id so i dont have to physically type it in every time,0so i have been with chase for  years and have two accounts and have been late on a payment but here i am at disney and this app wont help me fix them denying our disney bands from working over being a few bucks from the credit limit i have been over the credit limit + times but here i am out of town and yes i could ride a bus back to the resort and change the registered card but really almost  years and this is how i am treated my bank of america and suntrust cards never do this i rate this app poorly because it supports a firm that doesnt care about long term customers we are mere minions in their master plan,0disappointed in new updates i feel quickpay is less secure now because you dont have to approve or deny money coming in and out of account please bring back this feature the more security the better especially for a bank i do not understand eliminating that step of accepting or denying money it is only one step amp gives me extra peace of mind i already have a hard time keeping track of it but when i had the ability to approve money i was more aware of what was happening in my account now its all automatic amp thats not cool amp certainly doesnt seem safe,1ive been using chase online for many years and found it to be very intuitive and convenient  i downloaded the chase app on my iphone a couple weeks ago and have been checking my account every other day now without having to open my laptop  compare to the older version they have improved it a lot and the experience is on par with the online application  great job chase,1the app is very useful i use the mobile version often in order to reconcile my checking account i would usually print the most recent transactions and verify the entries in my registerfor some reason chase has decided to remove the  print feature it was better than printing the monthly statement because it was current showed the running balances and was easy to use please bring back the print feature so that i can have an uptothe minute report of my banking history,1i signed up with chase as i was moving from a small town and had been using a small local bank that was not national so i needed a new bank signed up with chase only to find out there was no chase branch within  miles of my new home not a problem as long as you use this app i deposit checks transfer money chase quick pay rocks i havent been into a chase bank in years great app,1deposited checks available next day touch id for logging in quick pay is faster i can pay all my bills from the app its perfect i like the minimalist design on the preview page and inside the app i would like to see the same design on the home page instead of the outdated white square also moving the menu button to the bottom perhaps floating so its easier to access with the thumb,1i am so impressed with this app  i have been using it for a long time and i get text messages the instant my card is used it is accurate and dependable my credit cards have been compromised several times and i am able to call them immediately when that happens i cant wait for finger print technology to replace swiping the card or inserting the chip on the card,0i used this app constantly most often to deposit checks i am paid while im on the road since the update no matter how brightly lit and clear of a picture i take of the check i get the error that the check isnt clear enough and i need to take the picture again it hasnt worked once i used to take pix in dim light the check was still clear but not as clear as im taking now with my iphone  and it always worked great looks like they broke it with this update if it isnt fixed soon i dont see the point in this app at all writing a review because customer service wasnt helpful at all,0i have been wanting to write a raving review for a long time but as of late i am so disappointed  i deposit checks all the time with the mobile app  that is one of the reasons i opened a chase bank account  before if a signature went below the line and was on top of the account number you were able to type in the correct number  but now you cant  you have to cancel the transaction  thus causing you to have to make a trip to the bank   and it doesnt matter if the check is for  or   if its  it may cost you that much in gas to go to the bank  very aggravating  and im really disappointedmary kay moore,0this app has more errors and breakdowns than their atms  the deposit feature only works  of the time and when you call customer service they do nothing in fact theyll slap about   fees in your account and say to bad go to your branch next time im on the road so i need a deposit feature ive now saved screen shots of the error codes and unavailability messages to show my personal banker who fortunately understands my frustration  ultimately this app is another way for the bank to make money off its customers and they dont support or back up its horrible ineffectiveness to make its customers mobile,1i can pay my bills and yes there are some limitations compared to the online website but apps typically do not offer all the feature that the website does dont know why that is but there must be a reason like seeing credit card or banking statements and greater detail but as an app its reliable and accurate for what i need from my banking app which is simple information ability to make deposits and pay bills thanks chase,1it absolutely works for me for all things i want to do i can do quick pay deposit checks online check balances tranfer money without any trouble yes it does what other people says about pending deposits or other transactione but i guess it has to do it and its okay as long as you know your balances and what you supposed to have spend or deposited it works well for me and and my necessities ive been with chase since  never had any problem with them,1i have been using this chase app for over  years now works great never crashesonly intermittent problem is if you add a new fingerprint to your iphone you have to first login with your user id and password all transactions show up immediately once they are completed also if you upgrade you must first login with user id and password one of the few apps which works as its intended to great job chase developers,1i love the app because it allows me to keep up with my monthly expenses statements and activities my only issue is that the statements are hard to understand if you made it easier to give a purchase date amount the item description balance owed and payments would make it a lot easier to decipher    after the above comment regarding the way the statement information being hard to read you guys made it a lot easier job well done thank you,0still not workingi can only sign in even with fingerprint successful  times before it says i have tried to sign in unsuccessfully too many times  i know my password because i save it every time i change it     may ive had this app for a while now but in the last  months to a year every other time i log in it locks me out saying i have logged in using the wrong password too many times  i know this is not correct because i store my password every time i change it  im pretty  technically sound  its pretty aggravating if theres an issue can you please fix it,1love this app for one reason i can get all my account information without having to go online one of the best features is the automatic conversion of foreign transactions i know exactly how much i paid for something in us dollars in a few minutes after the transaction using the text alert feature  love knowing what is happening when its happening on my card,1i love the chase mobile app ive had some identity theft issues and when i get an alert before im even done swiping my card then i know i dont have to worry nobody can get away with anything because id know about it before they even left the store makes keeping track of whats going on so easy i just wish some of the specifics for transactions were more detailed  but thats a want not a need so its cool,1i have had many credit cards over the last  years but chase has always been the one that i put my large ticket items on they are very conscientious about maintaining my account and are always available to assist when things go wrong i have many accounts but this one is the best of the bunch and this application is intuitively easy to use and very functional  chase is the best,1i like the app as it shows the activity on my credit card but it looks like its too much detail that i dont care when i just want to quickly browse through them maybe you can just show the transaction title and the amount in one row and just group those rows by date that way it becomes really easy to look at them and if someone wants more details for a particular transaction then tap on it and it goes to a detailed view,1i like the app and it works well the only issue i have about it is that there is no setting to have it remember your password without the app actually remembering your password it actually encourages users to create a simple password they can remember luckily i have the roboform app and i am able to copy  my password from that app into the chase app the app should just create a simple  digit passcode you can remember on top of the option to have the app remember your password,1i have been a chase member for at least  years and in the past few years they have brought the greatest technology  i think this app is great and i am thinking of upgrading to an iphone so i can use the scan check feature i have an itouch now  you pay for these great services in higher fees and lower interest rates but in the end they have the widest selection of services for business people onthego,0while the app reads current balance the only reason i downloaded was to use the check deposit functions this does not work at all an utter waste of time for a start if you enter a check amount over the daily or other limit dont wait until the photos have been taken and analysis starts before telling me that its over the limit strike then allow me to zoom in on the check and use the flash three attempts on the one check  all sharp all within the bounds  and all failed to process makes me wonder if chase can get any technology right and whether its safe to stay banking there,1so first you have to click on password to enter your password then click done then click log on waste of keystrokes even apple accepts a completed password as log on commandsecond these push notifications  wow they look exactly like text messages and after youve read them the chase mobile keeps that little red circle with a number in it until you log on and go look at the alert youve just read that looks like a text message  it wont clear the unread push notification until youve gone all the way through to the alert againtheres no way you can get me to believe that the programmers are users  they couldnt engineer this app to be more onerousi also dont think any ios guys at apple bank with chase because theyd be tweaking this crap big time,1the app shows me how many alerts i have usually  or  but recently  for some unknown reason and when i log in i go to alert history but have no idea which account to look at for the alerts i have business accounts personalaccounts and joint accounts with my wife so its like hunting and pecking to find the alerts when you go to alert history it should take you to a list of your accounts with little red numbers next to them indicating how many alerts each one has please fix,1great app  deposit feature can be a little tricky but definitely works very coolone comment since last update alerts seem to be not working correctly  i get daily alerts now even though ive turned them all off  also alert badge on app comes back daily showing + alerts  might just be my accountps to os  beta testers agree with other reviewer  stop dinging this app for its performance on an unreleased os  go show off somewhere elsehow do i get to be a beta tester  ,1for all the people that cant sign in because it times out try a different wifi connection or use gg since ios  my s wont let me do a lot of things on wifi i can no longer sign into chase and also cant backup to icloud or send picture imessages using my g or a different wifi network fixes this anyways dont blame chase there is something wrong with ios  hope this helps,0i like the app until the recent update the old app with blue and white frames is simple and solid feeling my money is safe the current one has no frames and account names are thin and fable worse it shows word like transfer without frame or background i feel like using an online store which tries to rip me off not feeling like using a bank at first i was even wondering whether i ended up with a fraudulent appwhy does chase change a great app into a bad app why does chase even waste money to hire someone to change an app that had been working well and recognized by customers i simply dont understand the idiot manager who made the decision,1i have used banking apps for wells fargo and bank of america and chase mobile banking makes my life a whole lot easier all i have to do is just logon and i feel like im in control of my money from my phone with bank of america i had to go to the bank to make a transfer between accounts if it was higher than a certain amount chad mobile banking has really helped me out a lot especially in right situations,1this app sets the banking standard  it is so easy to check balances pay bills even deposit a check it pulls together in one place all chase accounts including checking savings and credit cards  my only very minor complaint is that it isnt easy to see all notifications in chronological order  instead they are by account  definitely a must have if you bank with chase,1i bank at bank of america and chase bank the bofa app is vastly superior the chase app is good for basic lookup but doesnt seem to allow you to see detailed history for other than current billing period the app locked up while setting alerts i accidentally hit the second line which allows you to switch between accounts when i want back to manage alerts it locked up with circular waiting symbol i suggest more detailed qa testing and user trails prior to your next release a buggy app reflects poorly on chase,1update i was able to deposit my check successfully this evening so i am revising my review it doesnt look like there has been an app update yet though so the problem may still existrecently the app has started crashing every time i take a photo of a check to deposit i cant figure out how to report problems with the mobile app so this is the best i can do to try to alert chase to the problem  please fix it,0too many updates knocks out previous versions making the app useless wont let you use the app without doing the update  they are supposed to be optional cant see transaction history just payment history what is the point of this app to make payments only very disappointedunless it changes i will just delete and use my storage on something useful all these checks and balances and i dont recognize this device crap and yall still got hacked clearly youre not doing something right hire better tech savvy people please,0great update but all updates to app are to slow reaching users touchid has been around for a long time yet just now added all while trade adopted it as soon as it was available same went for the iphone  n + ui update took  months for the update which is ridiculous while etrade was super quick im pretty sure chase has more resources available so they shouldnt be so far behind every major banking institution once again they r still behind this time with an apple watch app nowhere to be seen all while again etrade has one since pretty much day one on their app get it together and update in a timely manner chase,1great app use it everyday to check my debit card transactions and credit card transactions always updated and responsive but sometimes it lags a bit in processing through and as well as loading information redeem rewards needs to be worked on other than that everything is good just a few bugs that doesnt make it perfect so thats why i had to give it a  would be a  if it didnt lag,1i normally am very critical of reviews i am very impressed with the chase ap it is so user friendly and transferred money is available immediately providing you are in good standing with them obviously now the only issue i had was a lighting issue when trying to deposit a check and i would like the phone number of the branches themselves not just the  i prefer personal banking with the people at my branch,1i use several banking apps on my phone and i have to say that chase bank is by far the best online banking app out there  it works flawlessly every time loads up quickly the touch security feature is great and the ease of navigation is outstanding we actually moved to a state three years ago that doesnt have a chase bank and we just dont need a physical bank with this app at our fingertips love chase,1the part that frustrates me about this app is that i can log into the account using biometrics which is more secure but in order to make a payment i have to log in again with user name and password  this doesnt make any sense functionality of the app itself is fine i really dont like getting double messages every time i make a payment i get one confirmation then another from the secure message center saying the same thing i have  hates with chase so getting  emails every time i make a payment is quite annoying,1i find the chase app to be incredibly intuitive easy to use and quick i prefer to use the app for almost all banking needs that i can access through the app over using my laptop or desktop the deposit checks function is amazing and has a limited at least  of my trips to the bank thank you chase for getting it right,1the latest version works flawlessly and chase has come a long way in making this app easy and usable me personally i was not able to find any issues in this version when using it and i do use it on daily bases and everything works as it should comparing to other banks i can easily say at this point in time this is one of the best banking apps that chase has ever madethank you and keep up the good work,1at first i had a hard time reviewing balances and deposits now i can go straight to it with a click of a button the only thing the app should allow is the  consumer to set up their own pages without the extra steps for example when you open the app your balances should show up first without the use of the click of a button thanks for letting me voice a opinion,1finally after too much time we can now view checks but why no option to holdtouch and save to photo library  its a nuisance to have to take a screen shot then crop in photos  i hate bank of america but they have had check view and save to photo library since day one  come on chase get it together  maybe then ill raise rating to  or  stars  with the ability to view checks i raised from  stars to  but will go no higher until user friendly save check to photo library is available,1chase app has been improving but still has a ways to go especially on the credit card app features  you cant even redeem your bonus points with the app  they need to just look at discover card and copy what theyve done on the banking side the deposit online function works but usaas app performs this function way faster and much easier  they added the ability to view check scans which is awesome but you have to reenter your password  how dumb  please improve your competition is ahead,1i really like the chase app having the app at my fingertips is extremely helpful i often transfer money while im on the go and i even send payments and money to relatives on the go doing all of these things takes a few quick seconds and its so much easier ive never experienced any problems delays or issues with the app i appreciate the app a so definitely rely on it thanks chase,1chase bank has been a pleasure to deal with the seamless integration of mobile and online banking is nothing short of phenomenalthe few times i have had to call customer service were all  starsi can manage my money credit card and auto loan in the blink of an eye and transfer money to my children in secondsi could not rate this app and chase bank any less than the five starsthank you,1one of the best things about this app is that you can turn on an account preview feature where you dont need to log in to see your current account funds  simple setup and is not confusing when logged in you can transfer funds between accounts and even pay bills sometimes the check deposit feature doesnt work for me but sometimes it does,1wonderful app picture deposits are great one thing that needs to be fixed is touch id if my login session times out  the next time i open the app it doesnt ask for touch id as normal this requires me to enter the password manually or force close the app to get the touch id prompt a way to avoid this problem is to make sure and always logout when done before you timeout or force close the app after each use a little annoying,1very userfriendly and always works the feature i like best is that am able to see a preview of my account balances without having to login first until recently though theres been a chase freedom ad on top of the login area so i cant swipe to see my balance the way i used to as theres no room to put my finger anywhere on the bec of the ad it opens up another browser for the offer please fix this or make ad smaller if you must have the ad there,1it might not be the best banking app ever but for what i need it to do it works and im happy overall its easy to use and understand and i love that i can deposit checks on my phone rather than go to the atm i use the app to check my balance view cleared payments to make payments to outside vendors and to pay my chase credit card balance   i can even view and check my rewards balance,1this app has gone through different stages and right at this time i have absolutely no complaints had some problems with taking pictures of checks for deposit with an update which have been totally fixed all notifications are immediately sent for charges on my cardeverything is at your fingertips and easy to use i love the app and chase bank too good combo ,1this is the best app in my arsenal of applications i can check my balances deposit checks and see all of the activity within my account i find it to be the most important financial tool that i have ever had there are continuous updates the most recent being the ability to see the check itself ive been a chase customer for  years the convenience of this application is unprecedented,1the apps description of what it does is all accurate easy to use you can maneuver your money to and from any account transfers pay bills and accept money easily i havent had a problem yet and ive been using it for a few years now now if the bank itself could do something about the ridiculous fees that are attached to using chase bank that would be appreciated immensely,1ive been using this app for about  years and from my experience it is safe reliable and secure it is very user friendly and easy to navigate lots of useful features and functions gives a good snapshot of your account chase seems to be actively striving towards improving upon it by adding new featuresi only gave it  stars because doesnt give you as detailed a description of transactions as the desktop version  sometimes it lags,1i would like a search function for transactions for it to be complete but otherwise the features it has work well i have never had issues with check deposits and rarely have found it to be unavailable if it ever is unavailable it is actually a network issueno reception or wifi perhaps the message should be more clear but thats been my experience logging into the wifi fixes the issue right away,1love this app love that i can deposit checks from my kitchen table love that i can pay all my bills online in minutes love that i can easily transfer money between accounts as needed i like the alert functions that i set up for transactions that exceed a predetermined dollar amountthe app is easy intuitive and functions well lets me get in and out of my banking when i need to in mere minutes,1the app is flawless in every regard except for one major disadvantage all of the bill pay accounts need to be deleted and reentered on my mobile app otherwise the app informs me that i can go to my branch office to reenter my pay from sourcewhen the goal of my online banking is to save trouble and time though i am unclear of the need to go to a branch to verify what they already have on file  what worked for me in the past why cant the app work with mewith this inconvenience in mind i phoned chase asking if there was another option besides going to the branch waiting for a bank officer and verifying that my pay from source was the same as it ever was i was informed that i could make these changes on my desktop computerif this makes sense to you you might rate the app five stars it seems onerous to the customer so i give it a three out of five stars,1for a banking app this works well and lets me get done what i need to do however one annoyance is when the app presents a pop up message of its own would you like to rate this app for example and you have touch id login enabled after you dismiss the app pop up message touch id does not come up and the only way to get it to come up is to switch out of the app and back into it  if chase fixes this put a login with touch id link on the main page then that would bump this rating up another star,1the quickpay option allows me to receive child support payment for my  mo old baby in a matter of seconds instead of having to wait for a money order in the mail + days isnt ideal when needing to buy diapers and formula and both parties are happy knowing that it is noted in our bank statements so it is accounted for i can request the money title what it is for and even set the date that its due,1the app is fine for checking balances i dont do much else with it so cant comment on other aspects however i set a balance threshold alert and once i hit it it alerts me every single day so i either have to open the app to clear the notification or just ignore them and let them accumulate  this is perhaps more of a shortcoming with the website which is also sending the daily alerts  how about a weekly reminder after ive been notified once in a billing cycle,1this app is so easy to use plus it helps me to keep tract of all my transaction bank account and show me what i spent everyday so that i can restrain myself whenever i need you can do a lot of things on this app without going on the computer i would definitely suggest ppl to download it and start using it now dont wast time on computer anymore when you can directly do everything on your phone ,1terrific app for just about everything you need to do a few limitations but thats to be expected on a mobile app for instance you cant search previous wire transfers for recipient data theyre just not as functional as a full website that being said the latest version allows you to see checks in your account transaction view previous versions did not allow,1quick login immediate available balance is the first screen up easy access to options menu and handle business there is an alert section that allows you to set boundaries on whats supposed to be happening in your account your money is pretty safe it works very well for me be sure to take notice of maintenance warnings no access at all but those are usually in late hours,1i love the realtime deposit and charge and balance  no other banking has this awesome true app  i can keep track of my account if my wife goes on one of her nutty shopping spree or if some is illegally charging my account  like charging my account twice or even a dollar  that thats how many cashiers steal by over charging each customer a dollar or so over and at the end of the day gather a good chunk  thank you chase banking ,1i only use this app for my credit cards but it is wonderful it is so easy to switch from card to card it shows my rewards and when i want to make a payment it gives me multiple options some other apps just ask how much you want to pay without showing you the current balance or statement balance by far my favorite credit card app,1so i really like this app its very user friendly and its really easy to log in with your finger print i only have one little issue that i find really obnoxious the app asks you to rate it all the time and when it does you cant open the app with your thumb print because it doesnt give you the option so i either have to type in my long complicated password or force close and try again once this gets fixed i will definitely give it  stars thanks,1i was unable to change my password using the app over wifi i kept getting a message that said my new password did not meet criteria although it clearly met all criteria i also got a message that chase could not connect try again later with the help of online support i was able to change the password using my mobile device browser and finally log in with my new password using the app on my mobile device i was unable to change my password with the app,1nit picky reviews aside the chase app does everything its supposed to access to your account data and functionality allowing the display of your financial information and ability to pay your bills combined with nonapp email pushes of your statement theres nothing more to comment onall you naysayers grow up and appreciate the secure access that the chase developers give you,0this app is awful the worst part is the mobile deposits that never work right  most of the time it wont recognize a check at all and i versus you to go into the branch another time i got fined  because the app didnt recognize the full checking account number on the check how is that my fault it should have flagged it before it went through the bank of america app would check the checking account number before you even finished your deposit know that you made the correction there without getting fined later then the rep in the branch was very nasty about it i think i made a mistake by leaving bank of america,1im not seeing any of the issues other users seem to have i use the app daily with touchid to get a quick look at checking balance and bill pay the screens are simple and quick to read and in the rare instance i want to see the processed check image that works too i also used to do check deposits and was able to be in and out in less than  seconds basic banking needs but glad my app experience is positive,1i suppose the title describes my experience with this app it is perfect for customers who are always on the go and rely on their smartphones to submit their credit card payments or quickly deposit their checks my only piece of advice if you should deposit a check please make sure all the information on it is correct other than that i recommend this app,1good app can do my banking without going to the bank only thing quickdeposit needs to actually be quick just like going to the bank at the bank first  or  is available however i deposited a check for  and it wasnt available right away if you want people to use the application more and eatms then i suggest you make it the same as if going to deposit with a teller no surprising holds,1i love everything about this app except one thing hence the  stars im not able to clear alerts without logging in amp going under menu then alerts a few to many steps for my liking maybe if you could make a setting to allow alerted to pop up at login so we dont miss anything amp be able to be cleared at that point it worked kinda like that on my galaxy but when i switch to iphone in  i lost that please fix ,1ive been a chase customer since their takeover of wamu almost  years ago at the time i was skeptical but was won over quickly by their efficiency and quality customer service this app is yet another example of their excellent standards and classy attitude chase really listens to is customers and i think this app is a culmination of that it works its secure its easy to use its not buggy way to go chase,1i do not use it as much any longer since chase has removed my ability to transfer funds to individuals with an email address to anyone who does not have a chase account it is not nearly as convenient for me i personally deal with many people who do not have some depending on which state they live in minnesota for example where chase is not available,1this app is wonderful i enjoy banking at my finger tips   i like the fact that i can see all my accounts at a glance  look at previous statements  banking available anytime you need it  i use it to deposit checks from the comfort of my home  check and print bank statements among other things  recently i wanted to check a charge i made with my credit card to my dismay it only allowed the last three months that was not a good feeling  nonetheless i highly  recommend it,1easiest banking app and you can do any and everything you are able to do at the bank on the app technology of the app always improving and moving faster because i have  diff accounts and chase always has the new features first at no cost either i stay with chase bank although there is not one in my new state because of the online banking,1i primarily use my phone for banking and the wells fargo app didnt work most of the time and was very poorly designed i switched banks because i hated their app so much i also hated being pressured at every turn to open a credit account with themthis app is beautiful it has a simple uncluttered layout and has an impressive unique background depending on where i am in the country,0we use three banks for business wells fargo st bank and chase only chase is a pain to use  the app always says it doesnt recognize me phone that is totally bogus i use the same phone every time what chase wants is to use  forms of identification i have no problem with that but lets update the app please to be as accurate as you want me to be i am only depositing checks next is the actual picture taking the other banks app take a photo automatically chase will not having to always press a button slows the process down and yes all of this is better than having to drive to the bank but chase is behind in updating this app,0only shows me a few transactions at a time and they are in a big format that takes up a lot of screen space  also it offers me options to do wire transfers and a bunch of other things that my credit card account is not capable of they know what kind if account it is so why dont they hide those irrelevant options  besides that there are a lot of places in the ui that indicate that the developers didnt take much care to create a finished product  i wish they had because this would be really useful if they took a little more care  ahhh the pitfalls if trying to do anything new in a big company,1update at first i didnt have the deposit button on the app when it should have been there but now it is fixed and works great i am starting to use chase again even though the nearest bank or atm is about  miles from where i now live  i just hope they raise the limit on the deposit feature so i can switch back to using chase completelyother than that the app is ok with a decent ui but the help and faqs are a little too predominant,0the app hypes up the ability to take pictures of and deposit checks anywhere which works after the th time you are forced to retake the pictures  i just got married like their commercial and i have deposited over  checks so far using the app and not a  took less than  retakes and the most taking i kid you not  triesthe app is ambitious but it doesnt pull it off well enough if there is an update that makes the photo check depositing better ill increase the stars but for now im staying at ,1this app us great i cant remember the last time i actually stepped into a chase branch for any reason which is somewhat unfortunate because their employees always give me exceptional service i have all my accounts with chase and have access to all of them through this app keep up the great work chase i like how this app keeps you logged in in the app and doesnt send you to a web page on your browser boo to bofa on that one,1havent had a problem and ive had this app for  years now apparently iphones were the ones with the problem on the apps due to the new update apple had most phones had bugs to be fixed actually folks if you do your research chase is the leading bank when it comes to technology for example quick deposit quick pay instant issue debit cards etc,1all these people complain about having to put their user name in every time they login its you banking app people its you money do you want it to be stored think about it  i also have the pnc app and dont even have the save option that i know of and what is the big deal you have to type you user name in anyways  are you so lazy you cannot do it has technology brain washed us so much that we expect our phones to auto enter everything just put in you dmn user name yourself,1i do not know what i would do wo my chase app i am likely to want to pay bills or deposit a check in the middle of the night sure i could make a special trip the next day if someone took my iphone away and well i just love having the information when i want to spend and the capability when i need to deposit at my own crazy pace so far no probs and i have used it since i found out about it so about  years,1i would like to thank chase for this update as it finally allows me to transfer funds from my chase accounts to my other banks  the previous version did not recognize the other accounts that were added through chase online i like the sliding pane menubut please change one thingreplace the old dropdown menu button at the top left of the main screen to a logout button it really is pointless to have it slide the menu screen across with the iphone if you press the menu button and the screen slides you think you actually slid instead of tapall too common with touch screens furthermorethere should always be a logout button on the main screen for efficiency  having to slide over and scroll down is far less efficient overallgreat updatethank you ,0this app was fantastic until i was forced to update on nov  my deposit function doesnt work after i take the pic of the check the use button doesnt work i tried many times after  hrs i went to the bank and the bank manager couldnt get it to work we called the number on the app for help they couldnt help cause i couldnt remember my online banking password which i never had i was told no one else had a problem the upgrade was targeting customers with iphone s i have a s and i used this app yesterday without any problems pls fix it  ,0i love chase and have been a long time customer the ability to deposit a check using their mobile app is the primary reason i switched to them in the first place all of that changed tonight when i was forced to update the app  now like other users with the iphone s i cannot deposit checks i get as far as taking the picture but the app wont let me use or retake it worthless now i will have to wait until i can drive to a bank and deposit these checks the old fashioned way this is absolutely ridiculous that i cant even bank simply because chase forced an upgrade to a faulty app,0the whole reason i downloaded this app was because of the deposit feature where i could just deposit my checks via my phone seeing as i live in a rural area i cant easily get to a chase branch the deposit feature worked great until the new ios came out and then my iphone s wouldnt use the pictures of my checks i thought that this would be remedied when i upgraded to a s however i am now getting error messages when i try to submit the check this app is supposed to make banking easier at least thats what its advertised to do and its certainly not living up to my expectations,0i have an gb iphone  my phone still works so i have no plans to upgrade it while i can theoretically get ios  the space requirement would mean deleting the entire content of my phone to upgrade so i am stuck on  this was not a major issue until chase made this update  and higher and will not allow access to content on the prior version of the app chase please either allow ios  users to access the current version or allow users with a previous version to access the app,1i like the account preview function but i dont use it because it shows too much information let us decide which accounts are previewed and not default the setting to all or none touch id neededplease stop disabling older versions of the app so quickly forcing immediate updates some people have reasons for not updating to the latest version of apps and basically saying update to the latest version or go away is not customerfriendly,1i love this app its super easy to navigate through and find what youre looking for the app is really user friendly chase did a great job my only complaint is that i cant find a way to quickly access my account number or routing numbers on my usaa app i am able to access my account routing and card numbers quickly and easily that would be the only thing i would say could be improved upon other than that im loving the touch id log in ,1i use the chase app very frequently and it generally works great  makes deposits and money transfers very convenient  like others not sure why touch id was added since it doesnt provide additional functionality over that available by swiping  i wish the app would switch to landscape view on my ipad so i could more easily use it with the zagg wireless keyboard that i use all the time  other than that no complaints about this app,1not only is the there an advantage of accessing your account at any time from your mobile device but you can use your phone to send bank issued checks on your behalf at no cost i pay for everything that way now that requires a check rent utilities loans other bills and sometimes friends very useful bank app i dont even have a debit card and i dont need one with this,0i cant look at my balance half the time cant transfer half the time and the mobile notifications come days after the emails wont work with my fingerprint no matter how many times i delete and re download and set up yet again this app it consumes space on my phone which i would rather use for pictures of my dogs or even my food patches only seem to fix things for a couple if days and any time you want to let them know there is an issue w their app just to be helpful you have to call them and sit on hold for about  minutes im beginning to think that chase does not care about its customers,1this is a great app with lots of features it works great and i loved when they added the swipe for balances and the touch id but i dont understand why you have to login for certain featuresthe one thing i dont like since they added the swipetouch is that they made the keyboard smaller and the text smaller it used to have slightly bigger keys than the normal keyboard and now the text is just too small on things such as transfers,1its so easy to keep track of everything without going to a bank keeps your information secure if you try to log on in a different device not easy to be bypass nothing better than banking on the go  when u dont have time to actually stop to a bank i personally love it i have zero crashes and whatever is you need you can do through the app calling support finding a atm you name it,1i highly recommend this app i dont have a bank account with chase just a credit card but i love it i use it almost every day extremely user friendly and frequently updatedimproved the fingerprint sign in is the best one so far simple quick and easy to check the balance of my credit card or check rewards amount thanks chase for keeping the app well maintained,1my family continues to bank with chase because their technology far outweighs the competition the only complaint i have is the text alerts and app alerts to not align on time this can be confusing when trying to calculate an actual overdraft to a balance during business hours oftentimes transfers will not clear until the following day even from one checking account to another which i feel should occur in real time,1as an avid app user i felt compelled to comment on how amazingly accessible the app was to all the pertinent data i wanted to know about and needed moreover the coding behind this app must be optimized so well for it to flow so quickly from one section to the next if there is any delay it seems to simply be the ping back to the server for data i am highly pleased with this app and this alone as a techie makes me want to be a chase customer,1compared to their large bank peers this app is easily  starsin realistic practical terms its lacking a few thing and as updates have come through functionality has been removed like making car payments for example and i dont understand whybut on the whole  this is a solid showing if they could add all of the other features you get from the website this would absolutely be perfect in my book,1its very convenient to mobile bank and with this app it makes it much easier to do so from chase quickpay to the deposit feature its quick and easy to get into the app having your statements there too just puts the bank right there in your pocket either your laughing or your impressed either way if you have chase this simplifies life rather than your time   my two cents,0app has a nice clean interface but seriously how can you not do fingerprint for login on iphone  i now found another app that lets me do fingerprint login and retrieve my chase balances  would be great if this could be fixed  also the check scanning blows  it always says not clear so im never able to deposit checks  so i deposit the checks via bank of americas app instead which has no problems with the exact same pictures  would be great if you can fix thissearching for transactions is very clean and clear that part gets props,1for me it works great is very descriptive functional easy to use i make all my payments through my phone fast and easy i receive my notifications of due dates and transactions made in my account so i am always aware of what is going on in my accounts i have listed my checking a and all my credit cards so its easy and fast to move money from one account to another very happy with this app,1i thinks this app is great without any bugs that ive experienced very user friendly i just wish when looking at your recent activity you could see where that money was spent for example if i did a transfer of funds from someone elses account to mine  it will only say transfer and not from who it was from your contacts if you view it online you can see all the info little things like that would be nice to have change,1i have had no problems using this app i love that i dont have to use the safari browser to access the online banking system it is very easy to use and always works great when i need to login and manage my account ive never had any problemsissues or error messages when using this app i would recommend this app to everyone who has a chase account,1i have had chase as my primary bank for some time now and i really like it its very convenient to find one customer service is great and this app has helped me to manage my accounts easily the problem i have now is that the app crashes often and doesnt want to even load seems like majority of the time it can be very troublesome when having to pay a lot of things and wanting to know exactly where my money is going,1it really is amazing considering all the things you can do with this one app i can manage all our personal and business accounts with one login which is a huge plus the one thing i would change would be removing the requirement to enter your password to do certain functions after having already logged in using one touch while i do appreciate the extra security i think a fingerprint login should be good enough for any function,1love the touch screen to start the app is very easy to use  i have to move money between business and personal accounts and am away from my office and home a lot and the app makes it very convenient to do it on time from anywhere its easier to use than other banks ive been with and that is one of the main reasons we have several accounts with chase thanks for the good work,1this is a very good app does everything i need it to do have never experienced any bugs or other problems use it regularly to transfer money to other chase accounts as well as setting up automatic payments or even  time payments never had any problems with check deposit feature either highly recommend if you have an account with chase,1one of the rare apps id say is pretty much perfect   the ability to view and manage my checking savings credit card is great   quick pay and depositing checks is awesome i deposit chase bank checks to my chase account so the ability to have those funds instantly available would be nice but waiting a couple extra days as opposed to going in to the bank is no biggy,1honestly i left chase for a few weeks and changed over to another bank but honestly i strongly disliked the way the their app functioned and just the way it looks was not so appealing and i simply came back with chase because of how much easier it is check balances and transactions and all that good stuff im not leaving chase again lol the simplicity to this app makes all the difference in the world,1i personally think this app is great i can quickly check my accounts transfer money use quick pay and deposit checks with my camera the only problem i have with it is that the touch id option doesnt always pop up whenever i open the app most of the time i have to close the app and reopen it just to use touch id and sometimes that doesnt even work besides this problem i think the app is great,1i love this app it has made my life easier being able to view my transaction at anytime it allows me to see if my checks are automatically applied on time and the automatic deductions have taken place it allows me to balance my checkbook expeditiouslythanks to everyone involved in designing this process i know it isnt a small task and that a lot goes into making this happen and it is greatly much appreciated nmj,1all apps should work this as well as this one does your bank should work for you as well as chase works for me  i have become quite dependent upon my phone and this app is a big part of why i have set the threshold for notification to  this means that i usually get a text notification before i get out the door of the store the app tells me every morning what my balance is yup i need more stars for this app,1have been using chase mobile for over a year without any real problems but have been hoping the newest update would include allowing it to work in landscape orientation for ipad disappointed that this version still requires me to turn the pad to portrait position to use easilylater addendum still easy to use but still no landscape orientation option available,1ive had accounts at other banks and was worried about switching to a big bank but this app has made my life much easier i see my balances get notifications so i know when a distributor has been paid make payments either through quick pay or online and pay my credit card bill i know where my money is all the time and love the finger touch entry,1this app is great for viewing your balance and making payments which are the most important functions i rate it at  stars because while it performs the basics really well i wish it had the features my other banking apps have  namely touch sign on ios i have gotten so used to this fast amp easy way to log in that its now feeling laborious to have to type in my whole password every time but on a whole its a solid app that gets the job done never crashes and is very responsive eg has great performance speed,1never had an issue since chase took over washington mutual loved wamu chase came in amp kept the best wamu employees ive opened multiple accounts for my kids amp me always a pleasant professional experience in person by phone or a chat room online consistently chase employees illustrate knowledge acrosstheboard amp either have answers or will find them in a matter of minutes,1i have different apps for different financial institutions and this is on my top  only thing i would change is being able to make a payment without actually entering the password if somebody has my fingerprint to go to the app they would have an access to my password im sure one you have the fingerprint it is an unnecessary step to make a payment in my opinion other than that i love the app,1im a hairstylist and i receive a ton of checks it used to be such a pain to write up my slip and make a special trip to the bank i love this ease of banking the site is reliable never have had an issue with crashes or errors im sold and will not be going anywhere else simply because of the mobile deposit feature truly wish i would have opened an account sooner thanks,1you got it i cant live without it but seems i have to every time i use the app it says i cant when i asked a customer service rep about this she said no big deal just remove and download again so thats what i do every time i want to see my balance delete and download the app every time i want to pay my cc bill i delete and download the app frustrating to say the least so now i only use the app once a month to pay my bill and yes i had to delete and download it his month too,1i am traveling overseas and this app really does not help  i got this card because of no international charges  but if i want to add a country i am needing to travel to or contact someone at chase to do that this app does not help  i change sim card a lot depending on the region i am in but there is no function that allows me to im or message an agent for help  it is basic and will help you see your bill and charges  but for travelers i would look into different cardsbanks who understand international needs and not just us based customers,1i love this app especially for depositing checks  unfortunately they deny you access at the strangest times  today i tried to deposit several checks at about  pm and access was denied  it would let me log in and see accounts i just couldnt deposit a check  they should do their maintenance off hours or just state that the site is brokenthis has happened to me several times this year in what i would call normal business hours,1this app is very user friendly and functions well it provides a quick snapshot view of your accounts and i love the mobile deposit feature this allows me to conveniently deposit checks in a timely manner without having to add an atm run to my busy schedule ive had very few issues with the camera feature and those issues occurred several months of not a year ago,1never fear when you need to know you balance or just need to transfer a few dollars this app is perfect i have not been in a chase for over two yrs all my balance ie loans checking savings credit card are in one place i love seeing charges post instantly and being able to deposit third party checks there is no other bank in my area that gives me the features i get on this app,1ive used this app for years now and have always found it to be easy to use as well as having all the tools i need for personal banking personal banking has evolved from the days of simply writing checks with this app i can schedule payments transfer money to other accounts both within chase and outside accounts  even to individual people  stars,1i love this app i can check my bank statement at any given time  i will be notice when i am all under my designated balance  i will be notified if there is any fraudulent purchasing on my account  i can transfer money from one account to another i can wire money anywhere this is just a great app at my fingertips that i can used when i need too  i can deposit a check without going into the bank,1i really appreciate the simplicity of this app my favorite part is when i have to pay my balance i dont need to memorize the amount i need to type in i can just tap the option to pay balance exact amount listed usually i forget whats after the decimal and need to toggle back to the previous screen or which is so annoying and such a time waster,1does everything i need to and i like that now i dont have to open the messages in the browser the interface is clear and easy to understand the one thing i had a problem with was travel notifications i forgot to add while traveling it was very hard for me to get any straight information about whether i needed to warn chase before i was there so i didnt lose my funds,1the chase app continues to deliver and grow its a great complement to their inbranch and online services we moved hundreds of miles from our nearest branch and being able to deposit checks and the k daily limit from anywhere has been essential to keeping our accounts with chase quickpay and bill pay are also handy the interface is streamlined and attractive im very pleased with the chase app,1we love this last update the log on touch button its very smooth its awesome only two bad thing one after touch id used why ask to type why do cant used id again i total odontological thing   next you cant do rewards point transferred my accounts only computer but by any starbucks card two bad things but cant live like this no ok  star if clean one bad thing go back  stars o one more thing security best,1i opened a chase account specifically because of their mobile app i was previously with another bank that had a very poor mobile app well chase is certainly on top of technology and i cannot complain one ounce the app has an efficient user friendly ui and plenty of features i have been happy with chase ever since i switched mostly due to the app and atms keep up the great work,0i was a loyal amex user and love their app which is what i compare the chase app to i dont like the navigation which is clunky and  of the time i have to go to the desktop version which is crazy i cant set up an initial cc payment with my bank on the app why i got an email about signing up for tsa pre check and logged in yet it didnt take me to the page i spent  minutes looking for it wow the statement itself is difficult to view although accessing it is easy perhaps the banking features are more robust but i am underwhelmed by what they offer for the cc,1something invalidates passwords even strong ones every few weeks and a change is necessary this is really annoying  ok getting people to regularly change passwords is good but for goodness sake run crack against it and nag me but dont just invalidate them a  character pw with symbols numbers and mixed case is not likely to be a problem the ui could use a refresh compared to amex or wells fargo its pretty tired it works but not exactly straightforward the functionality is there its just hard to find,1people who have probs with this app should try to reinstall it or something i have used it for a few years now and it always works well i do check deposits using the camera and transfer between accounts even from other banks with no problems this app makes mylife a lot easier and lets me send time on other things rather than heading to the bank thanks ,1this app is great for me it allows me to always keep track of what my activities are its a great way for me to see the monthly payouts and where my money is going i like the alerts and that i can transfer from account to account the one thing is that my finger prints sign in does not always come up automatically like it did before this last update other than that again its very handy for me,1this version of the chase app is great very easy to navigate pay your credit cards check balances your bonus rewards everything thanks for improving this app and making it a lot better the concern i have which is the touch id feature is not coming up when i try to log in even though i have it on also every time there is an update it requires you to put the password and when i do enter it it says too many log in attempts you need to change it this is getting tiresome,1love being able to make deposits online instead of going to the bank for one check    so easy  used to not scan checks properly and i put together it was when people had signatures that extended far beyond the lines but theyve improved and now it reads all checks awesome to do things real quick cant believe all the negative reviews its an app  not full online banking,1i love this app from signing in with my thumb to transferring money to fam so easily with chase quick pay i am able to manage my checking and savings account  and pay my credit cards so easily i am never late with it any of my payments because it is so easy to manage and stay on top of them with this app i love the color blues scheme and i really use this app on a daily basis,1i find the app satisfies most of my banking needs the deposit function almost completely negates my need to actually go to the bank it is vitally important that i can monitor all my accounts and it enables me to  me to maintain appropriate balances in a variety of connected accounts without fear of overdrafts or other charges  i can even monitor a healthy investment account remotely as i travel frequently this is critical,1this app is really easy to use and it has all the options that you would expect from a major company like chase with this app i have access to all my accounts balances reward points options to redeem reward points and many other features i dont have to visit their website anymore in order to do all these things and that is awesome,1ive only ever used desktop banking services  if i wasnt going into the bank or through the drive through my frame of reference may be skewed as this is the only banking app ive ever used however the experience hasnt been lacking i only lament the future of those who work at branches that is the ones who havent already been squeezed out by the mechanized tellers with all that we now can quickly do from wherever theres a signal well,0i heard about this app on a local technology radio show they raved about the quick deposit featuresounded great to me so i downloaded the app only to discover the quick deposit has a  per day and  per month limit what the heck i dont even get checks that small so as far as i see it its more or less useless unless you are a teenager with a lawn mowing business or have some kind of pitifully unprofitable retail establishmentim sure ill find some use for it at some point and its free so i cant  really complain i was just really disappointed,1using it on iphone gs works perfectly every time it would be nice to deposit more than the current max amount but i also understand the day and age were in of scammers and fraudulent activities maybe they will allow for specific account holders that regularly deposit large amounts and have a good standing history to deposit more money at a time andor per month,1i have multiple accounts and they list on the first screen with my name with no way to distinguish until i click into them banker nicknamed my accounts and still didnt change on that screen  seems like a huge usability issue also minor bugthe touch down inside a button for an account displays the wrong highlight image its upside down  when its not the first account havent tried the quick deposit yet that many complain about most other functions work fine for me,1have used this app to check daily balances deposit checks and pay bills but i find that i still need to use the full website to manage the details of my account for me this is acceptable for a mobile app my one complaint is the alert counter it does not reset correctly i can view my alerts and they are cleared for that one day the next day the alert counter is back with all alerts counted  not just the new unviewed alerts,1great app for accessing my accounts on the gopush notifications are nice when you go to alerts its hard to see what the most recent alert was which often makes the feature more trouble then its worth my dream feature from this app and from chase online would be the ability to categorize line items from my accounts and view graphs by categories overall awesome app,0i had this app since early  and never had a single problem i could read over my statements and pay my credit card bill incredibly easy then after an update i suddenly couldnt figure out how to make a payment they changed the process completely and i still cant figure it out its not the end of the world since i can still make payments online but wasnt that the purpose of creating the app i am so disappointment and wished i wouldnt have updated the app hopefully they read these comments and change it back,0this app is frustrating i hate that it doesnt have the transactions that i make show up on the app right away it shows up days later so i think i have more money than i really do and then i end up with a negative balance and an overdraft fee even though i have overdraft protection the whole point of this app to avoid having to go to the bank but the bank is the only place where i can see what my real balance is the alerts it sends are way off even if i dont waste any money in a week itll still always show me that i have more money than what i really do have,1this app has made my life so much easier i wish it had check imaging that is the only thing lacking however i am able to keep up with my account very easily and i love the check deposit feature it saves having to make a special trip for one or two small deposits i also really like the alert feature because it lets me know when my direct deposit paycheck or tax refund has hit,1i love how everything is always up to date and theres always a chance for me to be able to see what i and my wife have bought over the period of the day month three months also be able to have money in my account and transfer it to pay off one or two of my credit cards all within three minutes saves a lot of time i am a huge fan of this chase app,1ill admit the new look took some getting used to but i like it the start up screen with a picture of places near where i live was also a nice touch unless it was by pure coincidence also like the app acknowledging the time of day when you open it with a good morning or good evening other than that the app pretty much works as well as it always has which for me has been great keep up the good work,1love everything about this app but would like it if my alerts would show which of my accounts is having an issue i have to guess be is the app isnt intended for multiple checking and savings accounts in alerts when an alert shows up you have to follow the check marks then guess other than that i love that i can pay all my bills anytime i please super fast always reliable,0after taking a picture of the paper check to be deposited the use button does not function the picture cannot be submitted i called last week about the problem they said it would be fixed by nov  didnt happen i called last night and they wasted  minutes on the phone troubleshooting a know issue today i downloaded the ios  update and the chase mobile update the mobile deposit function still does not work  this was a great app two updates ago now it is not im using an iphone s,1ive been a chase client for ages and love this app i have a mac and lately have had a difficult time trying to log on with safari i use my mobile app more often since this mac problem started ive called apple they say its chase that has the problem  i called chase and they tell me safari is the problem its sad such a big bank cant figure this out oh well at least i have the mobile app,1i use this app every day sometimes several times a day its so easy to check your balance pay your bills and transfer money having teenagers i have their accounts linked to mine so if they need money and im traveling for business sending them money is as easy as a click of a button and the best part is it goes in instantly if you dont have it then get it makes life much more simple,1this is a very good app that provides very useful and essential information the new update allows for the user to log in via fingerprint touch id which saves a lot of time and is in my opinion more secure than entering your password for the world to see  all my chase accounts are listed in one easy to see view  overall this is a fantastic app im glad to see that chase put in the investment into their app,1i love the chase mobile app its very efficient and quick i know its also a secure way to check my bank account without having to worry about people getting into it i also love the quick view even if people saw this they would still need to gain access into my actual account i also love that chase has partnered with apple with the passbook live finding stores that use this ,0chasei am disappointed with your choice to incorporate your support for the homosexual agenda into your business marketing strategy the social and political realms of our society should not be crossed over by proclaiming support for or against as an opinion by an economical entity i dont care if a man wants to marry his dog or a rock for that matter whats absurd is when my bank tells me  they support this through their marquees in branches and on the screens of the atm machines do you want to tell me who to vote for what religion to believe where to live what to eat what car to drive etc then dont tell me youre in favor of any other dynamic of life other than my finances,1if you have an account with chase you should be using this app  its more convenient than the website and you can deposit checks using your phone camera ive deposited many checks and it works great  saving me trips to the atm except for large checksnow with touch id support i dont have to enter my long and complicated password each timemy current limit is  per check,1this app is part of my essential toolkit for me the best part is i get an at a glance overview of all my accounts checking savings and credit card  because of the overall integration i find that my primary credit card has become chase freedom the checking part of the app is five star but the credit card portion is not nearly on par with other companies however it doesnt limit my basic necessities of viewing monitoring and paying,1i love this app my only criticism is with the alerts in order to read and clear them one must find them first  theres no indication which account generated the alert requiring a search  a filter beyond just the amount would help so its not necessary to locate them each time i receive my regular direct deposit paycheck vs any other deposit over   that said the overall convenience is great,1i am an it tech ibm systems engineer with  years of professional experience this app has added features across the last several years that make it more and more useful the latest enhancement of displaying the image of cleared checks is rapidly advancing this app to a profession support status also i have many credit cards and that app has far and away the best implementation of alerts of any app out there,1i love the app overall the only thing i absolutely hate is the alert feature as it does not tell you which account the sleet is on and you gave to check them all if you have more than one account i love the quick deposit feature that allows you to take a snapshot of a check back and front for immediate deposit  that alone saves me time and gas again overall it is a great app,1this app is easy to use and helps me keep track of my money a couple of times because i could see my balances so easily i was able to alert chase about someone stealing my account number and saving a lot of headache i also really like the bill paying featurethe only thing i would like they used to show your credit card balance and due date at a glance and now i have to navigate all the way to the statement which is a pain,1this is a great app i use it exclusively compared to the full chase website the only reason i must give it  stars is due to the fact you cant set the app to send push notifications this is a feature i would like to have set for quickpay direct deposits etc otherwise this is an excellent app and with the past few updates over the years it has become much better still waiting for push notifications,1what is there to say i find it convenient quick helpful its just another reason why i tell my friends when they are deciding to switch to another bank go with chase i dog sit on the side amp two of my customers love the quick pay option to pay me its fast easy amp i dont have to go out of my way to get paid the alerts are handy amp the app is effortless take your time getting used to this app it will be easy amp like breathing banking how it should be,1the best part of this app is chase quick pay its so convenient especially when a night at a restaurant with a large party the bill splitting is nullified most of my friends use chase so it makes it that much better my only complaint is that the alerts are great its just sometimes to view them i find that it either disappears of it takes too long to open i recommend chase and quick pay all the time,1does everything that i need it to do i love the instant notifications when i make a purchase that exceeds the amount i preset bill pay is awesome i can set payments in advance and set up automatic payments with ease  love the fact that i can access my balance just by swiping left without having to log on comes in handy when standing in line to make a purchase  all in all very satisfied,1intuitive quick and easy to use app  nearly as customer friendly as the branches themselves ive banned with  other large institutions in the last and never had as great of an experience as with chase this app makes it easy to manage and track finances pay bills deposit checks and stay up to date with account balances in real time  in my book,1the chase app definitely reflects the ideals of the business in general it never disappoints and if it plans to disappoint it lets you know days in advance that the app will be down its generally quick and easy and makes life so much easier a great way to truly have your money in a dependable cloud online you can only log on using lte not wifi but other than that its as easy as can be love you chase,1i can easily manage nearly all my banking quite easily all functions are intuitive and direct only downside applies equally to full sitecredit card and loan accounts can only be viewed by the login of the primary name so to manage a full family of accounts i have to use two different log ins secure messages are a bit cumbersome but i rarely need to access them anyway,1this app is the entire bank save the cash transactions but if you absolutely must deposit or withdraw cash the app will help you find your nearest atm or branch i really wish i could use all the features of the app with my touchid even if it meant i had to input the id many times i like having the extra security for the transfers quick pay ext but i would like if i could use my touchid for these security checks,1i have been with this bank since before it was chase so ive seen the services grow  they were very observant and found things in my account that should not have been there and notified me immediately then assisted me with removing them with no charges to me  plus the representatives were very friendly and understanding great bank not leaving them any time soon and still recommending them to friends,1i use my chase ap every day so great when i get a notification every time my card is used instantly all i had to do was set up my preferences and can get notified by email text or  alerts to my phone what ever i think is important if i need to transfer money its a snap do not need to go to a bank teller any more so fast and convenient i never have to worry about theft i know exactly when card is used,1im sure there are features that this could be included to make this app even better but it works for me i use this app several times a week if not every day and it handles all of my banking needs i love the quick pay function of the app that allows me to transfer money instantlyi am able to take pictures of checks for instant deposits without any issues i like the convenience of swiping one way to see the balances on all of my accounts and then swiping the other way to log into my accounti have several chase accounts and i can jump backandforth or transfer money between them without any problemsi also happen to have bank of america and wells fargo accounts this app is better than both of theirs like i said in the title it works for me,1the app has a beautiful interface with very smooth animations and all the same functionality as their websitenow beautifulness alone wont do much but the app has all of the necessary features available  bank accounts checksavings credit cards push notification alerts online payments transfers and quickpaygood job chase ,1i love this app it pretty much has the same functionality as the chase website used on a computer  the app is very convenient to use when i dont have access to a computer  i like that i can pay a bill or transfer funds immediately if i need to  i also like the quick pay function which allows transferred funds to be immediately available  i think this app is great,1i live by this app everyday to check my balances make quick deposits instant transfers and with a teenaged daughter quickpay has become a regular i love the touch id function for extra security it has stopped working every once in a while and ive had to go back in to to settings to turn it back on but other than that i cannot complain great app chase i would recommend it to everyone i know,1i saw a couple reviews that gave  or  stars i didnt read them all the way through because they seemed to be by people who use this app for business purposes i just use it for depositing checks from time to time the only problem ive had is with my phone getting service in the foothills as long as i can connect it does what is supposed to and is easy and convenient,1ive been a chase customer for almost  years and more than likely will not bank anywhere else because of the convenience with their banking from the many locations no matter where you go in the us almost to the customer service and of course the ease of online banking whod wanna bank with anyone else keep up the great work with the app and everything else chase and youll have customers for a lifetime,1ive had this app for years and it continues to get better ive a couple other bank account apps that cant even come close to this my favorite feature is getting a notification immediately when my card is swiped not a few mins later its instant also the chase quick pay allows me to send my family and friends money within seconds love it,1this chase app for mobile banking is so easy to use that even i could figure it out for myself and i have some mental problems and usually need help for anything as advanced as making a mobile check deposit well i was already in the app when i decided to try i just followed the steps filled in the numbers took the pictures hit submit and voila i did itall by myself,0bizarrely and shockingly outdated app in that touch id is not available or supported  otherwise it is only an extremely basic app which does seem to function properly  the only actions one can perform are view ones balance and transactions and schedule payments  there is no way to even view ones total reward miles for example  it does finally show how many miles one earns per transaction gee    frequent flyer mile duh but otherwise the app simply gives a terse message about needing to go to the card partners website to check ones rewards  weak,1ive been using this app since i got iphone  plus two months ago and have been thoroughly impressed  the app is very stable and i can now access my chase accounts online without having to log into pc make deposits and payment comfortably while lying on bed after work  i highly recommend everyone who has an account with chase to give it a try,1this app makes it easy to pay my credit card on time any time  and updates are real improvements im glad they no longer use fingerprint access  it wasnt helpful because i still had to put in my password later recently they eliminated the messages that would come every time i made a payment those were unnecessary and annoying  the app keeps improving,1one of my favorite apps in terms of design and ease of use love the touch id feature because i hate putting in my password the ability to get free music is cool but would be better if you got to select what you wanted i think all features should be available because that is the point of going on the app to avoid the browser or desktop site overall the app is very efficient and nice looking,1ive been using chase banking app since  and its been great overall the gui is great and user friendly it easy to navigate around i use the app to transfer funds from one account to another send money to friends w quick pay the only time ive experienced problems with the app is when there are large updates going on but chase notify you before it happens so your prepared or make the adjustments that you need,0how does this not have finger print scan support its  wake up the check deposits never work and even the process in the b of a app is way easier also i can lock and unlock my debit care directly from my b of a app with out ever having to go out of my way to call or be put on hold all of the people who are giving this app  stars only use one bank they like it because they have nothing to compare it to the ease of use with the b of a app is seriously be enough for me to switch banks entirely its frustrating this half baked app makes me feel like chase really does not care about their customers,1i think this interface works a lot better and just a lot smoother than other bank apps chase has continually made improvementsespecially with depositing checks i used to have trouble depositing checks because of recognition errors but they seem to have fixed it now it takes me approximately  seconds to do all of that and be on the go,1very easy to use my checking and savings accounts are easy to access and all my transactions are shown i can do deposits through the app just take a photo of checks and many other good features i also like that i can use my finger print to open the app very easy to use and has all the features i need and more excellent app if you bank with chase this is a must to have app,1obviously if you bank with chase this is just the app you get so its not as though there are options but the app works surprisingly well with that in mind its easily navigable makes checking account balances and transferring money super easy on the go and the mobile deposit for checks works great from what i hear of other banking apps this one is superior and im grateful,1this works great  you could bank anywhere just like the site differrent package more compact straight to the point you can search transactions and even pay bills a must have for chase customersnice update its better and easy to pay bills great job i never had a problem getting recognized through the app if you ever had to reset a password through the pc its basically similar,0ok first off this app is just like any bank app ive used this app is very handy just like all bank apps i bank heavily with chase and would like to know my status at demand whether im in vegas out of the country or in vacation the app seems to be in maintenance for a few days and its killin me cant transfer funds and cant check my status maybe coincidence but i check my bank of america account and they seem to be much more reliable i have never seen them in maintenance so i use them when chase fails overall this app is good but needs to be operational ay demand then ill bump up my rating,1fix the alert icon app was fine beforemy review hasnt changed other than the annoying red alert that is now always present  the only thing holding it back is that alerts are buried and difficult to find the quick deposit feature is very convenient and works well all other features work well too  pay bills transfer etc work the same as chase online if familiar with chase online using this app is easy to get acquainted with,1when i first tried it a few days ago it was really slow but that must have been the banks fault not the app today it is working as intended and even let me deposit a check by taking a picture first time doing that and it was really easy i  really needed to use this feature because im now living some  miles from the nearest chase bank and dont even have an atm nearby,1perhaps the problem for some users is not the app itself but instead the devices through which they are using it   it works just fine for me thru wifi on my ipod touch  apple devices do what they do better than all others and that very issue is what seperates them  from other less reliable mobile platforms such as samsungs and motorolas,0ive been using this app forever and in the past have found it both easy and convenient it has allowed me to track balances on my familys multiple checking and savings accounts and to watch credit card transactions one of my favorite features has been the ability to deposit checks but something happened i can no longer do anything as i cant even get past the sign in page chase its certainly not the interest rate you are paying me that makes me bank with you and its not too difficult to check out the app support of your competition i suggest you get this fixed pdq,0this app started sending push notifications with debit and balance information to my phone there was no way to turn it off that means if someone found my phone even locked they would find out periodically exactly how much money i had in the bank i cant believe that such app behavior complies with banking privacy regulations even its certainly dangerous to the user unbelievable beyond that horrible feature take a moment to think how not just dangerous but potentially embarrassing it could be its a mediocre app at best youd think with millions of dollars to build this they would do a competent job but sadly its beyond poor  its a disaster,1i never take the time to rate aps but i was so surprised by all the negative ratings over trivial things like an old look that i just had to defend this wonderful useful ap useful convenient and reliable i rarely have any problems with it at all and i use it on a daily basis for checking balances transferring between bussiness and personal checking and savings accounts and depositing checks thank you chase,0this morning as soon as i logged into the chase app i received an email stating that my account alert settings had changed and to call chase if i didnt change them i checked in the app and all my alerts had been turned off i called chase and they told me they hadnt sent me an email and that all my alerts were still on they were unaware of any app problems i got off the phone and there was a badge on the app icon stating that i had  unread alerts needless to say the app has been deleted and password changedtwo stars is for the great functionality to date,1this app allows me to keep track of my spending and as a college studentthats essential the only flaw i can speak of pertaining to this app is the sequencing of spending if i spend a certain amount as well as receive deposits within a certain time period ie  hrs by the end of the day the app will rearrange the sequence of spending and earning and it will show my spending and deposits out of the order in which it occurred,1i find the app easy to use and nicely designed however i got an email that chase had sent me a message in the secure message center and there is just no way to access thatupdate the latest version responded to my complaint above so i awarded another star it always takes at least three tries to deposit a check regardless the amount if light and clarity of the scan of the check fix that and its a fivestar app,1i prefer the app over the website often because of the ease of the transfer features the notifications are helpful and it is easy to navigate the app my one downside is that you have to go into each of your accounts in notifications to see which account had the most recent notification posted otherwise its great,1i have multiple banks credit union big bank local bank of these chase is by far and away the best of the three the online check deposit the ability to pay bills and send money when friends or family need it basically in this day and age the more things i can accomplish without actually having to go to the physical location the better and chase meets the standard,0i recently moved my banking back to chase mainly because i can use applepay the first  times i used the mobile app to deposit a check it worked the last  times ive tried i get a message telling me the transaction cant be completed at this time making it necessary to go to the bank to make the deposit my husband has also had trouble he used the app to deposit a check went through all the steps and received confirmation that it had been accepted it never showed up in the account and when he went into the bank he was told the deposit was never made i now regret giving chase a second chance,1i think this app is absolutely amazing it makes sending money easy and helps me keep track of my accounts my only thing is the update where we can sign in with our fingerprint i thought that was a great idea but it is pretty annoying when i sign in with that but then need to provide my password if i want to do anything within the app that is my only complaint but other than that i love it,1easy to use simple and very easy to manage and access all my accounts credit card and loans i see last statements transactions and even future due dates the ability to hit the help button it call chase and have a live person on the other end within two minutes is irreplaceable   thank you chase for truly building a functional app and support structure,1you can view pending purchases instantly its easy to pay your account with the app and in quick preview it gives your new available credit as soon as you make a purchase its really nicewhat i would like to see is a  or  digit pin to access the app instead of having to enter in a long password in each time,1with this app i am able to view all of my transactions for any chase accounts i have i am also able to transfer money to or from a checking account to a savings account and vise verse and not have to wait for any clearance my family and friends that also have a chase account can easily transfer money to each other without having to wait for approval,0i used this app for years even on my old barely working s until a few months ago for the last two months on a brand new s with reliable lte or wifi i cant do anything most of the time i cant log in when i do get in i cant use quickpay or deposit checks thats really all i needive deleted and reinstalled multiple times ive downloaded every update nothing has changed an app that helps me check my balance  of the time is a waste of space on my phone and resources for chase they wouldnt need to keep building new locations of the app worked and you could actually deposit checks,1so i work at a bank myself and so i guess i have high expectationsim young my phone is my life and i am lazy so i need a little more fat people friendly features on this app likeaccount and routing number availability other than on my statement because my account was so new and my statement hadnt generated yettravel plan notifications directly from the app i hope its not to much to ask since my other bank offers itthats all carry on with your day ,1i absolutely love chase in all aspects i have many accounts with them my private client banker is the absolute best and helps me in every way possible he is always there to answer all my questions even if it does not pertain to his area of expertise this app works excellent i have had no problems with it i recommend chase to all my friends and family i would never use any other bank i am a longtime member of chase bank,1i should start by saying that i use touch id to access the app however once i am inside the app when i select to view my statement or choose to schedule a payment i am asked for a password i am not sure why and it makes no sense a great analogy would be someone inside your home you request a key if theyre already inside your home the key would be irrelevant other than that annoying issue the app does everything i need,1i moved to rural east texas from houston about six years ago and never changed my bank i love being able to deposit checks and pay bills with my phone this has made my life so much easier i only wish i could deposit the money orders my houston tenant pays me with using my phone i have to mail those in thats the only thing i cant do with either my phone or my laptop,1works great i like that you can view checks now and the availability of transferring money between chase accounts its user friendly and visually appealing i also like that the home page pictures change depending on where you are my only complaint is that i wish the amount of money in my checking account was always higher but thats not really chases problem,1been a chase customer for years through the merging of washington mutual i use this app daily and really appreciate the simplicity and ease of navigation in and out even with security measures which i appreciate as well the app is not as robust as the actual website understandably so for more granular account specifics that should be done from the main website and not accessible from an app,1this app is convenient has saved me a lot of trips to the bank and the bank itself has never given me an issue they have even waved a couple fees when ive made a mistake the only issue ive had with the app is that in a moment where i really needed to transfer money for a personal emergency it had a blackout date im not sure what that was about but it had only happened that one time,1i absolutely love chase quickpay and quickdeposit best thing about the app its relatively easy to check your balance move funds and otherwise manage your account i honestly love how you can deposit checks through taking a picture i only wish i could check my balance without logging in and that i could   freeze my account if i lost or misplaced my card its great that they wouldnt hold me responsible for unauthorized payments should someone steal my card,1the app does what most crecit card apps do the fingerprint and wuick pay and check deposit nothing out of the ordinary what i wished this app had is the ability to click each transaction like how discover cc app does and shows where it was used and under what category it is put in ex restaurants travel etc chase should also give free fici credit score too there are other credit cards that give this feature that has no annual fee but my chase credit card has annual fee but doent have this feature,1i like the features it has now im glad chase got on board with the touch id but since they did it makes the quick review of accounts a little more difficult you have to cancel the touch id then swipe right since touch id is prompted every time you go into the app and its so easy to do it makes the quick review irrelevant to those who have the touch id capability thats the only thing i have to give as feedback everything else is great,1i like the app but with the addition of touch id i was happy that i no longer had to put in my password but in order to pay my credit card bill i have to manually type in a password after just logging in with touch id seems counterintuitive i use a password manager so i have to close out of the app or copy my password before opening the chase app in order to input my password to pay a bill can you please fix this or add a share sheet where i can use password from within the app thanks,1i can do most of my daily banking needs with this so its mostly goodsome issues that leave me unable to give the app five stars are that it often leaves notifications sitting around instead of clearing them it doesnt make it easy to see my account numbers when i need them requires logging in via a web browser instead and many of the notifications arent actually useful at all,1this is an excellent app work so much better than  other bank apps if you want to keep track of all accounts its the one to have set up of notification for use of account is great for monitoring account activity low balance over draft etc one feature that would be very nice would be the ability to hide accounts that you dont wish to be displayed,1i have been using this app since opening my account in  and have found it extremely convenient and easy to use i do all my banking remote deposits bill paying transfers etc through it this latest update allowing the viewing of checks deposited corrects the one shortcoming i had an issue with now its perfect nice work i wish other banking apps were as polished,1the app refresh recently was a nice touch and shows theyre still always working on making it better the simplicity of the app is great lets you quickly get what you want to find out about while also offering the more detailed views to track spending and deposit checks with the cameraoverall very happy with the app thank you,1app works well easy to navigate this is true however im tired of signing in w my fingerprint which was a big reason for buying my latest phone only to have the prompt tell me i need to put in my password to pay my bill thats just beyond silly who has my fingerprint besides me shouldnt that be better than a password i also have to agree w the others reporting how difficult it is to create a password that chase amp so many others is happy with its my password amp you want me to remember it so let me choose one i can remember,1sleek design i use it often for transferring money from my savings to my checking for big purchases and to check my balance on the go depositing check through the app is a life saving feature that i use all the time for work quick pay is even better as it is the primary way my mom amp sister send me money for school overall amazing product and app,1overall i find the app functions pretty well i recently moved and havent had the chance to find my local chase this app has definitely made things easy with the ability to log in anywhere i can check my balance make payments transfer money and deposit checks i can even see my recent charge history this has definitely made my life easier,0i also bank with several other companies and the chase app is middle of the road it is really annoying that they have touch id but then you still have to enter your password to do most anything in the app finding a location is limited to a list without a map or option to filter to only branches or atms they use a very uninspired or well organized navigation and just throw everything into a hamburger menu they have a good base to build on but have some major competition that is out performing them when it comes to mobile apps,1love how easy to use this app is i hate when others just bloat up the software in an attempt to make them look contemporary my only real issue is having to input my password after logging in with touchid to make payments or even view secure messages not sure why the pw is even required since i just logged in but it should at least let me use touchid my password is long and complex so its a pain to grab it and enter just use touchid,1great banking app although not as powerful as the desktop version a few improvements if chase is readingthe touch login window annoyingly pops up while trying to enter the password dont force that windowimprove the alert massaging feature for those with multiple account i have  accounts and the app makes you search each account for an alert message,1this app runs really well no bugs so far and it works smoothly for exactly what i need it for i recently moved and the nearest chase is  minutes away so depositing checks can be a pain but the feature on the app is really simple and easy to use and works fast i can also pay bills and transfer money  pretty much anything i can do on chase online but via the app,1overall i have been very satisfied with this app i have only had a problem depositing a check through the app one time i do wish there was a higher deposit limit for mobile deposits for awhile my husband was getting paid weekly with no direct deposit and its inconvenient to not be able to mobile deposit every week also for some reason the touch id is no longer available and i miss it,1i use it constantly to deposit checks make quickpay and check balance it is easy to use and saves me lots of time than going to bank locations the minor improvement i would suggest to do is the photo taken for deposit the final image is not what you see in the blue box it is big and has more which may include things that you dont want without knowing that,1chase visa is my major credit card for every day use i find that its speedy posting of all charges and the alerts comes in extremely handy when purchasing items and services using apple pay walmart pay sams scan amp go and various other online services this app give me total and immediate access to my account information and i value of that highly ,1it works  of the time for me i wish the bill pay feature available both in the app as well as on the full site better represented pending payments up front when selecting an account i would also like changing the payment amount when there is an already scheduled payment to be easier presently so far as i know you have to cancel an existing payment and schedule a new one with the adjusted amount overall an adequate app that does the basics well enough,1chase is on top of their game when it comes to this app whenever you use your chase card let it be credit  or debit in anyway shape or form within  to  seconds tops it notifies your phone or sends notification to this app on any device you have it installed unfortunately i have been a victim of identity theft in the past however when it comes to chase i never have to worry about it i ever again,0i used to be able to see my credit card charges  now it it goes one day past the billing cycle it shows only full page copies of the bill it no longer shows my recent activity not my recent charges or payments  the pages are impossible to go over on a mobile app  so basically chde screwed over their mobile users because we can no longer access our recent information  so this month i am blind paying my credit card bills because there is no way to see what was spent where  ive caught bogus activity before now i have no idea if theres cc fraud on my acct or not lousy update,1i use the chase app almost every day to i check balance and review charges  also love the mobile check deposit and bill pay  chase is very prompt regarding monitoring accounts for transactions that seem fraudulent and out of sync with your normal buying habits  i love banking with chase  use the pay bill and deposit features the most and find them so convenient  thanks chase great app,1my only complaint is the lag on updates when i make a transaction on my debit card sometimes the amount doesnt immediately update that can become a huge problem because it makes me think i have more money than i actually do although that is a huge issue i really like this app its simple easy to use and easy to navigate through i wish i could give this app  stars but i would appreciate more timely statements,1ive had this app for over  years and it keeps improving it always updates me if any of my accounts go below a certain number it also notified me when theyre was so fraudulent activity occurring i love the chase deposit future as i can snap a picture and deposit it automatically and i love being able to transfer funds on my phone its a great app for a wonderful bank,1very easy to use their online bill pay options have changed my life doesnt get any better than this my mortgage even ended up being through chase so i can pay every bill from their app digitally cash any check and even transfer money from my account to other accounts very reliable they give fair warning if they are ever down for updates,1with the last updates this app can be the best mobile bank i used raipfaisen doiche bank app and a lot functions i wish they had all features i was dreamed only chase hasi dont know event when can be better or what options can be neededim using app instead of full web site version as app is always with you and has all the functions as web site has,1this app is simple to use allows instant transfers online bill pay information on just about everything chase offers and never crashes i love that it now takes me straight to the account home page after transfers now so i can see my new balances without the extra click on my part i wouldnt have expected such great technology from a bank impressive,1i love this app because it saves me time and money by not having to run to the bank to deposit checks now if it could spit cash out for withdrawls it would be perfect the only thing i wish i could see with this app is the image of the check i deposited or wrote out then i could do everything on my phone alas i have to use my computer to balance my books,1agree with other users this app constantly says too many login attempts practically every single time i use it forcing me to change my password constantly  plus the touch id work for me about  updates ago and since then it hasnt  when i do get into the app after i have once again updated my password i do find it fairly easy to navigate   please please please fix the password issue so this app can be as convenient as it should be for your customers,1as someone who does a lot of traveling it is fantastic to have a dependable app so i always have access to my accounts chase continues to sore above the rest with their innovation  it is so user friendly that even my  year old grandmother knows how to use it and loves the bill pay feature and the ability to deposit checks without having to drive to the bank,1my husband and i use this app sometime daily we also have kids in the military and im attached to the accounts which allows us to set up or pay bills for them depositing checks and transferring money between accounts is so simple easy pay for bills is simple to set up and quick easy way to track what due and whenbottom line knowing my balance on demand is the ultimate best,1love the app its definitely the best one chase has had over the past + years i do not have any credit cards with chase though amp that seems to be causing problems with others as far as pending withdrawalspaymentsdeductions i treat them as paid amp never depend on that money being available ive never have a problem since then,1as far as banking apps go this one works great i use it every day to check my balances and transfer money across my accounts keeps me from being overdrawn in any one of my accounts as debit card charges show up immediately as a pending charge i have it set up to text me if any account is about to be overdrawn gives me ample time to move funds to cover the pending transactions,1its nice to be able to switch funds from accounts or pay your credit card when you need to i wish the checking account had a quick button underneath like my other listed accounts to transfer money currently it only has a button to make a payment  i use this app almost daily and would definitely recommend,1if you were deciding which bigger bank or any bank to use this app will help you decide im spoiled with it and rarely go in i used to go into make deposits regularly but now only do it  out of  times i assumed all banks had useful apps until i installed the dopey one from wells fargo all you can do with theirs is look at your money i truly appreciate the thought that went into the chase app,0when youre able to log in the app does everything you expect a banking app to do however frequently ill open the app and the option to log in w touch id is disabled this always a sign of trouble ahead the app will never accept the correct password and eventually locks you out then ill call customer service to get it unlocked and ill have to change my password again the annoying thing is according to customer service its a known issue but it hasnt been fixed in months why bother having the app,1when i open the app i want it to ask for my thumbprint  password is long and complicated and i dont want to type it in every single time so i have my preference set to thumbprint log on periodically it asks me to rate the app and if i say ask me later it wont ask for my thumbprint again i have to get in and out so im finally rating this app so it will stop asking me to rate this appupdated dropped a star i am sick and tired of having to close out of the app because it keeps asking me to rate it ive rated it,1generally love the convenience and features have one issue that i will have to call on one payee says it cant make the payment because i have it tied to an incorrect account but when i go to the website it is properly linked to my checking would like to be able to fix this on my ipad as well as set up recurring payments no can do  and like many others i dislike the menu driven phone system enough that i put it off,1its great works well  of the time sometimes it doesnt show correct balance or takes too long to update balance also would like to be able to do everything i can do via computer on the app those of us that dont have a computer rely on this and when we need to change things need to find someone elses computer to use please update,1much much better than my previous institution i was banking with neighbors federal credit union this banking app is far superior to what i had i receive alerts now that tell me everything i need to know about my account pending charges are not held from my balance for days and weeks like my previous account either i really love this system should have switched to chase a long time ago,1convenient and valuable with many time saving features but in the last month the app has been inaccessible for several long durations apparently for maintenance causing no small amount of stress also navigating the alerts part is somewhat strange why must one click on savings in order to see alerts related to checking also i love being able to use the app to deposit checks this is a remarkable time saver,1we use chase for our business banking and another bank for our personal both have online apps that i use a lot but the feature i use the most is remote deposit i can deposit up to  daily to my personal bank not that i have anything close to that yet can only deposit  monthly on chase business thats beyond crazy and if my personal bank did business banking wed switch in a heart beat please please please up the deposit limits,0deposited a check the auto capturing of account number missed the last digit of the account number on the check but the app allows you to enter the number manually so i did that after a few days i see that the check bounced the reason the app added the last missing digit from the account number as the first digit this is despite me entering the account number correctly chase refunded the fee but i dont really trust the check deposit portion of the app now and this is really all i was using the app for,1so the  cap on monthly deposits makes the deposit feature useless to many people also i have deposited multiple checks thru the app and every single time i get an error on the first attempt saying amount entered is different than amount on the check and it always has  for the amount it thinks is on the check it works the second try every time would be  stars  if there was no or much larger monthlyper check limit and fixed buggy amount reading,1i loved this app until recently the last  days it tells me its unable to connect to chase whenever i click on my checking to see the details of my account seeing the total  amount is great buy how am i supposed to monitor my account if i cant see the transactions fix please between the app not working and the chase website being unavailable so often im beginning to wonder about chase on a positive note i have deposited  checks with with the appiphone and it worked perfectly every time,0got this app and almost got an account at chase what a mistake that would have been i found out just in time that if any financial institution that chase now owns such as washington mutual once claimed that you owed them money which they never collected that chase may simply rip the money right out of your account with them for it without ever having to go to court and prove anythingill stick with my financial institution which accepts deposits online and requires the checks to be mailed to them the money becomes available the very next business day which is much sooner than the availability of funds that chase offers,1it wont deposit checks with the instructions  given if the check is larger than a  small personal check aftermany tries figured out the secret forget about keeping entire check in the frame or all being readable  make sure the routing number account number at the bottom is clear and the amount secondarily   it really doesnt matter if the name or other stuff is   ive been depositing just paying attention to the bottom line and no problems,1ive been using this app for several weeks and i absolutely love it i love that i dont have to drive  minutes every week to deposit checks and the bill payment is even easier and quicker to use than the online version chase was the first bank in my area to have envelopefree atm deposits and now this they are on the leading edge of banking technology making my life a little easier thank you,1i can only give  stars everything works fine except for the fact that my quickdeposit doesnt even show up like the pictures above of the app itself the deposit button doesnt even show up on my screen ive tried deleting it and reinstalling it but it still wont show up i have the iphone  with the latest ios version which is the  i believe if any of you can help me out please reply this feature would be really useful for me thank you and you all enjoy your holidays,1i like this app but it is frustrating when i try to find a branch or atm closest to me when i downloaded the app i was in an area with no chase in  miles radius im not in that area anymore and when i ask the app to find a branch for me it doesnt even use the gps to find where i am it just repeats there is no chase in this area i even checked by turning my gps off and the app didnt even notice it its so frustrating when you assume there is no chase around but you pass by one by chance,1this app is great for the convenience of monitoring account balances and depositing checks remotely such a time saverthe one aspect of the app that really bothers me though is the location of the alerts center i shouldnt have to dig through two menus to get to my alerts why cant they be on the home screen youd think they would be one of the first things the customer should see id love to see this change in future updates,1i have had a few different major banks and chase by far is the bestboth technology and keeping their customers first this app works amazing all apps are having to change because of apple and the new ios not because the company wants your money get your facts straight if youre having problems call online banking theyll walk you through everything thanks chase for a great app,0i used the app for  months with no issues  about  weeks back it just stopped working  when i launch the app it never even gets to the login page  just crashes  i tried called customer service not much help  they told me to reinstall the app which i had already tried and to reboot phone already tried and to try installing from my pc and also making sure ios was up to date  i tried all of that and it still doesnt work ill just delete it for now and wait until they come out with the next update bummer,1an excellent app that i use all the time does everything i need a mobile banking app to do but i keep getting were temporarily unable to connect to chase please try again later thanks for your patience when im connected to my phone carriers network yet when i connect to wifi it goes right through with no problem please fix this aside from this minor bug i would recommend this app to friends and family thank you,1i have many bank apps and this is by far the best fastest and easiest way to connect w my finances i do not understand all the negative reviews especially the one where the user said they would switch banks over an app i can pay my chase credit card bills easily send payments with quick pay and view how many savings withdraws ive done in the month without issue great way to monitor finances,1ive been using this app for  years now gs  s s i can pay all my bills in one place deposit checks and see the damage ive done to my accounts all in one place it is so much more efficient opposed to monthly statements and bank runs literally running by the time i leave workpaying bills has never been easier and i dont stress trying to memorize usernames and passwords from separate accountsthe one thing i would change is the interface its pretty dated and boring but thats just me being a visual person i have other suggestions but im not getting paid for this sorry jp morgan and friends those of you reviewers having issues with checks should carefully follow the instructions especially if you have an older model iphone camera quality could be the issue,0i used to deposit checks via the app on the ipad rather than iphone because photos came out better  now the ipad app will not allow you to take photos of the checks  pop up keeps coming up telling user to change ipad to horizontal view  message wont go away and there is no way to take photo  wont let you see check and click camera icon to take photo  icon not there just horizontal message  with iphone app the photos of check are never centered properly and need to take  or more photos to be able to deposit,1the security features of this app being able to dictate text alerts on activity is reason alone for this app  i often get a text alerting me to a purchase before i get to my car when leaving a store  i am confident this will alert me to fraudulent purchases this app along with chases outstanding customer service are an outstanding combination for credit card security and confidence,1app has great security and shows a lot of helpful information about your accounts with chase  check deposit feature works great and saved me a lot of trips to the local branch  it should be said though that the mobile app cannot do everything some online features need to be accessed from a traditional computer  but app has several convenient on the go features,1if you try to cash a check with a bad cellularwifi connection it isnt going to be able to handle sending your information with bit encryption wonderful app have never had a problem cashing my checks when on wifi no chase banks around me for + miles so this is absolutely necessary always instantly has my balance after a purchase and usually makes my funds from a check available after  hours,1well i absolutely love chase and this app i have recently encounter a problem since the update though i am now unable to deposit checks from my phone this was a nice feature and the camera is showing straight black i have tried to restart my phone and have also done a hard reset but still nothing please fix this issue other than that i love this app and love the new swipe to see your account balance awesome,1logging on via touch id is a very nice feature only thing i would like to see is the ability to delete online messages via the app i have to login through the full website to delete my secure messages surely theres a way to make that work via the appeverything else is looking good and it appears the developers are listening to what the users want,1i use couple different financial institutions but chase and discovernot sorry about the shameless plugin are the once which set the bar when it comes to mobile banking very very high use it every day and it works the way you would expect for it to work to make your life easy and it does it without a doubt their developers team constantly works on staying ahead of the curve great job amp thank you chase,0my excitement for the chase finally implementing touchid quick vanished when i went to make a payment and it prompted me for a password what is the point of this feature if you still need to enter a password it seems so contradictory basically the equivalent to going to make a purchase with the apple pay feature holding the phone up to make a payment then as confirmation the vendor asks you to swipe your credit card as well great you just added an absolutely unnecessary step please remove this and i will update this review till then touchid will remain disabled,1i have been using this for about  years and its great ive only ever banked with chase because of how amazing they are and their customer service i love being able to just check the app for all of my banking needs they recently added the ability to use your fingerprint scan to sign in also i love it just that much more because of it wonderful wonderful app good job chase,0this would be a great app except i only use it to deposit a check about once a month it works about  of the time i enter the info take the pics and submit it says it cant complete the transaction but no reason why gives me a button to try again but erases everything i did theres nowhere to report problems but if i call they just suggest my phone settings or internet connection is a problem and thats not it it would be a huge timesaver to me if it worked hopefully someone will read this and test it more than once,1reading some of the other reviews and i completely understand we all have our different preferences my preference is a easy safe amp secure app my favorite is the account preview feature it allows you to view your balance with just a scroll to the left without needing to sign in sometimes i need to just check if my pay check was deposited yet or maybe check if a personal check cleared thanks jp morgan ,1i use chase with a savings and checking account my direct deposits from work and the va come in to my checking my phone notifies me every time any activity of a certain prespecified type occurs on either account its nice to see that activity and it has worked every time an activity met a condition i set on my account balance below x direct deposit of x etc i am able to transfer between accounts and the touch id is a godsend all in all pretty well built app,1i used to hate chase but they are getting better and better the app is super easy to use i use it multiple times every day i have a simple checking and savings account so the problem with alerts that everyone is having doesnt bother me  if i have an alert or notification i usually already know why plus the notification to my iphone app tells me,1i switched to chase for two reasons years ago customer service current technology ive always been impressed with the bank and this app however there are a couple of minor improvements that would make things a  star i consistently get logged out of touch id and cant use it to log in to the app the messaging system sometimes works and sometimes doesnt minor stuff in an otherwise leading class app and bank,1if youre a chase bank customer this is a must have app as others suggested take the time to learn this app and it will make paying bills transferring money and keeping track of all your transactions a breeze with this app i never have to worry if im near an open branch or mailing anything out on time plus chase is always updating the app and adding new features this is truly the best app on my phone,1this app is extremely useful as well as easy to use being able to pay credit card bills and transfer money between accounts in no time at all takes stress out of needing to get to a branch office during business hours viewing checking  account statements can also be very beneficial to keep up with bills paid or items purchased all in all a great app,1ive used chases mobile app since its inception and have found it a very useful way to access my account pay bills transfer money and make deposits from home or anywhere i happen to be  saves me phone calls and trips to the bank is easy to use and intuitive to navigate  highly recommend this app for all mobile banking customers,1this banking app was the first with mobile check deposits persontoperson quick pay and to this day is the quickest easiest to use and most functional feature rich of the banking apps ive extensively used the regions and bank of america apps and have limited experience with the capitol one banking app i prefer the chase app over all of the above mentioned banking apps my ,1i am a happy customer yet somehow this app keeps getting better and better all my banking needs right in the palm of my hand everything from quick pay to depositing checks right from the comfort of my home i dont have anything bad to say it really does exceed expectations  hey maybe we need an app support person to talk to for our banking needs like an in app tellercustomer care agent there you go,1i never have had an issue with this app its always worked phenomenal ive been with chase for years now and would probably never switch just because of the convenience of the bank theres a lot of locations the online app works great and i can even deposit checks with it i dont even have any suggestions on how they could make it any better five stars,1pretty much i like this app a lot he touch id is handywhen it works mostly use it for checking balances and making deposits i can appreciate that it requires me to reenter my password when i want to transfer funds even if ive already signed in but app then claims it doesnt recognize my phone and crashes after i enter password boo fix that and ill give it  stars,1i love this app ive always banked with chase and using this app makes it so much easier to stay on top of my funds chase quickpay is a great tool to transfer money right into my account i love that the money is available right away ive never had any problems with the app i totally would recommend it to anyone who banks with chase definitely beats logging online or calling them,1i have been with chase bank for years this app has made banking so much easier easy to read layout and easy to use functionality like transfers has made my banking life much easier the screens are easy to navigate and clear to read if you are a member of chase with one or even multiple accounts  this app will help you keep tabs on your balances i highly recommend this app,1as many reviewers have said this is a good app that lets you use the basic features of your accounts efficiently it could be a great app with a few simple fixes such as allowing touch id to function as the password for the entire site and by making a few of the screens more intuitive its easy to get lost in the app while hunting for a function especially if you have more than one account with them,1its not that bad but it has some errors that needs to look testing a app it should be uncovered for tester it has numerical problems with input other languages its showed a problem that none of the banker will be able to tell what generating this error so i found it when i was using other languages any way thanks for a great way to start also it should display every click in opening page,1this works for all practical purposes but if you compare to the american express payment app for example it lacks a lot of the same features recently added the ability to login with fingerprint which is nice although annoying to have to type in your password again to pay why not just use fingerprint to set payment overall okay could be better i guess id rate  for overall does the job without my needing to login online though which is a big plus,1all  of my visa credit cards are managed by chase i love the instant access to info being able to pay my bills and love the notifications warning though i used a simple password and all three of my card numbers were stolen cant be sure it was the app but no issues since i made my password more complicated because of the notifications i knew immediately about the first unauthorized purchase and chase was awesome about it no worries,1i use this app to manage my credit card account  i do not currently hold any other accounts with chase but my experience so far makes me open to using additional chase products and services in the future  this app easily allows me to see pending and posted charges make payments right from my phone and track my rewards balance  ive been pleased,1overall its a great convenience and ive used may times to make deposits but when an chase update is needed  can the message come up when the app is first opened currently you have to go thru the sign on process in order to be told you cannot proceed any further until the app is updated  really why make us go thru the password process when it doesnt take it anyway  simplify by having the message pop up immediately,1i have been baking with chase for the last  years initially i was a couple of minutes walk from the nearest chase branch but i still enjoyed using the app  for the last  years i live an hour and a half from the nearest branch i still bank with chase and i have no complains the app is great never crashed and things are so intuitive and easy to work with well done chase,1this is a great app very functional enabling all kinds of transactions right from my iphone or ipad including depositing checks simply by taking photos of the front and back of the checks however i dont understand why there is a limit to the amount one may deposit electronically in a one month period otherwise the app allows me to do all  my banking right from my iphone so i give it  stars,1we have watched the app improve over the last few years and are pleased they are listening to clients wish there was no limit on online deposits once established businesses should have the ability to post as many checks as they received via the app to their accounts we saw a glitch a couple weeks ago and for a brief time it showed a deposit limit of k that would have made our year,1i havent had an account with chase for a while only about seven months now but part of the reason i have the account was because the app and all the stuff that it has on it i personally love it it almost always works for me every once in a while theres a glitch or whatever but thats probably the whole system  i love it great app great way to keep track your money easily transferring money backandforth between accounts,1my partner and i have benefited from this app immensely ive been underemployed ever since we moved for his job and he constantly has to send me money as i tend to do all of the shopping etc gone are the days of an accidental overdraft i get a notification when my account balance is low or overdrawn and then he can transfer money to me now i dont even have to go into the app to accept the money,1i can see how individuals give it the full five stars for their personal banking experience but chase needs to start thinking of doing a bizonly app that allows for easy transfers ach and intl wiring the notification settings should be rethought and brought to the front of the app its too cumbersome and takes too many unnecessary clicks to get to and are mostly after the fact messages anyway rest is just fine once you learn to quickly navigate between personal and business banking,1this app is helpful and very userfriendly functions are located logically for easy access items like preview and the running balance on each transaction make online banking quick and efficient and the layout and fonts used are visually appealing this is a well thoughtout app however that popup ad for the costco credit card or whatever a while back was frustrating and superannoying,1it makes banking easier and it makes it very simple and handy to use any time night or day when you are wanting to check your balance in your accounts it also is very handy for when you are at a check out and it comes back your card has been declined you can transfer funds from one account to another while waiting in line,1ive been with chase since they bought out washington mutual at first i was hesitant but i have grown very proud of the bank customer service and their app is second to none i also bank with pnc and i usaa for the last four years ive lived in two different states of which neither has had a chase branch montana and pennsylvania ive still been able to do my banking with ease and mostly on the app thanks chase,0first of all no touch id for iphone app not sure what is their concern with not implementing biometric security feature entering password could be the worst thing for app security it could be easily stolen and all you money gone the last app doesnt work well with depositing checks anymore it used to work very well not it tells me there was not enough lightwhat im doing this during day when sun was shining through windows slowly this chase app is degrading and becoming useless please keep up with time and technology usability for account summary and transfers are still good star,1it is so good to be able to schedule bills transfer money and verify balances from a device when away from home i like the functionality and found it easy to navigate from the start my  year old motherin law adapted to it and loves it she does all her banking from her lounge chair old people and young love to watch their money this app makes it very easy to manage banking at chase,1i like that the chase bank app has so many features available its far better than huntingtons which only contains a few basic features the only thing i would fix is the touch id on the log in screen it works great except if another dialogue pops up first ex youve been logged out  session timed out then it never gives you a touch id option and you have to manually type the password which can be kind of annoying,1i love the chase app it suits all my needs i mainly use it for the quick pay function to send out money i also like that you can now see deposit statements on the app instead of only being able to see them on the computer like before and for an extra cute topping the app pulls up different background screens based on where you are love it,1its a very convenient and secure app sometimes i forget to log out but with the chase security level i always have the peace of mind that no unauthorized access to my account would be allowed also the alerts on the limits i set and on suspicious activities are fantastic its so easy n convenient that i check my balances every few hours excellent job chase its extremely helpful to be able to navigate between accounts so easily and conveniently,1love being able to send money to my son in college from my smart phone very useful to pay back friends and relatives the downside is in requesting others to pay you using quick pay i sent a request to  people all bright and experienced wit using apps and nobody was successful in sending me money they all had to use paper checks none were happy with chase after this bad experience,0is anyone else having problems with the app signing you out and then when you try to sign back in it tells you you have attempted to login too many times even though it was the first time you tried  this has happened to me several times the same password works online but not on the app i have reset my password several times and i know i am using the correct one each time but i reset it anyway just so i can log in last time i even set up the fingerprint reader for the app was able to use the app once before it logged me out again i am so fed up with this app that i will be deleting it,1its fast easy and useful for when you need to check your account make payments and make changes to any of your accounts it lets you deposit checks send quickpay to anyone which is really awesome and sends you notifications for alerts that you can customize it does have a couple bugs here and there and the updates mess with it sometimes but overall its a great app super useful,1a must for everyone can keep an eye on all aspects and transactions of your accounts within the palm of your hand very user friendly can make ccard payments thru the app transfer money in between accounts with chase quick pay i can send money to someone straight from account to account even if they have a different financial institution like my daughter away for college all around great app,1great easy to access i like it this is the greatest thing that chase did for us customers every single day i feel like chase bank is with me everywhere i am i can deposit my checks by phone and that save me a time for standing online i basically does everything with this app and the only time i go to chase bank is that i want to cash  my checks other than that the app is awesome ,1recent updates have made this app much more functional and friendly  i can send money to friends and easily deposit checks no matter where i happen to be  if i forget i can pay my credit card balance at the last minute  this is what i need from this app while i am spending several months on temporary assignment in a location without physical branches,1like this app for the most part however chase just did some sort of update to their system that seems to have messed up the online deposit when i do a mobile deposit now a different routing number and account number show up during the verification stage it will only allow me to change the account number i havent actually gone forward with a deposit since this because i dont trust that its correct and will go to my bank account,1ive been using the app for years its only gotten better i do most of my banking from my phone pay bills transfers and i can even see my mortgage ira and investment account i love the instant transfers and quick pay i also manage the kids custodial accounts  i still go to the bank in person for some deposits i like to keep the relationship with the people that work there,1 stars chases app is very useful and i use transfers quick pays and check depositing often they are easy enough to do and help you track your money well unfortunately the fingerprint id glitches about every weektwo weeks thereby forcing you to have to create a new password to access your account its very annoying the app also sends you to chases website for certain functions which in  should be able to be completed on the app,0this app gets slower and clunkier for the past month or so in order to deposit more than one check i have to log out and back in each time stupid and half the time it freezes right at the end of a deposit in addition many redundant steps in the deposit process i dont need to be told each time to take a picture of the back of the check then have to clear that message screen also why do we need to enter a period it should be just the numbers because the period will be in the same position each time please fix this,1job well done very useful features very easy to use i can get a ton of banking now done just from my phone saves me hours of having to go to a bank and wait in line features like quick pay bill pay and being able to see live updates of transactions is just fantastic keep up the cool features dont be afraid to continuously get more innovative,1this is a solid banking app like the touch option to log in and the ability to access all chase accounts quickly it has occasional issues with connection and ability to complete a task or transaction but the full site has similar issues i use a different financial app to understand the daily transactions within my finances so only use this one a couple times a month but its perfectly serviceable,0i have had to reset my password four times in the last two months because of too many attempts to login due to using the fingerprint reader and one incorrect passwordyou cant just force someone to reset their password because their finger or home button is dirty you stupid bank fix this issue i am sick of resetting my password because your app is too poorly written to realize a fingerprint login isnt the same as an incorrect password entry or develop a peek functionality like the superior bank barclay then users could check their balance without even needing to login,0chase has an amazing app but it is constantly down for maintenance they also struggle to incorporate touch id i had it set up and touch id failures caused me to have to reset my password seven times due to multiple failed login attempts but the only failure was the touch id function chases systems seem to collapse every week company wide ive had issues logging in getting accurate balances and even making transfers between my own accounts for a large bank and a self proclaimed leader in the industry chase cant seem to figure out how to operate pretty sad because like i said ifwhen the app works its pretty great,0i bank with chase i am pleased that they wrote an ap to take advantage of the iphone i will use this ap its free it works having typed that i am very disappointed at the quality of this ap chase youre a leading bank and should have an ap that raises the standard of financial aps for the mobile banking market chase mobile is slow and counter intuitive it does what it needs to do but feels like an afterthought the interface  aesthetic and functionality  is poor at best get it if you bank with chase but be prepared to be disappointed,1overall the app is very nice but im frustrated that the quick deposit is for business accounts only in my type of business i rarely have a check that is less than the  daily limit id use it a lot more if i could deposit check into my personal accounts sadly ill probably never be able to use this cool feature  if they fixed this id easily give the app  or  more stars,1i have two account logins  one with a personal account and one that has both personal and business  i do not see the deposit choice when logged into personal login only  when i log into the profile that has both types of account i see the deposit option and it only allows me to deposit into business account  great potential needs personal account support  fyi the usaa app requires a credit card etc probably for their protection against fraud,1this app is great as far as bank apps go viewing activity paying bills all really easy but the quick deposit doesnt work anymore the first time i used it it worked perfectly later that weekend it said that feature was unavailable monday rolled around and it was available but keeps giving me errors saying it cant read the amount or the routing number did they rework the app to only work with the iphone camera,1this app is great for checking balances paying bill  basic online banking needs  the check deposit feature is great but the dailymonthly limits are too low  nothing worse than a great feature you cant use  i get the risk but have some other process to allow good banking clients to deposit a  check hold the money for all i care  just save me the trip to the bankatm,1i like this app and use it fairly often if i could change just one thing it would be the screenshots that represent the program in the itunes app store above the second screenshot shows a person with three bank accounts  two checking and one savings the checking accounts each have around  in them and the savings account has  my problem is that person should really put more into savings,1i have gone from major bank to major bank and i have to say chase has the upperhand when it comes to online and mobile banking yes they may have higher qualifications for their checking accounts but the fact that their online and mobile banking is so easy and convenient has won my business at chase so many products and services to choose from love it good job chase,1i really like being able to view my balances deposits etc but the alerts are never visible on this app and its really annoying if you have signed up for push alerts you see them on your phone then when you log into chase you see a red dot on alerts indicating you have an alert but when i go to that screen there is only one message visible the same one from months ago  i think this is a glitch that needs to be fixed iphone s user,1i love the app i jut wish there was a way to hide the message of an alert i dont like that if my phone is sitting on a table and chase pops up an alert saying a check for a certain amount hit amp anyone can see it i know i could just turn them off but sometimes i need to know right away when something hits  i wish you could hide the preview like with texts and it would just show up as char alert or something like that that would be great,1this app has always done everything its supposed to do for metransfer balances deposit checks quick pay etc love the convenient access my only issue is the phantom alerts saying my checking account has some five figure amount i wish and is below my limit i have to log in and get all the way into alertswhere there is no new messageto make the new message indicator go away a bit of a bother i have iphone ,1i use this to pay off my credit card after i use it the deposit checks through a picture feature was crappy the last time i used it but it might work better for certain checks as for viewing accounts transferring money between accounts and being able to stay on top of your banking this app is stellar,1i usually dont take time to rate or review apps but i like the chase app so much that i decided to make an exception the app makes my life a just a little bit easier and i would and have recommended it to other chase customers it is easy to use and the check deposit feature is fantastic i have deposited numerous checks with no hassle it reduces the need to go to the bank which is how my life is just a little better with it,1the ui of this app blows the competition away it is easy and user friendly everything i do the most with my bank is right in the dashboard i also use wells fargo and had boa and honestly chases app feels they are light years away from the other two it actually feels like an ios app optimized for the iphone not a copyamppaste of the full sized website with a sluggish speed,1this is a useful and efficient ap but like other iphone version aps you got to wonder if the developers actually use them since there are things so simple but missed one of them here is alerts you cant tell which account has the alert if you have only one account i guess its easy however but with kids and different chase accounts its not there are other limitations too but largely very useful,1well im barely doing that anyway as a college student but the chase mobile app has made figuring out my finances a cinch making payments for rent bills etc is extremely simple with quickpay depositing checks on my phone is fabulous and to top it all off the new look is really clean and somehow puts me at ease even when my bank account drops to the double digits way to go chase,1ive had this app since i first opened my account with chase so far i love it its easy and safe to manage your accounts with this app in a rush and forget to log off the app will log you off automatically you can also control your alerts with this app as well deposit checks and transfer money around to your other accounts havent had any problems with it so far,1most reliable app i have on my phone since i downloaded it a year or so ago i have had zero problems with it it never crashes and always responds well to anything i need most issues listed are user error or settings issues if you are a chase customer this is a must have to track purchases pay bills or my most used feature transfer funds,0for a month i have been using this app and just used it last night  when trying to use it today it wont let me log in and directs me to download the latest version  when i download the version it then states that i need a certain iphone in order to download  i have s  i have no way to log on now as the process keeps telling me to download a new version then states my phone is not compatible  i moved to a state with no chase branch and used the app to deposit checks thru my mobile phone  i think its time to get a new bank close to homesee ya chase,0i recently got a chase card and was excited to download the app to be able to do my banking easily online like i do with everything else i forgot my password and tried repeatedly on the app to reset it it kept telling me my new password didnt follow the guidelines i kept trying new passwords it kept telling me the same thing i go onto the online site and have no problem changing my password and am able to log on easily i go back to the app with my new password and again its telling me its incorrect this is a simple app even the smallest local banks have and somehow chase cant figure it out,1extremely easy to get the info on your accounts when you need it in a flash the functionality of being able to preview your balance without logging in is especially helpful they just added the touch id platform so no more need to enter your password i think chase understands the needs and concerns of their clients more so than most banks and they take the steps to implement it promptly,1im a chase fan the products the facilities the new offices are amazing but this is my favorite service they have this app has never defaulted they keep it working perfectly at all times no bugs nothing funny they were the first ones to do remote check deposits and the quick pay option is so great its been a long time since i dont have to go to the bank and that is just priceless,1i love this app it makes life so much easier and your banking more convenient my job doesnt offer direct deposit so when i get my check sent to my house i love that i can deposit my check using the app its awesome i also love how i can send and receive money almost immediately with the quick pay feature this app has saved my life on more than one occasion ,1this new app is so user friendly and made easier through the touch technology no more getting locked out of the account due to fat fingers and bad eyes on a phone  the only thing i needed not available on the app was a click to change the account address since i live two states away from the closest chase i need the app to do just about everything,1like all chase customers we would like this app to work  check deposits have been a problem for months i actually called chase on line support to report the problem was given the run around that i just drove to my closest branch lets get the chase support staff trained as the branch employees are i had to laugh when one of the phone support associates told me to go back to an apple store and learn how to use my phone lets get these folks trained to be as half as good as apple employees now that would make us all happy,1not fond of the new design but have gotten used to it the most annoying part is the touch id for apple devices i dont feel i should have to enter my password to transfer money or pay my credit card bill once i have logged in with my touch id this is very ridiculous i want to quickly pay my bills why do i have to put in my password after already logging in with my fingerprint please consider adding the option at least to not require a password to do these things,1chase has put a lot of effort into creating what i consider the nicest looking most reliable easiest to use mobile banking app available  i dont use all of the features but it sure seems to do more than competing banks apps  the interface is attractive and ive never experienced any timeouts or access issues created by slow internet connections  bravo,1this app has the fingerprint feature so you dont have to type in your password manually i love it i can pay my bills with this app transfer money i dont need paper receipts anymore because my current and previous transactions are on this app i have a miniature bank in the palm of my hands its very fast and it shows your accounts activity instantly very quick very easy,1easy app now jus if they had an option to see deposits only transactions like online also if their email system would email on time and not after the fact a direct deposit was made over all the app is good i can easily transfer money to my daughters account also enjoy the thumbprint sign on too except i changed phones and the option dropped,1i think its so convenient that i could do almost everything on my phone i do not consider typing my password multiple times a hassle i believe it would be added security if we could have more than one password a different password to make a payment or something like that however that would drive most people crazy so i am satisfied with the app,1i love this app chase has done a great job in making an app that not only allows me to transfer money between accounts but also lets me pay bills and send money to people i know who have chase without having to go to the bank the app is very user friendly and with the touch id option it is even easier if you have an account with chase then you need to get this app,1the app has made banking very convenient for me i use it quite often and hardly need to visit the pc website or a physical branch secure and relatively easy to use only complaint is that it does not seem like i can make a particular account as default on the notifications having to select an account each time on the notifications panel before i can see the most recent notifications can get slightly frustrating,1i love this app it is easy to access see your activity make transfers navigation is incredibly easy but theres one things that does bother me why do we have to type the password when accessing the alerts or messages if we already authenticated with our fingerprint to access balances make transfers deposits etc why does the alerts section require us to type the password it is annoying and unnecessary other than that great app ,1i use ebay all the time for both buying and selling i buy more than sell but you can definitely find good deals if you shop a little ebay always takes care of customers first for instance if you buy something that is not described correctly or broken ebay will be on your side and help you get your money back quickly i love ebay and recommend this app to everyone,0i love having this app to use on my iphone ive been using it for the past  yearsi hate having to be prompted to update before this always happens when im in a rush to see my balance etc id much rather be prompted when i sign out to up datei turned my friend who has an older iphone onto this app amp she loves it too now no more chase app for iphones under ios  so shes sol and shes not the only one she tried to use the website but the timing is wrong for iphone verification and the website hopefully youll work this out for your customers because this is a real bummer,1its does what is necessary and helps somewhat with the need to doing bank transactions at your leisure  when you cant get to the physical building itself however there are still glitches that need rectifying but i guess in due time it will bemy major issue is with the alert notifications  hard to access and tell to what account it belongs well nothing these days work  guess the glitches keeps the techs busy,1i absolutely love the chase mobile app it makes banking so convenient you can access your accounts so easily and perform basic functions especially when you dont have access to a desktoplaptop or youre too far from a branch you can deposit checks send money in seconds to other chase account holders check balances transfer money pay bills i love everything about this app i recommend it to everyone,1i live downtown and the closest branch is always packed and the other close branches are not convenient to get to because of the parking situation this app lets me do everything and i love it you can transfer money from one account to another  even family members and friends you can make deposits and its user interface is so friendly and easy to use if you have chase you need this app,1i have always liked chase as banking was simple i could deposit checks or cash through the atm or photo this app helps with photo deposit while i lived near several branches  i couldnt alway go during their business hours so chase making banking convenient and electronic is a plus especially since i have moved and the nearest location is a  minute drive versus the  minute drive it used to be,1i like the account preview feature it gives me an option when i expect a large deposit or withdrawl i can take a quick look see without having to open up my account i would like an option for the alerts to cancel from the account notice if i view them on my phone alerts instead of having to open the app iphone keeps alerts for up to as long as set in the options of the phone,1i love three key features of this app first you can use the phone camera to deposit checks second i love the touch id integration so that i dont have to type in a long password to check my balance third i set up notifications for any charges on my credit cards so that i can immediately see any unauthorized transactions this app is extremely useful,1the app is great overall for checking balances and transfers between accounts however i have been having a problem with the push notifications for overdrafting even tho my notifications are set to alert me i dont get the notifications until i have an overdraft fee go through this has happened multiple times nowother than that this app is great i just wish i would get the alerts that i direly need instead of some of the lesser important alerts,1i luv being able to open up the app punch in my password and see all my accounts its ease of use is perfect for me transferring money is a no brainer and chase quick pay is awesome  the only thing i can say that is not so great is paying someone thru quick pay that doesnt have a chase account need to make it simpler especially for other bank account holders to receive ,1theres nothing more convenient than being able to handle an array of banking items directly from your phone compared to other banking apps this one does exactly that and much more deposit feature needed improvement but developers appear to have answered as it has been working flawlessly as of recent thank you for listening to your customers and for developing such an amazing app,1this app offers all of the access to my account that i need it lets you see balances individual transactions review electronic copies of statements and make payments access to the account appears secure but simple as well allowing finger print recognition as an option for signing in i cant think of anything else i would want to see in an app for this account bravo,1excellent and intuitive app ive been using this app for over a year it works seamlessly and has full functionality you can easily see all account activity it supports bill payment and chase quickpay to send or receive money fingerprint id is now supported on iphone to view accounts but you have to use account password for an actual transaction i like this added layer of security,1love this app ive never had a problem with it amp it is so convenient to be able to do everything on the go i use all of its features from quickpay which my roommate uses to pay me for her half of rent since i cut the check to our landlord to paying bills and transferring money between accounts it is such a life saver i recommend it to all of my friends who dont have it yet,1for the most part i like the app im able to deposit checks without much hassle with the camera checking balances is great scheduling payments works on the day i assign  the alert inboxes leave a lot to be desired i can never figure out how to delete the messages i cant access email settings from the app unless it is because i use a tablet  of the time im getting paper statements on my business account yet other email comes though the inbox just fine i havent changed anything,1crashes when checking alerts doesnt happen often now would like to be able to create messages and check messages summary status of accounts  ie checks deposits withdrawal  etc  ability to sort what looking for mimicking as if online at computer doing the same thing like if searching a check has cleared etc ability to download statements from phone,1you have to click on the i to get info about your credit cards  if you have ultimate reward points it takes a couple clicks to look for the redeem points such a pain  deposits take  hrs or more to post the system is down on the weekends too many times  deposit amount limit is low compared to other banks  i hope the feedback doesnt sound horrible but you guys need to fix this people have other bank apps and the comparison is major,1ive been using the chase app for iphone since   the improvements along the way have been sufficient  i like the finger print technology  however its a bit annoying to have to enter your password to make any transactions after the fact  i can understand and appreciate the security its just inconvenient to have to use your fingerprint and your password  otherwise this is a great app and i love banking with chase,1i use this often to check balances and my credit card  the touch id works well on my iphone   the layout is well organized and easy to navigate  i like that the deposits show up in a different color and i can easily navigate through the checks and deposits  being able to deposit checks on the go is perfect i seldom need to go to the bank now ,1ive had this app for some time now it just keeps getting better with every update checks are cleared quickly and ive never had a problem with any of the accounts i have with chase this app makes it simple and quick without having to drive anywhere its so easy and saves me a lot of time love it i would definitely recommend this app to my clients and friends,1i usually detest when people rate something poorly for what its not  especially when they go in knowing it but i dont think this review will stop anyone from becoming a chase customer or downloading the only app available if they are already a customer so im going to use this as an opportunity to talk about security touchid is definitely a nice to have if us bank can do it chase can but it could not only catch up but lead by implementing two factor authentication why is my hotmail account more secure than my money,1i like the fact that you have almost  of all services as if you would access it through the website normally you can transfer money to accounts and a multitude of other things i also enjoy the contact numbers are ready for dialing through a click of a button depending on which department you need,1it does the job overall however there is functionality that you get with the desktop that is not available through this app for example things like clicking on a checking account debit and being able to see the image of the check  as you drill down and try to do small little things you begin to realize its limitations hopefully version  will remedy the situation,1the only issue i have is that the notifications for balance are not accurate it will send me a notification of the balance being below my limit i set but when i go into the app that notification should have gone out the prior day and some deposit has already clears and everything is oksimply there is at least a  hour lag on notifications they are not live,1love chase bank not only the best bank also best app so many functions that allow me to bank at any time of day online deposit is just one of the items that i am crazy about also can look at my balance without signing in thank you chase for all the great features a bank could provide and more i am looking forward to see what else they might come up with,1the current version for ios works very well the app is mean as a decent range and features and hardly ever crashes so long as youve got a good wifi connection you have your basic banking needs done efficiently i like the way it links together of my accountsincluding credit cards and credit lines its so handy to have these features on the phone since im not always in front of computer,1the only real issue i have at this point is that i keep having to reauthorize my touch id i have it set up for convenience and no one else uses my phone but every so often i have to reenter my password that might seem easy enough but i dont have it memorized so i have close the app and go into my password safe to retrieve it kind of a pain especially when i just want to make my payment other than that i really do like the improvements that have been made in the past several months,1never had a problem with this app it saves your passwords if you want is super reliable and is quick and intuitive to use i use it for pretty basic things like checking my account balance transferring  or paying bills one thing though is their atm finder isnt great at least in nyc there are atms in every duane reade and they rarely show them overall good clean app,1most of the time its really nice and snappy but occasionally when i open it up it is slow and wont log me inedit they have changed it a lot since i started using it four years ago i really like the way that it works and it has become very streamlined and is easy to use i love the fact that i do not have to go to the bank to deposit a check i can just do it straight from my phone wherever i am,1overall this is a solid app there are always things that can be better but the chase developers seem to be in front of the curve on banking app development i saw the review mentioning the quickpay policy change and the app communication being simply a front end on an old clunky system and while i agree those are problems they are chase problems not chase app problems,1love this app on my phoneopens quickly love chase bankinghowever i wish the same functions were available for the ipad app i cannot do all the same functions as in my phone ipad app needs improvement it needs to revolve along with my ipad screeni use my screen on landscape but have to revolve it to use the chase appthe app for the ipad does not offer all the functions the app for the phone does needs improvement,1i dont know what you guys did but i just deposited a check thru my iphone and it took about  seconds everything worked the first time what a pleasure thank you in the past i would have to take no less than  pictures on each side because the computer couldnt read it it was very frustrating but it was smooth and worked like a charm today way to go chase ,1when an app is supposed to be purely for convenience its extremely inconvenient when half the time i cant get a check deposited for whatever technically glitchy reason im also not sure why there is a deposit limit even for private clients if funds must be verified before being available added one star because finally quickpay doesnt require the recipient to do anything to accept the money anymore  it just gets deposited,0ok here is a tip chase if the app is temporarily not able to connect as is frequently the case could it figure this out before the user types in the password its really frustrating to be denied again and again after taking the time to type in my password unnecessarily  this app used to be wonderful the format is clear and easy to navigate when it works unfortunately over the last many months i would estimate that ninety percent of the time i cant log into my account by this app because it indicates the system is down,1great app mostly convenient lately however as another customer has noted in the last few months i keep getting an error message stating too many attempts at login not i use the touch feature and only try once before i get the message and therefore must reset my password this has happened several times in the last couple of months and is getting highly annoying please fix this glitch,0ever since i downloaded this app ive had multiple issues with signing in i used the thumbprint sign in and then suddenly it isnt an option anymore and every time i enter my password it says wrong password so i have to go through and change my password and it works a few times then it says wrong password again and the cycle continues so annoying i prefer just to use the thumbprint but they must have disabled the feature or for some reason it isnt available to be anymore ive also tried deleting and reinstalling the app a few times but that didnt help anything,0i wish this app would notify you immediately when a transaction and payment is made i always wish the balance would reflect that instead of showing pending with other banking apps the moment i make a payment its reflected on the balance even though it may not post for  days same thing with the charges the charges may be pending but it reflects it on the balance instead of the balance jumping way up after the charges post   very misleading and is the main thing i dislike about this app and chase,1ive been using this app for years yea the fingerprint login stopped working a while ago for some reason i was going in between phones at the time so i just assumed it had something to do with that i type my password in every time really not a big deal dont recall any time ive ever been remotely upset with this app apparently people have issues but i havent knock on wood,1after reading a few of the negative reviews rating this app i have to be honest and say that i think it must be operator errori havent had any problems so far and ive been using it for about  years at home and on the road i do nearly all of my banking through this app and i highly recommend it for anyone who likes quick access to their money,1i am able to pay so many accounts with just a few key strokes  no postage no waiting all transactions are in real time  i make deposits and i can see what is going on with that deposit immediately  if a deposit requires a waiting period i can see when the hold is released  i can do it anywhere anytime as long as i have a connection,1if you want to use an app to access your chase account on an ipad you have two choices either you can use the actual ipad app but type in or remember your login and password every time or you can use this iphone app on the ipad blown up to fit the larger screen and put up with the waste of space while taking advantage of touchidi do the latter  but its silly that chase forces me to make that choice this app does work reasonably well for a phone app so im giving it three stars,1handy for when you need to check your balance or need to transfer from saving to checking or when you need to send money to a friend or family member who also has chase but this app can literally be a life saver for example if you lose your card you can transfer all your  to savings so that who ever finds the card cant use it,1august updated works w fingerprint sensor data entry not a problem convenient to use amp presumably saferwas great before latest update glitches when entering deposit amount on plus unless backing out of data entering screen by using icon on left of screen cant take picture instructions really slow down entry and give impression of dumbing down the users it works but not as easily as before,1i just opened a chase account bc i received a  bonus this app was one of the reasons i went to the trouble of doing it the only thing i wish was that the deposit limit for the check image capture was higher  just doesnt seem like enough i have direct deposit for my paycheck but if youre going to add that feature maybe limit the  of deposit items but not the amount otherwise i would give this app  stars,1i can conduct online banking about as well as i could expect which is usually looking up balances and transactions however on my ipod touch the branch and atm finder does a very poor job even with a strong location in downtown seattle it failed to find a branch or atm within a half mile despite my being a block from a branch as google maps helped me find and now it will not update my location so all i can see are the branches near my house without any refresh action available i am stuck,1i love that i can view my bank accounts as well as see my credit card balances with the app i wouldnt change anything  i also love that i can take a picture of a check and not have to go to the bank to deposit it  awesome app i also love that now i can see my reward balances from the app  one more thing thats great about this app since you can see your balance on your accounts if one of your accounts is low you can transfer funds from one acct to the other  chase you have thought of everything this has to be the best banking app out there theres only one thing i like to see in a banking app which is a basic calculator  so you could add and subtract without leaving the app,1i did really live this app once but over time its gotten worse and worse the quick deposit feature used to work fairly well but even with the new mp camera it just gives errors now the alerts feature has changed too instead of all alerts being listed together  you have to navigate to each specific accounts alerts to get the badge to go away it wasnt like that before most apps improve with each new version this one gets worse,1great app helps you manage your account only bank with quick deposit technology works great i have had this app for  years now and have had no issues a lot of the complaints are user created the app is great the quick deposit has always worked for me no errors no incorrect alerts except for those that i registered for the app like the bank is at the top of its industry,1my depositing is working just fine i love the app and it makes it so much easier the deposit i get a lot of checksthe notifications are sometimes wrong and tell me im overdrafted when im not which is quite unnerving and it would be great to be able to take the check pictures with the + volume button on the iphones like normal pictures but i am quite happy with the app otherwise ,0chase even while connected to wifi on your most updated version s updated and restarted i cannot see past the first page of my accounts deposits transfers ect  used to work perfect and i utilized very resource now it doesnt work  hold your developers responsible for missing these bugs and update it  customers complain because companies at your level have no excuse for a poorly designed app for mobile users  its inexcusable and irresponsible for a powerful company to fail this bad even after your email blasts and advertising of this brand new user experience the website is great mobile app cmon,1i really like this app it is so convenient and almost everything is great on it the only thing that i would like fixed on this app are the alerts even after checking my alert they are still shown so now i have like  alerts that never go away i think that it would be very convenient if u guys could put a clear alerts tab on the alerts page and have them not show again thanks i hope te developers read this,1i use it all the time very convenient and helpful transfers between chase bank accounts is really easy and the quick pay option is also greatonly problem for me is that the check deposit function does not work you are supposed to take a picture of the check within a blue box but that box never pops up for me the app always says that i didnt take a good picture so the check cant be deposited,1for a poor college kid like me this app is a life saver i can pay my roommates with the quick pay feature pay my credit card bill and add alerts for when pay day rolls around the new update is awesome the background changes depending on your location how cool is that so happy to have a bank that has a good mobile system that can keep up with my crazy life,1enjoy burning a whole sunday to pay and organize your bills  like paying bills with stamps and envelopes  then this app is not for you  seriously this app saves a ton oftime  i pay my bills in about  minutes  it use to take an hour plus  it helps keep my bills organized so that i dont miss a payment  all in all it makes the process of banking and paying bills absolutelty painless,1this app is awesome i love all the features i like how you can do just as much as if you were on a computer i like how chase post debits amp credits quickly i like how when you use bill pay it deducts that amount quickly so you dont get confused on what amount you still have available i like chase alerts amp tex messages are so quick to notify you of a purchase i just love everything about chase app amp chase banks,1chase mobile app is super easy to use love that i dont have to leave my house to deposit checks as i run a daycare and cant really leave during the day very convenient for me to transfer money to anyone  that is chase customers of course only downfall is if i need to add a new recipient i have to do it from a pc  which isnt a total kill just a bit inconvenient if im out and about overall i love the app ,1this app does essentially everything i need for banking with chase my work does not use direct deposit but i can deposit my checks from my desk in no time using this app it will transfer money between accounts or to other people almost instantly and without hassle the only time i visit the bank anymore is if i receive a personal check from someone with wild handwriting,1scary but convenient  apple if you opt in will now share your fingerprint data with jp to make accessing your account just a touch app gets better and better after the picture check deposits i didnt think they could be more sophisticated wrong again only reason its not getting  stars is  its a bank app  i cant just think up money yet and have it deposited  when yall make that possible i wont hold my breath,1never had an issue with it does everything i need to do as a freelancer my paychecks tend to come in the mail rather than direct deposit the check deposit feature on the app makes life much easier for me no need to leave work early to hit the bank fingerprint access to your account is neat too you can choose between this and your password would recommend,1i think this app works great i use it for general look up bill pay and quick pay stuff no problems other raters making complaints about it not having crazy features like linking to their phone contacts is ridiculous this is not social media and meant to do everything the full site can do let alone more than the full site can do its a great and useful app,1this app is simple to use and its very convenient when im not next to my laptop quick to log in shows balances can make transfers and deposits etc i cant really complain because so far what ive needed ive been able to do within the app hopefully the chances being requested by other people can be implemented later on to make this app much better,1this app does all i need from it and more from paying for my credit card setting notifications for certain things i need to be aware of to checking my daily activity the side swipe to quickly view current account balances is one of my favorite features and i use it daily the welcome screen changes depending on where you are,1i love this app so far very few problems with it im constantly on the go and this works perfect for paying my bills but i have no way of using the points through this app i like being able to see how many points i have but i have to go to the full site to be able to use them and the full site just brings me back to the app if i could use my points on the app that would be great this banking app is probably the easiest ive used,1am enjoying this easy access to my bank accounts  what a time saver my  daughter in an out of state college loves to send me quick pay requests amp its so easy for her to repay me too im not using touch id feature  enjoy mobile bank deposit  such a convenient feature but it doesnt work for larger size company checks just keep improving this app  its a great time saver for quick access to check on all my financial accounts,1love the app been using it for years but one thing has never been fixed even though ive complained about it beforeonce i receive a push alert unless i make a note of it i have to guess which one of my accounts its for once i log in to the app shouldnt the alert either a default to the account in question or b have a badge or indicator when you log inhopefully now this can be addressed otherwise a great app,1ive been a chase customer for about a year and ive been using the app just as long i havent had any issues and i love the preview screen and how easy it is to transfer money im about to open my business account and im excited about being able to maneuver quickly and easily though the app to be able to take care of business  two thumbs up ,1this is the only bankingcredit card api have ever had that gives me alerts within one second of the transaction the text alerts are fantastic its great having the peace of mind knowing anytime your credit card or bank account has been charged i have another banking app that will only email you the alerts apparently they cant keep up with the times,1this has to be the best banking app ive used  ive used quite a few different ones but this one has a simple layout is easy to navigate and has barely any lag its a snap to transfer money between your accounts and theres this great little feature where you can do a quick balance check without fully logging in to your account,1as others have mentioned if i have an alert i wish it wasnt  steps through the menu to view if for some reason touchid goes away when you are on the login screen ai cant see a way to call it up again i literally have to force quit the app not to have to type in my userpasswordi use the app all the time and for banking with chase it is great setting up bill pay transfers etc very easy,1most of the reason i switched to banking with chase is the online banking features this app allows me to safely and securely look at my balance pay bills and transfer money between accounts i cannot say enough good things about chase and this app the security steps and questions also help me feel my money is sure from hackersseriously great app switch to chase and

to keep track of your money it will even give you alerts about money being deposited and withdrawn from each account makes your banking so much easier,1if you have anything with chase this is the best app i only have there card well put together never a problem you can pay your credit cards it gives you at the moment charges you know exactly what you have been doing what your balances are good job on this app wish they all worked this wellupdating to say its still working great never a glitch one of best running apps,1basically its easy thats really important to be to have all my money information close at hand and available other banking apps have you jump through hoops to double check purchases or payments i dont have time for a lengthy login process to see simple info to ensure my purchases go through or my balance is where its supposed to be thanks chase,1chase bank is the best bank out there and their apps are easier to use than any other banksmy favorite is the fact that i get a text message within seconds of using the card thats great security that no other card i have does sure many send emails or text messages within an hour or so but chase is literally within secondslove this bank and app,1having a way to manage your accounts on the go is a very useful tool being able to do chase quick pay balance transfer and check accounts in seconds is quicker here than having to do the same on the computer touchid at times can be difficult with the app but otherwise i would recommend to all chase account holders,1fullfunction banking app lets me do everything from paying bills to transferring money any time i need to anywhere i am without having to go to a branch or even open my laptop but the best feature is the ability to deposit checks by taking pictures of them i do most of my bank business with this app and have never had any problems with it,1does everything i need when i need it and fast i love the fingerprint login it helps that the bank is my favorite bank and they have a great service as well the bank is there for you and good times and bad times and im just grateful for having a partnership with chase in short words no need for a computer all you need is the app  account and youre all set just easy and fast,1very easy to navigate through the app depositing my checks and paying bills is very simple and gives you a lot of notifications so you can tell when you check has been deposited or when a payment went through would like to be able to view credit card charges in order of statements and not just dates best banking app ive used yet,1not sure why people are so negative with the reviews the app is easy to use and it gets the job done it tells me how much money i have i can pay my freedom card and i can pay my other bills the mobile deposit feature works well yeah it might take a bit longer to clear but guess what i did it on my phone if only people knew how banking was back in my day,1often times i go to check my bank account and the app doesnt really keep up with it sometimes its down on sunday too if i actually use this app to keep track of my accounting it would make things very confusing but all in all the service at chase is great but the app could be better i love chase bank tellers are friendly and helpful the app helps me see if my balance is low before things get out of hand,1i have always use chase this chase app save me time and money since i dont have to drive to the bank for deposit save time and gas it is a win win situation no need mailing bill out cost bay stamp all that think about thugs that steal your mails or dumpster dive with chase app eliminate some of those risk if i ever loose my phone well last time fbi have hard time to crack open apples password  so that is the risk i willing to take,1better than boa and union bank ive tried both of those and chase beats the other two apps by far there are many more custom settings and chase quick pay beats anything union or boa have chase makes sending money way simple and fast bank of america is uncooperative and unwilling to help and they always will find a way to charge you amazing amounts of fees they basically kill it go chase,1when i moved to a town without a chase i opened a new bank account with a local bank only to close it a month later when they didnt treat me half as well as chase does this app keeps me a happy chase customer because i can still make deposits and have everything i need any time i need it great job again chase,1i love the check deposit by camera the available balance is always up to date or to the moment to be more exact i appreciate the text features too several times ive caught unauthorized use of my card before i lost any money the only draw back is the high  fee if theres no direct deposit of  or more on a checking account  thats a little steep otherwise keep up the great work chase thanks,1i love this app very convenient i can check my balances transfer money pay bills only thing with paying bills with the app you can only do one at a time with the bill pay if i have a few to do at one time its more convenient to do the full website i fairly recently learned that i can check my balances without logging in by swiping right i love that ,1love love love this app im shocked to see so many complaints the remote check deposit and bill pay are two of my favorite features along with account activity notifications to keep me alerted to any fraudulent activity ive never had any issues other than scheduled maintenance making it unavailable but they always give you a notification before it happens,1i love the chase app they have made banking virtually so is easy im always on the go and to be able to make payment online and view my balance keeps me on top of my money i use quick which is my favorite feature it makes paying other so easyof course they must bank wchase but it beats tracking that person down i love it and definitely have recommended it to many,1chase as a bank is ok could be better but the app is perfect easy to navigate and very self explanatory  never gives the you must use a desktop to use this function like other bank apps do also love the quick preview and the total available even when a purchase is pending to keep you all the way up to date on what you have available,1i love this app i use it on a daily basis to check my account view charges and to make payment the preview feature is great for a quick glance at your account without having to long in i enjoy using the quick pay option to send money to my kids account so many features in this app and im still finding out a moist have app for anyone who had a chase account,1this app has always worked flawlessly to transfer from my business account to my personal account and to use quick pay to send money to people instantly what use to require a long trip to the bank can now be accomplished from my couch at three in the morning in about three to five minutes it took much longer to write this review great job chase,1i truly love this app i love the convenience and the functionality of it i cannot say enough about itone feature i would love to be able to seeuse on the app is the ability to manages other accounts associated with ones chase accountin the way of not only be able to pay bills but to also freeze ones card if misplaced or stolen,1supporting many potential processes on mobile isnt easy but the chase mobile app does an excellent job i can easily check balances checking savings even my chase credit cards but i can also make deposits pay bills and transfer money easily i havent been to a bank in months because the chase mobile app lets me do everything i need to do online,1this bank app is by far the easiest to use i love being able to make deposits without going to the bank since the nearest chase is pretty far away the only complaint i have is that the checks take awhile to be visible on my account i only write checks occasionally so when one comes through i may not remember it and want to view it sometimes that feature takes a week to be available,1i can complete all my regular transactions with this app deposit checks transfer funds check balances pay bills etc very userfriendly and easy to access thumb print i rarely login via my laptop love this app however i wish the message center was available for use via the app meaning you cannot send or receive messages unless you actually log in from a laptop or ipad that is something that i dont like,1though ive been using the chase app on ipad the last  yearsim now using my first iphone amp immediately noticed how userfriendly the iphone app is compared with the ipad i prefer to do my banking from home usually on my ipad now i can use my phone privately  i like the interface better amp others have commented they prefer the website to ipad  guess its nice we all have options,1chase is  better than the boa app they do constant updates making the app better and better every time transferring money between my accounts was a headache and took days with boa with chase its instantly out of my account you can even see pending charges on your credit card and view your rewards points with a simple click i love this bank,1i dont know what is wrong with everyone elses app with iphone but mine works fine i have never had it shut down or ask me to change password unless i forgot password i enabled touch id so i wouldnt have to remember and it has worked just great for the last  months since i got new phone and installed maybe others need to do the updates on their iphone so it runs better,1the chase application is very innovative and easy to use i have not experienced any lagging or issues with the application yet i switched banks do to relocating in a different state and ended up choosing chase i was beyond happy with my decision and this application works perfectly i have used other bank applications such as first merit and huntington which didnt even compete happy with chase to say the least,1been using this app since about yrs now and have had no complaints at all everything works when i need it to and i can transfer money to my kids if they need it and its there immediately deposit checks immediately whenever i want also so its getting five stars from me because i have yet to run into any problems whatsoever,0i used to like the convenience of online banking but im very close to cancelling my chase account because of a recurring password issue every time i try to log on it tells me ive entered the wrong user name or password and im forced to change it ive called chase twice so far and both times got a very condescending support person telling me not to use a browser to access my chase account ive tried telling them i always use the mobile app not a browser but they just get me to change my password and act like theyve fixed the problem the app itself works fine for me once i get in ,1i really enjoy the chase mobile app because it allows me to do everything i need to do wether thats using the chase quickpay to send money to family or friends transferring money from my checking to saving or want to look at my statements this app does it all i really like that i can set my security alerts to my personal standard and ill be notified of anything i want,1as other reviewers have stated the app performs the tasks it was designed to do however it has very limited functionality meaning one is limited to only a few options to manage his or her account   at times this can be frustrating if one is on the go and is in need of information or if in need of specific features unavailable unless logged on with a computer,1the chase banking application works smoothly and allows for a supportive and interactive banking experience i would say i am very pleased that i chose chase as my primary bank since it offers so much accessibility while on the go i would recommend this app to anyone who needs quick access to information and payment options for both business and personal uses,1the app works well enough but i usually use my ipad in the landscape not portrait mode but the display does not rotate to compensate  therefore i have to read sideways or orient the ipad in the vertical or portrait mode  if there is another app or option that i am not aware of please let me know  this is not a complaint but request for updating or letting me know a particular setting to be able to read it regardless of screen orientation  thank you,1chase mobile app is convenient amp easy to use easy to pay my bill online notifications are instant after set up  i know my card has been charged the instant it is approved vess able to stop a fraudulent purchase in seconds from the time it was approved because my phones by my side this is my go to credit card,1totally love this app keeps me informed of what is going on with my account gives me warnings if something is wrong  plus it keeps better track of my account than the old fashioned check ledgers that i could screw up  about a week ago it caught a fraudulent activity that was able to be reported and fixed right away  thank you chase for keeping my account safe,1chases app is extremely convenient secure and versatile i love that i can check all of my accounts in one place as well as my ultimate rewards balancei dont like that you cant request a credit limit increase or an apr decrease for your credit cards via the app you can request a cli on discovers app but not on chasesi also dont like ads and constant bonus offers popping up everywhere theyre annoying and theres a designated area for that anyway please lose the ads,0the jpmorgan chase online banking app barely does the basics and even those functions require too many steps alerts are very difficult to manage  for example it takes far too many steps to read an alert the alert is not informational hey someone somewhere debited your account for an amount we cant show you and the app requires you to login in order to delete old messagesalerts and why not simply tell me the amount of each external transfer and name of payee is that too much to ask  i laugh whenever i think of jamie dimon having to access his account information using this app,1i like it so far it works for me no problem i like the print pass instead of password so far i can pay my bills send and receive money deposit money via camera which gets in my account faster then chase app said it would thats pretty good coming from a baby boomer who never had training in technology the calculator wasnt invented when i was in school you go chase,1i miss the alerts from the app i was receiving earlier this year im still receiving some alerts i just wish you had not changed the way i was getting my alerts if i didnt want the alerts the way i had them setup i would not have set them up like that i would love to have them back the way they where earlier this year other wise i may move to another bank that offers what i was getting from this app please,1the chase app is by far the best and easiest to use all accounts are listed clearly and i have never experienced a single problem using the app i love the simplicity of depositing checks paying bills and quick pay is a great to pay on the spot  i have used the app for years for both personal and business accounts and just cant say enough about how pleased i am with it,1does what it needs to do and i like that it shows my estimated balance even with pending transactions there are worse bank apps out there so i dont see why so many people complain obviously things that are pending do not always have to do with the bank but remain pending until the place you paid at takes the money stop blaming the app for pending transactions,1this app has saved me many times from making financial errors its simple to use for ease of depositing checks checking your funds and reviewing messages makes it all worth while chase also provides suggestions on how to make banking better suit your needs i have been with chase for so many years and have never considered switching saraage loyal chase customer,1i use this app everyday and have zero complaints about it intuitive and easy to use apart from the app itself i do find it inconvenient that the app is the only way to interface with my account online using mobile devices understanding it is a security is not being able to access the full website is still annoying,0for some reason this app always changed my account alerts from text to push when i have never consented it to do so now i have had  overdraft fees  because it never text messaged me about my low funds chase recognized the issue but failed to refund even one of the overdraft fees i have called and complained but nothing can be done so says the reps and even managers be cautious of this app because it will glitch and lock your account alerts options to push they have had to even have their senior technician fix the problem and as soon as i open the app it does it again this app and bank are a piece of crap,0i have had this app for about a year it normally works well for paying bills making transfers checking balances etchowever the online check deposit fails  times out of  it worked almost flawlessly the first few months i had the app but now it fails way more than it works i have contacted chases it department they recommended erasing the cache from the web browser and if that didnt work uninstall the app and reinstall it i did both problem didnt go away frustrating and wastes my time,0one of the main reasons i signed up for an account at chase bank was for the wireless check deposit i am very disappointed with the lack of effort they have put into fixing this problem i have waited over  months for them to fix this and have updated the app several times but the problem has not gone away it is not my phone i just got a iphone s and i still have the same problem i thought this feature offered by chase would save time and money having to drive to the bank to deposit checks but so far it has been a huge waste of time energy and my patience,1the best feature of this app is that i can keep track of all my transactions so that i dont have to worry about unauthorized transaction the moment that i swipe my card or click confirm for an order online the app would notify me that so and so amount have been charged to my accounti dont have problem such as those who use iphone  so hopefully chase will fix it,1this version of the app is so much nicer and faster than the one it replaces just a note if youre going to update this app make sure to check your alert settings afterward i didnt and ended up with a missed payment because the alerts i relied on with the old version didnt carry over during the upgrade customer service was very understanding so no big deal  but for someone else that may not be the case,1i use this app quite frequently and im very happy with it sometimes i cannot print the statements because ink is so expensive so i go in to my branch and the branches are everywhere and the staff is more than happy to help me ive banked with the other fdic insured banks and ive gotta say that chase is simply the absolute best im a customer for life thank you chase for making my banking life better faster and all around easier,1there is one thing that drives me crazy you get an alert and you can get all the way to a list of accounts but then you have to hunt and peck to find what the alert pertains to if you only have one or two accounts its fine but i watch over three checking accounts a savings account two credit cards and the overdraft account and this alert feature isnt quite good enough everything else however is terrific,1prob the most intuitive consumer banking mobile app out there and chase credit card benefits are nd to none however the credit card fraud detection threshold is so overly sensitive and unadaptive that i experience frequent and regular declines at even major metropolitan us cities i visit all the time let alone international destinations extremely frustrating needing to always call cust svc to validate purchases but the app  stars,1since ive had chase i have had no problems with the app they have kept it updated and very nice i dont see what all the one stars are about but its a bank app not a game its for you to check how much you have in the bank and maybe take a picture of your check yall wanted to do prepay bills do it over the computer its way easier and less trouble and common sense people,0like many of the iphone s users i am also not able to do the mobile deposit with my phone now im having the same problem with taking the picture of my check and trying to click the use button but all it did was zoom in what good does the zoom function do for the person doing the mobile deposit anyway the mobile deposit is the only reason why i kept the app if its not working and there is no estimated timed of repair i may as well just delete the app please fix asap,0still not optimized for iphone  or  plus so app looks really bad this app badly needs touchid support so i can use my finger print as my password to login can you also make it easier to show your account number and routing number i dont want to have to look through my statements or checks for my own account number and do a google search for a routing number consider adding a widget for ios  and push notifications would be nice to replace your text notifications i would think chase would be way ahead of other banks but other banks like simple and discover have these features already,1i travel a lot for business and use business mobile apps a lot  usability and ease are keys for me  a lot of these apps including car rental airline and hotel that i use most frequently have quirky user experiences the chase app has it figured out and is intuitive  it seems their developers pay attention to user flows and are always improving usability  great job on a great app,1chase has been the best bank ive ever been with and their technology has always and continues to surpass any competitor i love that the new touch pass was recently added chase mobile is user friendly and modern i do have an account with another bank and their mobile banking looks like something out of the stone ages compared to chase thank you chase for always being the best,1ive been using the chase app for years now its so convenient i get notifications when i reach my set amount to be careful of which i set high i deposit checks on it i pay all my bills on it i have automatic transfers and can transfer money myself from account to account every month its amazing if you like to have the convenience of banking online it will not disappoint,1i love this app very reliable and convenient i never have to go to the bank to do simple transactions for example i can transfer money from one account to another pay friends and family with quick cash submit check with a simple picture there is so much more to this app that i would never finish typing i simply recommend this app to everyone,1i bank with jp morgan chase and i have never had a problem with service in person or on this app you can tell the company values myself as a client and as a person they spent time developing a great platform that is easy for users to not only utilize but to feel safe with hisher finances i am extremely satisfied with choosing chase as the company i trust with my finances and this app is a personification of the companys loyalty to customer satisfaction,1this app has been updated since i originally installed it and it only gets better i can view my savings checking business checking and credit card all in one app i use it to deposit money and also to transfer between accounts it is very easy to use my favorite is using the quickpay feature to pay my babysitter so easy,1i have only had exceptional service from chase bank and their visa sapphire card and services  their app shows their true colors  a standout app that is rich in details and interface with touch id almost from inception of rd party support release from apple  you will not be disappointed by the app the bank and their corresponding products and services,1the ease of use and simplistic interface is much appreciated i am a developer myself and know how important it is to keep it simple and direct chase developers did an amazing job serving the data to the user in an in your face kind of way and keeping everything a click or  away everything i need to know about my accounts is at my fingertips perfection thank you chase for this,1this app is the best feature of banking with chase it supported check deposits via phone very early on and the interface has remained nice and clean with each update checking balances and making transfers is a snap i hardly ever need to go to the bank in person anymore theyre great about integrating new technology  the fingerprint signon support is just the latest example,1was i ever disappointed by this app in the + years that i have used it have i ever felt that the app malfunctioned lagged or glitched on me when it comes to digital banking i have never felt more reassured just from the consistency with which this app operatesi appreciate the simplicity because it ensures that the app will operate flawlessly please continue to do so this way i will never feel that the app will potentially make errors,1those whose need alerts to be perfect and are giving less than  stars rating are not being fair the fact is there are no other banks with an easier to use feature packed reliable app for banking  it is near perfect in my opinion and is so good that i find myself opening the app daily to check activities when i dont actually have a transaction to do or to monitor,1this app literally makes my every day life easier to know where my account stands at any moment is extremely important i have a card fraud on it before and i have underestimatedoverestimated the amount of money ive had in my account many times so it helps me know where i stand i absolutely love it also if i cant get to a bank it allows me to deposit money which i think is amazing,1not a huge fan of some of the fees that the bank hits you with but thats not what this review is about this app has come in so handy so many times the best feature for me is the ability to transfer money to my daughter at college im sure she would agree   the app is very customizable when it comes to alerts and is very easy to use  if you ever need help their help desk is very friendly,1this is by far the best banking app ive ever used i switched from a different bank and the app was really trashy switching to this was really refreshing and i love the ease of use and simplicity the app also does a lot more than any other banking app ive seen deposit checks set up wire transfer transfer between accounts use quickpay manage alerts etc,1there seem to be some serious differences between the website and the app versions one big difference is the ability to set minimum automatic payments  can only do that from the website also chase quickpay has to be initiated from the web version befor being used on the app version then there the issue with layout the app isnt too similar to the web version  especially the ipad app that can make navigation confusing for someone who goes from the web to app,1this app has made my life so much easier forget to stop by the bank on the way homeno problem remote depositinstant acknowledgment of deposit love it not all bank app allow instant deposit which bites and just want a quick check of balances without signing ingot that too now if chase could just give us some money lolit would be the ultimate of perfection bank apps,1my husband and i recently had to switch banks because we moved to a location that didnt have chase bank sad however changing banks made me realize how great chase banks app is to use its easy to navigate and has everything you need between checking your accounts making deposits and quick pay its a great app and is much better then their competitors apps i have used,0i love the app such a convenience ive been using it for a long time and it always worked flawlessly however with the latest update it keeps bugging out on me every time i open it it asks me for a token once saved its good for a day or two and then i have to go through the same process cause it doesnt recognize the device same thing with the fingerprint id i have it all saved and im able to login using fingerprint but after couple of days it will say i need to set it up again already tried deleting reinstalling and reapplying all permissions same thing iphone   os,1i use the chase bank app regularly and find it helpful and straight forward i would like it even better if it used touch id to log into the app rather than require entering a password as i use complicated unique passwords i find i have to open a password safe app copy the chase password and paste it in to complete logging in another wellknown national banks app i also use allows touch id and it makes using the app much easier thanks,1this app allows me to keep savings checking and my chase credit card all up to date in one place it makes transferring into savings or checking so easy having everything on one screen allows me to keep a close eye on my budget paying bills or using chase quick pay through this app makes my life that much simpler i would not switch banks and love this app,1i love this app the bill pay option is soooo easy i love finding out my balances with just a few clicks amp i can even view the checks that have been withdrawn from my account there is even a working feature to deposit checks within the app you would never need to visit the bank again unless you needed to deposit cash,1i love the convenience of roundtheclock banking and avoiding the banks sometimes  incompetent personnel im grateful for the safety of the case app over that of atm after hours i dont understand requests for password at some junctures when i have already signed in with fingerprint recognition a higher security level than password i also do not understand logic in limiting deposit amounts per day withdrawal limitation is logical for security but deposits no,1ive been using the app for along time its very handy  you dont need to call the bank or get on a computer to check your account or account activity simply the best app out there for banking  really love the pay bills option i pay all my bills in the matter of minutes and can always go back to see when i paid and the activity on bill payment ,1you are going to love this i am so glad the balance preview and the bank statements have been added this already useful app just got even better banking on the go is such a must for busy days the convenience of these features is a great addition id highly recommend using this app thank you chase for thinking like a customer would and making the changes,1for the most part the app works well but the programmers keep killing the alert badges sometimes completely sometimes only some of them if they cant keep something that basic working well what else are they messing upmight be a coincidence but within just days of my star reviewthey fixed the issue with the badges raised it to  stars,1ive been a chase customer since   they have been perfecting banking programs since that time  so the concept of a remote app is nothing new to them  you can do everything from balance retrieval to bill paying to remote check deposit  the check deposit is the absolute best and takes literally  seconds to complete  this app is banking convenience tied up in a nice neat bundle,1honestly i have not had any issues with this app it is fairly easy to use depositing checks or transferring money is quick and easy yes the password can be a pain but its just an extra security measure i use the site as well to check on things and use quicken to keep my books i have noticed that some places will take a few days to show up the account is not the apps fault even the website wont have it,1intuitive navigable user friendly and responsive layout is much more understandable than other bank apps one thing i would love is the ability to add external accounts and see their balances on the home screen becu app does this and i like that feature also quickpay is annoying comparative to just doing out of profile transfers cu can do them because theyre smaller but it would be nice for chase to try to progress to that,1with all of my notifications turned on and my alerts set this app is one of my most frequently used since day one this app is been very userfriendly and with any update it just gets better bill pay is great option it works well simply put chase is at the top of my list in the banking industry and this app is at the top of my list in the app store good job guys,1i have accounts at  different banks and i like this app the best i can see all my accountsincluding my kids and my credit cardsat the same time which is convenient i dont have to log on to different sites to handle credit card payments and to view my balance plus i can send money to my other bank as well as deposit checks all within the app i highly recommend it to others all the time,1this app has been nothing but great for me and is always there when i need it i have a checking account and a chase credit card and all of my purchases and depositspayments are updated extremely quickly i love how i can pay my credit card payment right from the same app i check my checking account balance from,1the best app for finance chase outdid themselves with these no more going to do transfers and making chase quickpay from the computer you can do it all in the app you can read your statements secure messages get alerts check your balance and recent transactions and more love love love it so far i havent experienced this app crashing and ive been using this app for about  months a++,1this app does the trick  keeps me up to date with my checking and credit card transactions  plus i can modify alerts which saved me a lot of hassle when some clown stole my credit card infoi received an alert for a gas station purchase in a city i was in  was able to contact credit card company and froze account  only one transaction and frozen  great job chase,1there are several features about the app that are easy to use and makes banking much easierthere are a couple of issues that are a little more complicated which could be improved  such as alerts  they are difficult to get to when you have several accounts this is not a huge deal but it is an example  perhaps you could have a focus group with users in person,1the application is stable seems secure and accurate what more could you ask for  new purchases are updated almost immediately you can monitor activity easily and this is important considering my daughter has a card as well easy and convenient to schedule payments through  i have definitely had an increased sense of security using it,1im quite happy with the service i have received every time i visit the chase site  i mainly use it for my credit card and checking account dealings and have had only one problem with it in the last year  it seems like customer service is number one with your company  thank you for the fine website  it almost functions perfectly  henry rex bils,1 if you dismiss touchid for some reason theres no way to get it back without killing and reopening the app which takes longer than remembering the password so its basically like use it the first time we offer or else  it would be nice to have a quick view option for balance information where you can just slide something to see a peek lots of prepaid cards and gift cards now have this feature within their app  transaction history should show date of original charge authorization instead of or in addition to when it posted sometimes when reconciling its helpful to know that information  why cant i sort by transaction type atm debuts credits deposits checks etc just an opinion but if the app is for convenience it would be nice to have convenience ,1the chase app is good however i wish some features were a bit more intuitive such as to check how many withdrawalstransfers youve had in a month from a savings account which the us federal government limits to  before fees are assessed you click a button that is more intuitiveobvious than an i in a very small circle at the top of your account info page,1i do like the app there are plenty of pros such as fingerprint recognition to enter the app but a few cons that are annoying is how quickly it times out while im switching to other apps such as credit cards by the time i switch back  which is approx mins it requires another log in another con inputting the fingerprint to open the app and then typing my password to quick pay someone but overall  because it is still a great app,1so far so great everything about the app has been good at work the way i want it too the only problem that i have is ever since i bought my new phone and transferred all my apps over the touch id no longer even pops up to give me that option when i logon so now every time i have to type my password and i did love the the touch id i thought that was a great feature and the app doesnt give me the option to turn it back on so that would be my biggest complaint,1you can see all of your accounts easily from the home screen and if you tap on an account you can see all transactions it also uses a fingerprint instead of your passcode if you want which is quite handy you can also wire money through this app and do many other things from here quick and responsive and laid out quite nicely,1big ups to the people at jp morgan amp chase for creating an app that makes it easy for those who work in the entertainment business sometimes i receive payments in the form of checks late at night or through other apps after a performance but this makes it convenient where i can do everything i need to without having to physically go to the bank unless there is an issue i cant solve by speaking to a specialist,1i constantly use this app to track my spending pay credit cards and deposit checks its extremely functional and userfriendly i love being able to deposit checks remotely and log in with a fingerprint i have actually recommended chase accounts to people based on the usefulness of this app and they continue to improve it to boot,0this app works well when you are able to login or use its features however the app constantly turns off the preview and fingerprint feature asking me to create a new passwordevery few days i go through the process of creating an entirely new password different from my last  because the app either removes my access or does not recognize the last one i entered as validat first i thought it must be user error but after dozens of new password entries in the last few months i can no longer recommend this app,1the app has gotten much better over time i manage  small business account and  personal accounts with it can access all  from  screen easy to  xfer funds between accounts alerts are lifesavers love the photo check deposit feature and bill pay is completely reliable had  issue where i couldnt change my bill pay according my with the app and had to use the website,1this app has virtually everything you need right at your fingertips i love that the app also recognizes the touch id to where i dont have to put in my password the only con i have against this app is that i cannot find a place to be able to hide or unhide some of the accounts using this app if it is there i have not been able to find it but then again im not that computer savvy,1excellent app the fingerprint scanner is a time saver its not always looking for a fingerprint however it would be nice if it was would like to see purchases made and posted on credit cards much like the debit card is listed i dont like having to go back to look at a statement for a purchase would also like to see all information about each debit and or vendor,1this app has changed my life i can manage my accounts my kids and make sure my bills are paid including rent and mortgage the quick pay feature is awesome and the money transfer is immediate how many time am has the teenager and college student text with an emergency too many but i can be in a foreign country and problem solved always works love this app,1i liked the new app on how it clarifies at the end that it did deposit the check to a certain account what i dont like are all the extra steps the new app has added after you touch the photo graph the back of the check icon is it really necessary to ask if you want to continue steps like these are unnecessaryit also often says the image is unclear when i have placed it in good light and the check seems fine,1the app has good functionality and i prefer it to the chase website  i use mobile for all my bill payments  the latest version has chase banner ads which i hate i want my mobile app experience to be about me not the bank the alerts need to be refined to when clicked it takes you directly to the related account not to all accounts requiring the user to find the account with the specific alert,1seriously what can be better than depositing checks from bed in your underwear the app is simple and just works it even uses ocr to detect the routing and checking numbers automagically out of the dozens of checks ive deposited this has only had an issue one time and the app informed me that there was a problem and i needed to try again id say thats a great track record,1so far ive used this app to transfer money between accounts it cant get any easier or faster im very happy with itfour months later im still happy with it i even deposit checks now chase has made it so easy to do so a transaction number is given immediately to youmakes one confident that the transaction went through fast and easy,1transactions will show up as pending the moment you swipe which is nice transactions usually take at least a couple days to postthe payment process was fairly simple but i had to go online on my computer to add the a pay account and they will not run payments on the weekends with my usaa app i can add nonusaa accounts right from the app my payments to my usaa card are instant even on weekends this may be because i have a usaa checking account but these are just a couple things i wish chase would do with their appi havent seen a statement yet so i havent messed around too much with ultimate rewards but the app will tell you how many points you earned on each individual transaction  so thats nicei will update my review once i get my bonus points from my card and it actually shows on my points balance,1this is where products differinnovation still need to be cybervigilant  years on the use one time i couldnt all check pictures were rejected but just needs update for convenience it is still innovative banking in your fingertips but always be vigilant of the place you are in before you log on fear of hacking but i trust chase has better resources than hackers,1i use the chase app almost everyday to use the mobile check deposit feature some improvements that i would like to seesaving credentialsintegration with touchid and support for multiple accounts  a picker list of all saved credentials lastpass extension integration  with my multiple chase accounts it would be useful for it to allow it to access lastpass to retrieve and autofill authentication credentials faster check scanning process the capital one mobile scanner is significantly fasterdeposit notifications  receive notifications to your smartphone when the deposited check has been received cleared nsf etc should be account agnostic and get notifications no matter what particular chase login was used to make the deposit,1i have used this app for years now and i never have any issues with it its very convenient to take pictures of a check instead of having to make a trip to the atm and i can quickly send money to others right on my phone it keeps an accurate detail of my account balance and the fingerprint authentication works really well i really enjoy this app,1very few issues i love the new look with the last paid date on the home screen i use two banks and this is leaps ahead of the other customer service is great also friendly and patient banking in general is annoying with all the fees and nonsense but this app is super easy to use to transfer quick pay bill pay and im not even all that tech savvy,1i cannot ever do without this appbest everthank you chase this eases myour life note to chase just one peeve i think as a privilege of allowing you to be my banker my transfers should be unlimitedi always get notices of exceeding the limit i dont know why this is buttransfers allow me to keep things in order when you limit me you seriously interrupt my order of things overall your service is among the best thx again,1chase asks if you know they have internet and phone apps so why are you using their atm as it turns out there are many functions you cant do on the mobile app but only on the internet site or in person but they dont tell you or refer you until your frustration reaches a point where you call out of desperation however it is robust enough to do everyday banking issues and is pretty good at that,1i have other bank apps and thought they were better as far as logons  but now logging in with my iphone thumb print makes this super fast and convenient  bravo and thanks chaseawesomenessupdate  make sure you dont try to set up two different users on the same device  i found out and stopped  everything is great,1the reason why i put a number one is because this app has no issues or any problems at all so if you have a chase credit card then this is the app for you its easy and fast especially when it come to making payments to your credit card highly recommend this app for anyone with a chase credit card ,1when you enter your password the keyboard should say go instead of done having to hit that pesky login button is one extra press i shouldnt have to make when all i want to see is my balance its ok that it doesnt save my password id panic if my phone got loststolen and the person who foundhad phone had access to my account plz fix the done key plz,1lucky are you seriously complaining about such a stupid thing like that dont you realize that this just came out and that chase is possibly testing the market to see how it does this feature is revolutionary in terms of banking and best of all its free and all you can do is complain and give it two stars oh and try getting direct deposit most people i know have that,1i use this app all the time until  days ago when all i get is a temporarily unavailable i need to access account information but cannot you get one star for no notice or at least explanation of why app does not work please fix this or i will look for other banking institutions that will give their customers better service than thisfinally seems to work again i can access my account thank you,0do not download unless you plan on keeping the same ios device forever the app retains your info and your account info is viewable to anyone else via push notifications and alerts even after the app is uninstalled and or the device is restored chase has been notified about this four times and apple has been notified once and neither seem to care or have provided a solution in a months time i am worried when i sell my iphone s after the  drops that my account info will be in the hands of whoever buys my phone so to avoid sharing your account info with strangers do not download,1i dont know what all of these fools are talking about the app works perfectly fine if you cant login you probably need to update your app just like chase said when they sent out an email to its mobile users i own my own business and the checks i get in the mail all get deposited by my chase mobile app its awesome i never have to go to the bank anymore this app deserves  stars,0update from my original review chase what happen you folks updated the app and now it constantly crashes everytime i take a photo for the quick deposit it will crash as well everytime get the fix out quickly for this app please you went from being the best banking app to the worst plenty of other banks in my area that offer marginal apps but yours has to be the cream of the crapyes crap come on chase i expect better dont release an app that is so buggymaybe test it out next timefolks stay away from the app until its resolvednot worth the headache and frustration,1i do not like that i cannot transfer money to my credit card now i dont like how everytime i want to make a payment i have to schedule it three days after the last one  i loved how it used to be because everytime i use my credit card i always transfer that money directly over to my credit card from my checking as soon as i spend it so i know its taken care of now i cant do that and i have to wait  days in between and it really screws up me paying like i used to i hate the new update,0i normally dont write reviews but i feel compelled to do it  i have an iphone s and this app has become worthless for making a payment  i just spent  minutes on the phone with a very nice representative who took my paymentall because i couldnt change the amount of the payment or even submit it using the next button  this started happening as of the latest update to the app  whats this good for if i cant make a payment  check the balance and then call to do that  really  i expected better qa from a bank with so much   i hope that this is fixed before the next payment is due,0depositing checks is annoying due to daily and monthly limits there is a firlto enter in the deposit amount  for some reason it does not tell u right away that the amount exceeds the limit instead it makes u go thru the annoying process of photoing your check then it tells u youve exceeded the limit  the app should either display the limit up front or immediately tell you if the amount you enter is too much dont waste my time in what is supposed to be a timesaving featurehaving a deposit limit at all is annoying too but is standard at the moment,0the app is fine for just checking your balance or paying your chase credit card but i am not able to transfer money through the app even to accounts that i have regular transfers set up for online i get a message that my accounts are not eligible for transfer and there is no option to resolve the issue calling customer support is no help either this is a huge frustration for me since this is the primary use i have for a chase mobile app i want to be able to move money between my accounts,1i love this app i can pay all my bills whenever i need too even in the middle of the night when i have forgotten i can transfer money between my kids accounts and time of day only issues with the deposit a picture check doesnt work for my primary account and when try to do it with others well i could drive to the bank faster love it and love chase,1the app is quick to load easy to access and im able to use it from anywhere i have internet access from moving funds to depositing checks this app is as helpful as it gets side note the old blue color scheme did look nicer and was easier to navigate through however it does not add and real complications just a personal preference,1parents used a small credit union growing up and we always heard about how awful big banks were to work with weve been with chase for years now as adults and i am frankly shocked at how great theyve been far more convenient good rates and great account related benefits all the way around no issues to speak of knock on wood super easy to integrate different accounts and this app makes remote management a snap,1pretty streamlined easy to log in to and easy to get all info i need i like the push notifications feature where i get a notification every time my credit card is used you can set the threshold spending to trigger this i wish the push notifications did not stay as alerts on the app once theyve been pushed to my phone ive already seen them i have to log on to the app to wipe that red number bubble off,0the concept behind this is great the app is slow and somewhat confusing i noticed i have to click things a few times to activate a new command alerts come through but they are a pain to get the message an example is you have a credit card and checking account and theres an alert in your checking chase app takes it to the credit card alerts which there isnt any alert  hope this among other things can be changed i really liked the way the app functioned just a few months ago,1i switched my checking to a small credit union in san diego and then switched back to chase just because the simplicity of the app its always been a pretty decent app but the quick preview feature made the app it is a very useful feature for like it says a quick preview like other users request i think it would be great if touch id could be used in place of the password thats my only request otherwise great app,1the app keeps getting better with every update having touch id available now was a necessary improvement very happy with thatthe only thing i would say to improve another level of security is the app should ask the user for their touch id or password if they click out of the app and then go back to it without fully closing it otherwise very nice update,1the app runs smooth i dont think it has ever crashed on me you can access just about everything from the mobile app certain settings you need a computer though they finally added touch id in an update today that was one thing they needed badly my only complaint now is accessing the secure message center is still a pain you usually have to load it twice to get your messages to show up besides that awesome app,1besides being a chase fan i love the convenience of the app as well  from being able to deposit from my phone to always having access to my account like all apps there are timeouts at times but very seldom and i do like the heads up the give when the app is going to be under maintenance my only wish list item is the ability to do bank to bank transfers,1ive been using the chase ap ever since they came out with it its really helpful when im out of town and have to do some banking without having to locate a bank another way ive used it when ive had to make a payment over my checking balance and able to transfer money from one account to another if you bank at chase get this ap,1its a pretty basic app it provides pretty much all i need to see as far as balances transfers and deposits could it be better maybe it depends on what other features people think they need for me im pretty much satisfied with how it is if i think of something else i think the app needs improvement on ill come back here and write another review until then thanks it works just fine,1this is the best every i live the easy friendly app this is the way banking should be the only problem i see with apps are how many people loose job because of the them but we live in a computer world today and thats just apart of life i guess that being said this is still the best app ever and i tell all my friends about it and chase is the best bank by far keep it up guys your doing a great job,1between business and personal expenses i always find it most convenient to bank and support chase theyre mobile app makes banking easy for all users whether im checking my accounts with the preview feature or sending money to the family i always have the capability to get what i need done by using chase  out of  stars,1this app is everything i hope for and expect from my bank i can do every necessary transaction from my phone my only suggestion for improvement is the integration with biometrics i turned this feature on for finger print access but i can simply bypass it by clicking cancel what security does that provide fix this and itll be the perfect bank app,1this app is super convenient and when paired with my chase slate card i feel like im in total control of my money every second i mentioned convenience right im a contract worker so i have to deposit checks myself a lot the app allowing me to do that and getting the money in my account within thirty minutes most times is perfection for me love it my friends with other banks are jealous,1ive had accounts with other financial institutions and none are as simple to use or as secure as chases the process of banking with this app is easy to learn and remember also before i retired from a small business i frequently used the app to deposit checks that feature saved me a lot of time that would have been spent in line at the bank,1this is a great app works as advertised i love the mobile deposit feature and it is very convenient to be able to check my balance and pay my credit card all on my iphone i hardly ever need to visit the website on my laptop anymorealso thanks chase for finally updating the apps interface for ios that was long overdue but it looks great now,1i absolutely love this app its easy to use convenient and secure i can easily make a transfer to my son at college view my balance check a statement see what has posted and find the nearest atm the site is easy to navigate and i can even set up different alerts i think chase has done a great job and i like the fact that everything is easily assessable to me thanks chase for keeping it simple,1love my chase app easy to use and go over transactions i use is mainly to check daily balance and deposit checks which is a plus when you cant make to a branch on time to deposit all i do is quick  check picture and then wait for check to clear but good thing check will show amd will cover all pending transactions cool,1never had any problems with this app or the service from chase bank one of the best options in my opinion i do like how you can go into your account and check your balance and what went whereand you can also deposit checks through uploading pictures which is handy from time to time i also like that i can set up custom notifications to help better monitor my money and where its going,1chases app is so easy to use and has multiple functions that make it convenient and safe  it is especially easy to deposit checks under  now instead of making a trip to the bank  being able to review account balances and sending payments with quick pay on a smart phone has been great,1gone are the days where you had to call the bank for every little thing now i have the ability to manage my accounts from the palm of my hands and its amazingupdatethe love affair still continues now dont get me wrong this app doesnt replace a human however it is a good way to do banking on the go if it wasnt for this app i wouldnt know if merchants overcharged me for different services,1i cant express how grateful i am to have the chase bank app on a daily basis there are times where i need to make transfers or pay bills immediately and without fail or falter this app has made it easy all checks are easy to deposit all transfers run smoothly and contact info or atm info is always available thanks chase for the time youve put into this app,1great app to find out how much money you have in your account i use it almost all the time only four stars though because sometimes it doesnt list purchases made right away sometimes itll take up to a few days to list that a purchase even went through usually for itunes and some other things very handy and quick to access just not totally accurate sometimes,1i log in deposit my checks make some transfers between my accounts pay my card pay some bills send money and request money through quickpay its always a breeze in between everything i need to do within the app never had a problem chase really made my experience with mobile banking outstanding thank you chase you have a loyal customer here,1ive been using this app for years now and its worked very nicely i dont do much on it other than basic personal banking things but it is well made for my purposes only thing i could go for is a little easier path to get to my alerts they also default to the savings account which the alerts rarely would apply for otherwise great app,1overall the app is great feature rich and reliable though i feel alerts and messages could use some ironing out they feel clunky and slow and are kind of a pain to clear notifications from having to dig through each account to find the alert to clear itotherwise its a pleasure to use especially compared to the competition,1i have been using the chase app for many years now to track my chase credit cards  it provides everything i need to track my spending and to make sure i pay on time  during the time i have been using the app it has been improved several times to incorporate new features such as easy access to overall account balances,1this app does not have the credit card link up facility like i have a chase account as well as chase credit card so if i want to see my credit card statement or transaction on the chase application it should be done also a direct transfer facility from saving or checking account to credit card should also be availablebut hopefully in future they will add this feature rest the app is simple to use nice app,1this is without a doubt the best banking application for iphone it is logically arranged gives all the information that is necessary to do banking and even allows the deposit of checks from your iphone and the ability to take a quick look at your balances is an ingenious idea it would get  stars if there were that many to give,1love this app it makes life so much easier my dad lost his card and his id is expired and they wouldnt take his paper id they give you until the plastic one comes in the mail so he was not able to get to his money but luckily my boyfriend has a chase account also so he was able to just quick pay and pull out my dads money for him  my whole family uses chase we all love it ,1i really love banking w chase im from ca but have moved all over the country and am now in hawaii where there is no chase but i refuse to get a bank here for now there are some issues i do have being as i do not have branch options where i live i cannot deposit a check over k via my phone soooo inconvenient and that alone may be a reason why i leave chase eventually most other tasks i am able to do on the app or computer but that will eventually be a deal breaker im overall otherwise happy with chase thank you,1i never had a problem with this app both on my s and now s plus paperless statements all there easy to transfer between savings and checking takes seconds for it to show up instantly can pay your credit card right there with your checking all the accounts and statements in one app i use the touch id and it works fineits very easy to use and clean love it,1the ap is great except i cant get the security message number to clear ive opened and read every security message but it still shows  unread message not a big deal but annoying even after several updates the message number wont clear out so i keep going in thinking there is a new message but there isnt one this annoyance cost  star for the  unread message that wont clear,1no complaints about this app its perfect you can do all your banking without having to get on a browser and the app updates regularly other banks have apps that you know were meant for iphone s best feature is quickpay i have used other rd party apps like cash or venmo to send money and theyre goodbut i always feel more secure here some of my loser friends still dont have chase ,1i like chase they think about technology and those who prefer to stay away from it i can do all i need with this app main tasks i like transfer money to from accounts  pay anyone like paypal  pay bills  see statements i am oldschool and like my paper statement monthly  you need that for proof sometimes amp i can highlight items get my face off the computer amp phones for a while but i have used the app for about  years amp like the simplicity amp ease of use,1i really like this app for most of what i do however it doesnt have the option to enable auto pay on my new credit card and im very frustrated with that according to chase the only way i can enable auto pay is in the desktop version of the website   i dont have access to a computer right now   so im screwed until i do  other than that its great,1i like the app i just wish i could make multiple credit card payments in one day sometimes when im doing my payments i pay different things off from different debit accounts and i would like to be able to do that all in one day instead of having to wait another whole  hoursalso the payments due date should be more accessible like on the front page with the transactionsgood app otherwise no as user friendly as some others i have,1does everything you need it to do and its useful but it feels slightly clunkier than discovers app not many people use discover comparatively and i probably wouldnt think twice about this if i had never used the discover app before  just pointing out the fact that there are ways it could be better even though its quite good,1chase has won my heart they have a program for vets that gives you free premium checking for vets this and home depots reserved premium parking for vets are the only perks ive ever used im a big fan of case and the best app in the business i love the fact that when i make a purchase over my set limit i get a notification via text or email instantly chase is so impressive,1easy to use app remote check deposit is an awesome feature thats offered at no cost the best thing about it is that when you use your debit card its automatically deducted from your balance immediately making it much easier to keep track of your spending i would definitely recommend chase to anyone wanting an excellent banking experience,1awesome app can transfer money easily with quick pay i can send money to family or friends super easy with quick pay  the money is available intantly also i love that i can check my balance on the go  if you have chase you should definitely have this app  i can even deposit checks through the app saving me a trip to the bank,1clear and concise does what i need with quick access update not as quick anymore since the ability to log on with my fingerprint was deleted with one of the updates it is better organized then before so thats a wash i use it almost daily and since i also use the prosper app for all my accounts i have a better idea of where my money is going,1the main reason i use bank apps is to deposit checks and of the  bank apps i have i like this one best one bank has a ridiculously low limit on mobile deposits and another one has an autophoto feature which does not always take a good picture chase has always worked perfectly for me  fastest and easiest of the ,1i appreciate having this mobile app so i can check on transactions when im on the road also appreciate the fact that i can make a transfer to other accounts or send money from my account to someone while on the road yes the app needs some fine tuning but im still thankful to have the ability to access my account through this app,1i love this app chase is a good app all about the customer service one thing i would love this app to do is if we can possibly add options to set up appointments when we need to go to the branch some branches are so busy that you have to wait hours and hours it will be great if we can set appointments set up through the app and show up at the bank and be taken care of right away,1love this app  from the integrated touch id feature to the effortless mobile deposit i have never had an issue using this iphone application the necessary updates to keep the app secure and comply with regulatory requirements never seem to be done at times that interfere with normal day to day banking needs  i think it is great how chase keeps up with tech advances to continually make the app experience better,1for me the touch id is not consistent  of the time it works that includes killing the app and restarting it and the constant you must update to use this app i realize it is for security reasons or whatever else but it always seems to do it when i just want to pay the stupid thing i use it for the basic things paying checking out  balances ect so maybe thats why i dont have a lot of problems like others,1very easy to use i dont know why everyone is wining about things and giving it crappy reviews if i have to do something that doesnt work on the app for example make an additional payment towards my car the purpose of cell phones are to make phone calls so that means i can call chase and make other payments like a big girl this company is awesome,1love this app especially like being able to name each account to keep things straight i use the app daily seldom a problem i agree with the person who said it would be nice if there was an easy way to tell which account has an alert i have a number of different accounts and this is very helpful like the phone app better than desk top,1this app is gr the only problem i have with it is not being able to log on at my own leisure occasionally the app will not allow me to log on for no apparent reason an error is displayed saying temproary error please try again later when that occurs i log on through a web browser and i am able to access my account info just fine so once that small problem is fixed this will become a  star app,1i love the deposit anywhere feature the check recognition feature works quite well i also like the fact that transfers between accounts at the same bank go through instantly thereby making payments seconds after the transfer,1ive been using chases app for a few years and finally getting around to reviewing it absolutely makes my life easier to run my businesseven though i mostly use it to deposit checks i never have to even think about going to an atm id give it  stars but every once in a great while theres a hiccup during the deposit process and i have to go back and try again later other than thatlove this app,1i like being able to quickly log in and see all my balances paying my bills online looove the quick pay feature and quickly doing transfers i also really appreciate the check deposit feature i do wish payments to some of my payees would be faster than  days  and wish payments between banks would also be faster but that involves dealing with external entities,1i like how simple and easy to use it touch id is pretty cool i dont need to put my password highly recommend to use this apps the down fall of this apps is its annoying to keep asking me to rate it everytime i open the apps so here we go im giving a review so that im done doing my part i hope its automatic that i give them star because im still using it and i will never erase these apps on my fone,0ive used chase for something like two decades the chase website and app used to be really good streamlined and well designed sometime in the past year or two it got sharply worse today it took me ten tries to even get so far as changing my password while squinting at the tiny text and deciphering terrible error messages and i write software for a living i pity the ordinary people trying to use the appi guess theyre trying to economize by hiring cheaper designers bad decision now im reconsidering whether i should continue even banking with them,1its good and does  of my day to day needs easily  there are others that have more functionality within the app  like your credit score is not a whole other website  its contained within the app itself  it would be nice to also set up reoccurring payments in the app and not have to go to the website  i wish it would stop asking me every day to rate the app  doing this then doesnt allow me to use touch id,1while this app is useful there are some flaws to pay specific bills automatically you have to have the payee address besides the account number the setup is not simple and is easier to go to the payee website and setup an autopsy through them it would be helpful if there was a budget function included on the app also  for the most part this app serves its purpose and is handy with notifications and use,1i deposit all my checks transfer funds and pay quite a few bills with the app so convenient when youre not at your pc couple of things dont function too well and have to get on the pc but do more than  of my banking on the appthis is my updatestill love it especially the fingerprint login use it more than ever hardly use my pc at all for banking,1ive now missed  credit card payments because i did it go through all the screens the last screen looks informational and does not have good visuals to make you realize you have to press the button yet again to actually authorize the payment shame on me for not reading in detail but it really does look like you are done with payments on the prior screen when you hit that button from now on ill prob pay on desktop,0i used to use this app daily and i love it but recently ive become really irritated by it i dont live near a chase back so i always used quick deposit to deposit my checks but as of recent every time i try to use it i get a message that it is temporarily unavailable ive called and asked about this issue and was basically given the answer to uninstall the app and then install it again needless to say that didnt work and i still cannot deposit my checks no as thrilled with this app as i used to be,1i love all the location photos as i travel a lot however arizona is my home state and all i ever see is the grand canyon and arizona is so much more that that it is one of the most beautiful and diverse states in the country i would love to see different arizona locations the app is super easy to use and very intuitive i dont receive all of my alerts in a very timely manner sometimes its a one to two day lag,1if only it were equally quick and easy to come up with the actual money with which to make the mortgage i just might buy another home or twoif some outfit offers me a chase credit card with benefits too good to pass up knowing such a fleet app is available for account management can only entice me further  well done,0used to love this app and never went to the bank and was able to deposit checks from my business every day now i have tried several times days different checks and i always get the message not clear enough for deposit the checks are very clear and legible and all from clients whom i have deposited their checks before with no problem now this app is useless for me  and yes i have the most current version of app phone network and have rebooted multiple times and tried multiple devices i have the app on very disappointed,1the reviews didnt really help out because it had negative responses i disagree with allot of these comments i think its a great app you dont have to go online and wait for the page to load its right there for instant access it does everything that you would be able to do with the regular website great app i recommend it to anyone who has a chase account,0i pay this card from  accounts with the same bank  branch banking amp trust the select pay from account screen attempts to list the full name of the bank meaning that the end where i might see an account number is truncated essentially for my three payment options i get to choose between branch banking amp trust branch banking amp trust or branch banking amp trust maybe if the app allowed rotation id be able to see the account numbers but this app does not allow rotation so that solutions out very surprised the developers didnt test longnamed payment options this oversight makes the app wholly unusable im using iphone s,1deposit checks on your phone check your balances whenever you want this app is very convenient for the busy bee and also your average samaritan you are also able to pay for your credit cards and also transfer money to accounts or other people if youd like super convenient and i love the new look to it from the most recent update thank you,1i love this app so much but i dont like the point system setup i think its fine to charge us  after more then  within a month it will be great if for every deposit made within that same monthly cycle the bank would give  back to you so instead of being a  it would be a  and if you make another deposit it would be a  now and so on,1chase has done it again ive never had any trouble with any of the versions of the chase app it always works and im able do most if not all of my transaction through the app the only transitions that i have to into the branch is large transactions i much rather take those in anyway thanks chase another great job with this and all updated versions of the mobile app ,1im a devoted chase bank user and i love this app chase has been doing the phone deposit thing the longest and i love how they continue to improve the functionality user friendliness aesthetics and helpfulness of all of their online and mobile tools even though i live a good + miles from a branch or atm i very rarely feel as though my bank is not available thank you chase,1nice app for banking but i recently had  issues the first was in a store wanting to make a quick transfer just before making a purchasewhen the app gave me no alternative except to do a half hour download to update it the second was just about to confirm my transfer when i hit one of the buttons on the bottom toolbar and had to enter everything again good app hope they can use this constructive criticism,0its faster to just go on the browser and log into the regular website because at least i wont be asked to update im ready to switch banks they keep forcing me to update as if they were the single most important thing in my life technology shouldnt be annoying i think their software guys have nothing better to do so they keep convincing senior executivesmanagement that we all really need these updates every couple of weeks i mean they probably want to keep their jobs right like do you realize that most people have + apps on their phone and annoying me every time i have to check my balance is not helping,0chase goes a bit further with the app design than other banks do so i will give them that but it doesnt mean they can stop there the entire interface feels slow and troublesome to navigate technology should simplify our lifestyles yet i still have to enter my password when there are features such as touch id they could integrate its not optimized to look right with the iphone  plus either the time as well as the other icons at the top of my display make me feel as if im an old person who needs bigger font step your game up chase,1this is amazing it does everything you need it to do for a app its quick easy and simple there are somethings you just have to log on a computer for this all is not meant to be up to par with everything you can do on a computer its meant for fast easy on the go type transactions when you are not near a computer or a atmbranch this is a  star app,1i have been with chase bank since   ive used their first mobile web interface and the first app which was just a shell for that this newest version is the best in my opinion ive used it for transfers quick pay bill pay and alerts i especially like that you dont have to log out to search for atms and branches overall a solid and beautiful banking app,1so far ive been using this application for a long time and i believe its getting better and better make my life much easier one couldnt imagine sometime ago that telephone will take over computer applications for banking and so much more banking with this application is so easy and can be done anywhere improvement over the years its amazing thank you,1chase just added touch id this just makes everything better now when i change my password i can just touch id and not have to keep relearning a new password which i have locked away elsewhere i love that i can make money transfers on this app and it works easily i almost like the app better than the chase website because this app is so clean its pretty much all i need,1at first the app was very annoying to use it hadnt been optimized for the iphone  plus but now with all the recent updates the app is one of the best banking apps you can view statements which other apps dont offer you can log in with touch id and you can preview your balance without logging in and the best part is that it all looks great on my iphone  plus,1huge improvements over the past couple years the chase bank app now works flawlessly transferring funds between multiple accounts quick pay amp even depositing funds by simply taking a picture of a check with your phone this is the future of bankingexcept its already arrived well done chase well done,1ive been a chase customer since  and i have to say chase has done a great job of innovating  early on in the late s citigroup beat chase to the punch with the touchscreen atms but somewhere along the way chase kicked it into high gear  chases app was the first i believe to fully embrace mobile banking allowing users to photograph checks to deposit them now i simply use my touch id on my iphone to log in  great app,1i love that it takes me just seconds to log on check my balance and also pay my mortgage and credit card on here it has saved me countless times when i was traveling from home and away from a computer its simple and clean to look at no frills in this app also ive used it to deposit checks before and was amazed that it really works,1love the fact that i can literally do anything from my phone with a simple thumb print there are infinite possibilities with the chase mobile app pay a bill deposit my check track my activity quick pay my momoften used transfer money from my checking to saving and way more only down side my husband gets to many updates ie i  m shopping with my mom lol,1i enjoyed the fact that it has a different background for the locations you travel to the alerts and quick access helps me maintain my account customer service is on point and extremely helpful i also enjoy being able to find an atm or banks because i dont like having to pay fees for taking out my own money overall great app,1this app is great the new preview thingy is great now instead of logging in i can just flip my finger and there are my account amounts now i am not a pain when i am in line in the store i dont have to make others wait while i would log ini do not like that they target poor people with service fees i pay  a month just because i am too poor to meet the requirements to avoid a monthly fee that is so wrong to do to people who can afford it the least,1chase online banking is the best for personal and business banking i have all the tools i need to manage my money i love the deposit by phone feature i love being able to enter information about my transactions great for tax time i love quick pay easier to use than paypal i use it for personal like my hair dresser and business to pay subs my subs love it too chase online rocks,1so convenient easy for me to check my balance without having to log in a life saver when it comes to transferring money or paying bills i use this app to check my account daily and the alerts allow me to know when my account drops below a certain amount and how much remains in my account a must have for someone who is constantly on the go and is an avid spender,1this app has made it possible for me to keep banking with chase even though i moved to an area with no branch within any reasonable distance i can pay my bills transfer money accept wires deposit checks pay my car bill view current and past activitystatements for accounts and credit cards etc great app works without any issues or lag or crashes,0it used to be so easy to schedule a payment with this app but recently they made it so that you have to enter your password before you can schedule a payment i use touchid to login and my password is a random number generated by password youre really going to make me look it up to make a payment when you let my login with touchid what a dumb change is the team at chase afraid that someone is going to do a drive by payment on my behalf but only after ive logged in with my thumbprint must be because there is literally no other reason to put such a dumb roadblock in front of me giving you money,1title says it all i love almost everything about this app checking my accounts transferring money depositing checks paying my credit card bill all made easy with this app the use of the thumb scanner as password to access the app is brilliant and well done if they could just fix the secure messages to make them easier to navigate or something,0im a long time chase customer with multiple accounts i like the way the app looks but looks mean nothing if it has no function why why why cant i make a reoccurring monthly transfer this app makes me enter monthly individual transfers that stinks push notifications is hard to setup and hard to switch between accounts in your app last thing please bring back your awesome rewards program because the current one is horrible im  this close to switching to discover card for there rewards program,1the chase app is by far my favorite app on my iphone i access it daily and it is what keeps my finances always in control it is so easy to navigate whether you are simply checking your balances confirming that direct deposits have come through paying bills or transferring money  its like having your bank in your pocket i would never leave home without it,1i have banked with several other banks and using their apps were a nightmare especially when trying to submit transfers it was almost impossible to transfer money from savings to checking with other banks apps i love the chase banking app so much i have my auto loan with them because of the simplicity of use the fingerprint access and quick account preview is great,1easy to use i especially like the deposit feature  i can deposit a check at  at night and not have to travel to the bank or be concerned with undesirable people watching me  i also recently had my credit card with chase compromised  they called me within a couple of hours to notify me cancel the old card and have a new one on the way,1i had many problems with this app years ago but the bugs are worked out ive used apps from two other banks but chase is the best now if the bank could be more helpful to consumers offer lower interest rates and back off of pushing their high interest credit cards this would be a perfect banking institution,1pretty much everything you need in a banking app touch id login check deposit check viewing to just name a fewwould give  stars if they straighten out the mess that is alerts you cannot tell which account for which an alert was generated unless you select each account one at a time looking to see which has most recent alerts please let me see alerts sorted by time regardless of account,1the versions have changed and improved over time but this version is the easiest to understand and access i love that i am known and can see my information almost instantly and feel as if i was talking directly to someone best of any bank i have ever tried to use my friend has b of a and it is so hard to find anything wish he would change to chase,1best bank and bank app ive ever had everything is always up to date with my accounts i love snapping picture of my check instead of going to the bank i like having access to all my account and i love the figure print scan for a quick login the only problem ive been having is logging in at night the app will just shut its self off this is a recent glitch and i hope they fix it soon,1i like the app overall but when you try to make a payment view messages or do anything other than look at the current balance you have to enter your password why bother having fingerprint recognition when it doesnt access everything your password can  if i have enabled fingerprint access to the account it should have the same authorities as entering my password,1i love that i can check my balances deposit checks review activity read my messages and just do so much with this app this has significantly more functions than my other credit card apps thank you chase for putting a priority in developing an app that can do so much and proactively finding ways to make it better instead of just reacting to complaints we notice,1keeps trying to make me turn on location setting that interferes with the finger scan frustrating so yes i will rate you since you asked so my answer is no to location and i understand my answer the app works well to access my accounts both business and personal i can monitor and pay my credit card  ah and chase does not support text search of transactions that is why most my money is elsewhere good goals but still stuck in  like most big banks,1very convenient and user friendly i us this app to check balances transfer between accounts pay bills send money to friends that bank with chase and to transfer funds to accounts with other banks ive never had a problem and rarely need to log on via my computer for additional functionality,1love this app and only one complaint if you could call it that i wish i could do all my check deposits remotely instead of there being a daily dollar limit i guess thats because i am a small business its annoying to only be able to do part of my deposits remotely and wait a day for the rest or take the rest into the branchalthough i do love my branch so i guess it forces me to say hello to them every now and then,1convenience is the number one reason people and with a particular bank obviously chase knows that and used that strategy while developing their app this app is simple and convenient i really love this app i use bill pay pp all the alerts and i love the fact that you can use your fingerprint to access the app of all the banks i have or work for this app is by far the best and easiest to use,1use it a lot but one thing bugs me i can see alerts with fingerprint log in but not the secure message center alerts for that i have to enter password its just an alert put them all together give user the option to make more secure if they want but for what it tells me fingerprint is enough  other than that i really love being able to move money or make deposits with the phone very easy,1the only way any app gets a highest mark from me is if the app gave me money so a  by me is  we strive for imprvmnt everyday app works well as long as apple continues to encrypt i will say viewing my creditcard bits is easier via phone than digging out the laptop any day chase continues to aim to please in my view a way to make it tweaked a lil better via location show me the closest physical chase bank nearest my locale regardless of where i am thank you chase,1works well however when i chose the request to write a review i had to enter my apple id password which was not touch enabled i doubt thats your issue however that too should be touch enabled and you might get more reviews checking activity on my card daily is my best defense to unauthorized use so i appreciate the ability for activity notifications via text as well as easy login touch feature,1ive been using this app for several years it does a nice job of handling everything i need in a mobile banking app i move money around to different accounts make credit card payments check balances and there are plenty of alerts you can set up to let you know what is going on finally depositing checks is a breeze all in all a very solid app,1quick pay should be instant my chase account to my sons chase account it has always been instant and a great feature especially for emergencies now it has to be a business day before pm western standard time thats insane why wait a business day when its been instant and should remain other banks are offering the same services so we may all be changing soon if quick pay isnt instant,1this app is so helpful its almost unbelievable  keep track of the balances in all your accounts set alerts for balances deposits you name it also allows you to deposit checks with your camera shows your transactions pretty much up to the minute allows you to update your info with no hassles highly recommend,1i love that most banking apps now have touch id and sometimes credit info with advice as well as current details the only reason this review would be a   stars if that were an option is that the credit details could expand further without additional chargesmembership as some other apps offer for free with your account,1i struggled with keeping my account balance in the positive for years most of the time it wasnt because i didnt have enough money but i keep most of it in my savings account and pay for things out of my checking if im ever unsure about what is there i can pull it up quickly i can stand at a checkout transfer money by phone then pay the cashier its great,1long time chase customer and i use this app on a daily basis i rarely ever actually need to log into my account from a computer since the app provides function for just about every feature available if you bank with chase then this is a must have tool to manage your accounts and your money,0my main grip is that when looking at transaction activity they took away the smaller number showing what your remaining balance is at the time of the purchases not that i think they are jipping me but i like knowing before you could see like twenty of your most recent transactions and if you wanted more just hit the show me more button now you have to make sure youre in the monthly statement everything outside the viewing of your account works well but honestly thats all im really using this thing for,1this app is one of the main reasons i bank with chase  with other small banks and even some larger ones their apps and online banking services make me want to pull my hair out with frustration this app works flawlessly and chase quick pay is revolutionary as well i recommend making the best of your banking life and using this app just as i do every day,0ive used quick deposit several times in the past im not sure why the app is now so sensitive to the picture deposits it is able to get the routing and acct number from the image but then refuses to accept the deposit and tells me to go to the branch this is a huge inconvenience i tried my ipad i tried my relatives iphone super annoyedchases app was created before bank of americas and i cant understand why no one has thought of adding a travel notice feature and a foreign currency order option cmon chase,1i think this is the best app on my phone i like all of the functions of the app and use them almost daily the credit card use set at gt uncovered a fraudulent purchase last christmas that otherwise may have gone unnoticed if i had waited for my monthly statement i pay  of my bills using the app very quick easy and convenient wouldnt want to not have it available,1the chase bank app is extremely easy to view and use  ive yet to have any issues with connectivity and it has not ever crashed  being able to take  seconds or less to check balances statements and bill pay is a huge plus for me  keep up the great work no need to get creative and change things around here,0this app is useless cant see actually transaction accept dollars amountchase is not the only bank who using out of the country customer service rep but you can request to been transfer to usa rep hop donald will take care of this issue too as far as fraud they are the best other banking can let you switch computer without verification but not chase and yes i do agree with the other guy chase dont care about small customers even not small business only the real big one but i have to say that my despoilment is with chase in florida state when i was living in ny i was very happy with chase,1they asked again new system faster easier and even more user friendly i just wish you could pull up deposits without going to pay bills first thats a pita but i can live with it absolutely best bank app out there we have another bank and doing anything is so convoluted i just get mad or frustrated not here its easy and it works  all i can ask for ,0i have spent the last hour trying to recover reset my password so i can log in to pay my bill so i follow he recovery steps but when i have to make a new password nothing i put in will work ive followed every password rule and then some then before i can figure out something that will work with the insane rules i get timed out for inactivity how can i be inactive when im putting in password after password trying to find something that will work this has happened like x after being timed out i have to start allllll over from the beginning they want to get paid but wont allow me to do it so frustrated,0constantly have to create a new password every month i have to use phone pay and chase says theyll make sure they fix it its been  months and  passwords later and i get locked out every time and have to call and they give you their typical we understand your frustration bs you pay the bill over the phone and then they dont care and say theyll look into it bs they just want you off the phone and their money i expected more from such a massive money grubbing bank that cries to the government that their not making enough money spend your gazillions where it counts fix your horrendous app,1the app is pretty much okay except for the ads for car sales and other such items if i wanted to check on car sales i would do so i dont want to have have it shoved in my face every time i go to my bank app if the bank wants to promote sales of some sort then they should have a section called sales promotions so those who are interested can go there and those who arent do have to have this stuff shoved in their faces ,1initially this was a musthave app to deposit checks without having to leave the house but now paying bills adding payees setting up automatic bill payments canceling payments and many other tasks are just as easily done with the app as via computer or an analog means of operation just waiting for my iphone to let me withdraw cash from it directly ,1loved the new app when it first debuted it made life a lot easier for me keeping track of my transactions however there still is a time lag with my touch id it doesnt always pop up when needed and i have to keep starting it several times to have it appear also chase ads are hard to get rid of and stay on the lock screen despite opening and then closing them that needs to be fixed fix these issues and id happily raise my rating to  stars,1this app is worth changing banks for fully functional with a wide range of features which are super simple to use the recent addition of the ability to use fingerprint logon is excellent  i cant say enough about this app really love itbeen using this app since it came out  its by far the best banking app out there does exactly what its supposed to do and is loaded with extra features a must have,1this app keeps getting better with every update its obvious that increments of features transaction amount limits etc is slow and deliberate but then again this giving access to your bank accounti have not had any problems using this app and the addition of touch id is yet another welcome improvement  hopefully touch id coming to ipad soon,1one of the more useful and customercentric apps out there today  the only draw back i see is the functionality once inside each account is somewhat limited  example when within an account you have to move out of the account to a different screen for deposits not a big deal just cumbersome,1the fact that you can bank from a small square in your pocket is pretty cool in and of itself im  and i still think its fascinating the fact that people are giving it one star based off of a touch id login is pretty sad the app is easy to use quick to transfer and navigable ive used it for about twothree years now and never had a problem,1i have no complaints works good enough for me occasionally it takes me a while to figure out how to find theturn off the notification badge but thats minor it does what i need it to do edit i guess with the updates im being asked to review again so far so good still works for my purposes havent tried the touch id yet but im kind of a late adopter on all things tech so itll be a while  theyll have the bugs worked out by then ha,1i like this app it is convenient and i can check my account at anytime it is easy to use i do wish when checking the messages that you could just choose which part of the account you have a message on instead of waiting for one to load and then moving to the section where the message is about but overall i appreciate how quickly my payments show up in my balance,1ive been with chase since i was  so ive had the app ever since im  and im so loyal to chase this app gives me everything i want and more the design is well laid out and i get easily pay my chase credit card every time i call a chase customer representative they are smart efficient resourceful honest and above all respectful of my time i thank you and i will continue to be a loyal customer,1i am happy banking with chase bank branches are easy to locate everywhere you go deposit online  is the best i wish chase bank will restore the service on rental deposit giving the tenant an atm card for deposit only that is the best features that i am missing overall service and updated technology is excellent,1easy to use and access mostly self explanatory i enjoy the speed of access as well as closing of the app  unlike many other apps which can be slow in doing both of course like any other app it could use some tweakingimprovements and more features are always welcomed especially in the alert notification section,0i dont understand how such a big bank doesnt have a better banking app for iosdepositing checks has turned into a buggy disaster  ever since they introduced zelle into their app depositing multiple checks has been broken  the first check deposits correctly but if you select that you want to deposit another the deposit will fail  if you do not choose deposit another and just manually go to deposit another check it will work  chase if you want to continue to be my bank please pay closer attention to your ios app,1update from y ago contrary to the recent mixed reviews my fingerprint login works perfectly and in short i love it makes the app even more convenient and accessible  plus five more stars _______instant check deposit is fantastic i havent even updated to the latest ios which usually conflicts with most apps newest versions but chase is surprisingly fast amp has sleek navigation impressed,1i think the functionality and menu options are easy to navigate  i too have had problems with fingerprint functionality on my iphone but when there is a problem it effects all apps  and altough i dont appreciate when my account info isnt available i dont associate that with the app but with we services,1ive used this app for well over a year and have had no issues the only time i have problems connecting is when im out of wifi and my cellular service fails me often i love the convenience of having access to my accounts at anytime being able to deposit checks and do transfers with simple and intuitive clicks good job chase,1not much to say really but i do enjoy using the chase mobile app  i am totally blind and im always concerned about accessibility and im happy to say that the app is very accessible  i did become a bit confused about the actual meanings of some alert settings but by trial and error i think weve got that one covered now too so all is well  now ill just enjoy the app and keep up the great workdennis nelson,1yeah it may look like the mobile site but who cares does chase charge us to have the app noso everybody out there lookin for a talkin app or a prettier app please shut upi understand it completely i can transfer pay bills view credit card info check my bal its a free app that works doesnt freeze up and close every  min and is easy to usejust give me add a payee and its perfect i never knew chase had so many shallow clients oh well cant please em all,1the online deposit feature is great and its definitely my favorite feature but its hampered by a low daily limit i can pay existing payees easily but i cant add a new payee through the iphone app  also id like to be able to modify pending payments right now ive got to hit the website from my mac to modify payments all in all im very happy with this app but its not yet a replacement for the full website,1make chase quick deposit available to ipod touch g users certainly the technology is available to do this not having this capability makes chase banking not as convenient as it should be the lack of this feature for ipod touch g makes chase look as if they are behind the times hire a new head of mobile banking if you have to but chase please get this done asap i am tired of having to go to the bank to deposit a check,1people keep complaining that the quick deposit doesnt work and thus give  stars this app is far better faster and more reliable than the b of a app with cool features that would be nice of they worked on the ipod but they work seamlessly on the iphone  love this app everything that people are complaining about that doesnt work  other banking apps dont even offer,1very nice features for a mobile app the alerts are not set up very well and are not easy to get to they need to simplify and organize this part of the app better it is hard to see what the alert is if you have more than one account and you have to go through a lot of steps to get them to clear it would be better if you hit an alert button and it had your accounts with the alert logo on the corresponding one,1ive been using this app for a while and the core functionality is great theres an annoying bug with the apps badge notifications though  they wont ever go away ive tried accessing each individual alert and each individual setting option but the badge never clears i eventually simply went into the main settings panel and turned off notifications for this app which is hardly a solution once thats fixed its a fivestar app,0i have been using this app for ages to do my banking and deposit checks i keep up with updates and never had a problem until this week i can no longer deposit checks via my iphone s i get bad picture cant connect with server and a variety of other dialogue boxes sometimes i get to the final submit then it tells me cant find server  not sure if this is a bug or the update needs fixed but i do know that for the last week this app has been useless for deposits   fix this issue and ill go back to five stars,0after one of the updates at some point my app stopped sending me notifications that my balance was below the level i selected it caused me a few embarrassing trip to the grocery store when i couldnt buy what i had wanted because i didnt have enough in my checking account it used to work fine so i had no reason to think my funds were low obviously i should have kept better track myself and now do but i thought that i could rely on the app to help me out other than this it seems to work fine,0ive used this app happily for years but after recently upgrading to iphone s i can no longer deposit checks  this is very frustrating since it is the primary feature of the app for me i too have the same experience as other reviewers in that i tap the photo button repeatedly hold the camera as still as possible and yet the photo will not take this cannot the a problem with the device as my camera works perfectly and my photos turn out beautifully chase  please fix this,1this app is my life i have control over my account  i dont have to be seating in front of a computer i can check my account whenever i want and wherever i want this is the best part about it i never have any problem with it its always running nice and smooth everyone that has a chase bank account should have this app downloaded on their phone you wont regret it best app ever,1this app is so easily functional and has so many features at the touch of a screen i have to agree with another reviewer that it would be nice to be able to see photos of the checks posted like you can when you are looking on its webpage on your home computer not a huge con but very satisfied overall love chase been a customer for  years and i have zero complaints,1app is beautiful and has a really cool design the only reservation i have is the alert process you have to go through like  menus to clear out the alert bubble on you phones screen its not a big deal just a little encumbrance sometimes to get to it other than that i love the changes that were made especially to the design,1so far i have not had any issues with the app its stable and i have not experienced any performance issues  i pay bills view balances use the push notification options transfer money look up checks and sometimes look up locations with no issue i have not however used the deposit checks via mobile phone,1love the convenience of banking from my phone it saves me trips to the bank also the new redesign is beautiful its easy simple and mirrors the current design trends chase did good keep it going definitely recommend this app for chase bankers makes it easy to check my account love that it send me alerts so i always know what is going on with my money  stars,1i rated the old version  stars but now i cant see my running total before and after a transaction how am i supposed to know what the balance really is when something is in pending status i have had to transfer a few times thinking that i didnt have enough  when it looks like the balance was after the pending transaction would be cleared im sure ill get a charge if i transfer any back into savings so ill try to wait until next month,1it was easy to do quick look banking before to see what has posted now with the bright colors and the new font that they use it makes it harder to see what youre looking both at and for the older simpler version was so much easier to use also i really dont care to see a picture of miamifort lauderdale on the login screen  quick buttons with the simple blue amp gray background made things more streamlined,1totally customerhostile  this app crashes when taking a pic of the check to be deposited  whats worse is you are forced to upgrade  to this version you cant go back to the previous version  i have not tried this version with depositing a rebate check the last version simply refused to let you complete the deposit and then flag it for a human to approve it later you had to take the three dollar check to the bank and waste time and gas to deposit it,1growing up my family use local bank decided several years ago switch banks and go with chase it was a good decision the chase app is a lifesaver i able to check it daily deposit checks transfer money things i could never do that with my old bank only thing i would change  is chase should have hour grace like a few other banks have,1i currently use this app and love it because everything is real time i can transfer money and its available right away the only thing i dont like is the direction that its heading i understand they have to compete to be the best but dont compromise the security of the clients which is what i think the new account preview does anybody that has my phone has that access what if someone steals my phone then they can now access my account,1 reviews before me broker said it right this app will no longer let me use it unless i upgrade my os my os  works just fine and i dont want to upgrade other then this problem the app has been cool for years this most likely is just apple and other companies trying to make us upgrade our older phones so theyll slow down and well want to buy newer phones ive had my iphone  for two years and its worked fine without upgrading it till now,0i use both chase and bank of america apps for deposits  i am constantly having to go to the atm when i try to deposit using the chase app because it only seems to work if the check is personal check size the light is perfect the stars are aligned and all is right with the universe  the b of a app automatically turns on my phones flashlight senses when the check is centered and sized correctly and automatically takes the photo of the check when it is acceptable  i have never had a problem with the bank of america app  take a lesson chase  its really almost funny how far behind you are on this,0i liked the original version better it was more simple which for me made things quick and easy the layout was more similar to the nonmobile view like from a computer but streamlinedi loved it also scheduling a quickpay or transfer has more steps than before and the tiny dot to touch to receive money sent to me is annoying for me the app is for convenience and now its too many steps and searching for how to do or view things i use this daily and always just wish it had not changed,1hooray for touchid and proper iphone  plus support  this is a pretty good app that offers all of the functionality you would hope for from a banking app  someone was complaining that they couldnt see their account activity  its still there i have no idea what that person was talking aboutso why am i taking off a starthe secure message center  it is easily the worst part of the chase online banking experience  the part of the app dealing with it is buggy and i find the whole thing altogether unnecessary  i hate getting emails telling me to check messages somewhere else  just tell me what it is that you have to say  you put almost all of the important info in the subject anyway  i wish i could turn it off for everything except fraud alerts,1i use this app quite a bit to pay bills and keep track of my expenses with me only being  and working for a fire alarm company im always on the road and at work so i dont have time to get to a computer so this app comes in handy to quickly check to see if i have money available and it even tells me when my paycheck comes in very user friendly,1i have been using this app for a long time and it never fails me i really like depositing my checks through my phone since i dont have direct deposit but it is extremely convenient to have that option on the chase mobile app  the touch id to login into the app is a genius idea finally i dont have to manually login yay keep up the good work with the updates ,1good app everything i need is there the check deposit sometimes fails to read the check image and then you have to re enter all the details and retake both pictures it would help if the sw would try to read the routing and account numbers as soon as the picture of the front is taken and report a failed read right away while still in that portion of the app,1i hold an active account holder for both wesbanco and chase bank where i use both of the mobile banking apps the chase banking app is always quick easy and efficient i never have trouble while wesbanco mobile app is always delayed and very inconvenient to use  i definitely appreciate what chase is doing since i am very busy i love to be able to easily handle my money with no hassle,1ive had other banks and none have worked as precise and efficient as chase bank i am a new member and they have always answered all my questions resolve all my matters great customer service every possible service that you might need they will have it to offer it to you chase is the way to go psi got my disney chase card it has always been my dream to go to disney,1if i could give it  stars i would the app is clean easy to use and never gives me issues my only issue is that the home screen is a little too simple it shows your balances but it requires and extra click to see anything else much like the website itself id like to see it display when the next payment is due and how many ultimate rewards points i have for each acct,1i really enjoy what chase has done with this app its awesome that they have added touch id support i also use usaas which i think is the gold standard for banking apps chase continues to follow suit by adding mobile deposits adding biometric recognition should be next on the list other than touch id i love chase quick pay functionality but would also like to have the ability to edit my profile from within the app thanks chase,1i have been using this app for a while now and it is great and easy to use it is easy to sign in especially with the iphone touch sensor and quick to check for funding amount however every once and a while the touch sign in would cause the app to crash and i would need to type in my user information a bit of an inconvenience when trying to quickly sign in or on the move,1i find the app really easy to use and i dont have to worry about using my laptop to schedule payments do quick pay and check my balances if love if the quick pay you have money notifications could be added to the main screen instead of hidden in the hamburger menu which i forget to check,1so you are overseas on a personal or a business trip you realize your card is missing loststolen you open the application hoping to get a phone number for customer support to have your card blocked alas you only get  numbers which are useless at that moment could we add regular callin numbers as wellit would also be helpful to have an instantaneous block card button,1the app has all the functions you would expect and is easy to use but  the security implementation is dumb you can login with finger touch and see your current balances but when you want to make a payment you have to enter your password you already authenticated me with my finger also have to enter a password to see previous statements this is so annoying i typically only use the app to view the balance,1ive never had a problem with this app yet the necessity to enter your password every time is kind of a burden but it makes me feel much more secure with all of my mobile transactions which usually happen on a daily basis i also find it very convenient that i have the ability to check my accounts whenever i want or have need to,1anyone who has been doing online banking for years will quickly know you will not find a better app  and it is constantly being updated and improved with new features  and for those reviewers who dont want to ever have to use passwords for banking save yourself the time and frustration of fraud and theft by sending your money directly to me,1the best thing about this app is that it works with touch id you can also slide to the right for a quick glance at your balance you can very quickly do everything you could do online from a desktop computer including everything from checking your balance paying bills transferring money quick pay and much more ill be sitting in front of my desktop and use my phone for banking as its easier to log in and i can find the functionally of what im looking for so much quicker only a couple of problems it does error sometimes also although im logged in through touch id it still requires a password to move money around in any fashion,1i absolutely love this app i never have a problem with it its so easy to access my information anytime i need i love quick pay and use it all day long my life literally depends on this app and it is  reliable at all times when there is a malfunction im notified once i sign on and that is what a great apps consist of reliability download it you wont be going wrong,1chase is great regardless and this app especially with the touch id is almost too user friendly im not used to it so i sometimes accidentally click cancel instead of using the touch id but its amazing i love being able to pay bills transfer  between accounts and see my credit card and car lease activity all on one screen keep it up,1the application has met every need for my chase account my favorite feature is being able to use chase quick pay overall the app continues to improve and gives me options i didnt even know i would need with mobile banking quickly replacing the desktop version i like that i can see copies of checks on the app,1i love the touch id login and quick view of my account activity the colours red and blue to show debit and credit are really helpful love the app and the user experience it gives me  thoroughly satisfying one thing that could be enhanced is letting more features available on touch login rather than just account summarythis app improves my already great impression about chase as a bank,1what can i say that hasnt been said if you have a chase account and you dont have this app you are living in the bronze age this app is like having a bank in your phone i manage everything with it theyve just added touch login and a quick glance feature that lets you check your balances without logging in at all get the app use the app garry is good garry is wise,1this app is easy to use and clearly displays all the info you need like account numbers balances and the deductions such as interest or purchases and clearly describes where the deductions were made and how much i use it for my car loan and it is extremely easy to understand and i find it great to use and in fact it helps me get ahead by allowing me to pay when i want,0need much improvement  while basic functionality is there any thought into user experience is overlooked  for example you can log into the app with touch id but then it asks for your password for everything else inside the app why use the touch id or just remember that i securely logged into the app already also if anyone wants to pay my bill for me they can have my password why are you asking for it on pay billsthe messages and notifications need improvement also  clunky interface and not easy to use  this could be a good app but is far from it right now,1over the past  years due to family losses ive been called on to use  banks and chase is by far the most professional efficient and responsible by far  years ago under another corporate name they were also the sole bank in atx that would offer a single finance house mortgage to a black family phds no less good history extensive services  stars,1i love this app there really isnt any banking that i need to do that cant be done with this app transfers pay bills etc all work seamlessly and ive never had any issues with it i love the deposit feature it works every time ive used this app for several years and dont plan to change now if they can just figure out how to make it spit out cash it would be complete,1this app functions very well i enjoy having access to my accounts and being able to handle most banking functions my first complaint is regarding the messages they are very hard to navigate to and its virtually a guessing game to figure out which account has the alert my second complaint is that you are unable to search transactions via the app i do love the fingerprint verification capability,1have  chase credit cards and this app makes it easy to check on them i love the alert feature charge made without card present recently while traveling i lost one of my credit cards this app made the reporting and issuing of a new card so easy just a few clicks verify last  charges and had card waiting in my mailbox by the time i got home love it,1this is an excellent app its very easy to use and navigate you can check your balances and activity make payments and deposits and locate atms there is still one complaint push notifications are a hassle to clear most apps seem to have this issue but it becomes a nuisance it shouldnt stop you from getting the app you can turn the notifications off but if you dont just be aware,1the app works well and reads my fingerprint flawlessly however its a little annoying to have to then enter my password anytime i want to see something i know this is a security feature and i appreciate that but it is still annoying i have other accounts that also use fingerprint recognition and do not have to go through the hassle of looking up my password to continue on,1this app is so easy to use the check deposit feature is great however the picture when you log in is really a nice touch but i think it would be great if you could change the photo to any location you wanted for example i live in chicago but love traveling to florida so it would be a nice touch if i could choose the picture at the sign in screen from your whole database of location based photos,1ive been using chase app for years and its one of my mostused apps  i can check my account at anytime by logging in and i can do an easy swipe without logging in just to see my account balance i get notifications based on my settings on withdrawals and deposits so i really dig its a necessity for every chase customer who cares about staying on top of their finances and as well as security,1so i love the app because its very useful handy fast and reliable my only concern is the fingerprint scan sometimes i close the popup window just for a quick view of my account and then decide to login in but i cant figure out how to reopen the fingerprint scan popup to sign in quickly i dont believe theres an option for that so it would be nice to add it like a quick button to reopen the popup,0i have multiple accounts with chase credit works well my mortgage account is a mess with chase nowhere in the app do they tell you when it is due and when you make a payment the login screen never shows youve made the payment but if you go to a different section and dig you can find a payment recordedthese should be the first things you see or care about in an accountalso why do you have to log in twice into the app welcome to the only app in the world it requires you authenticate twice minutes apart from each other,1i have a credit card with chase its the only reason i do business with them and i have to enter my full password every time i want to actually make a payment cmon chase every other big bank out there allows me to pay with touch id get with the times this app is harder to use than the desktop site and thats saying something because it took me five minutes to figure out how to update my phone number there,1this app gives me every feature i would expect with any other bank plus it updates very quickly most of my other banks take  days to show transactions or dont remove pending transactions from the available balance  this app is very intuitive and feature rich   good job chase  now  can you work on fixing the branches    they are horrible,1this is a fantastic banking app almost anything that you would need to go to a branch to do can be done with this application my favorite features are the adoption of touchid throughout the app and the ability to deposit checks remotely each release seems to add more features without adding complexity this is a great app and it only seems to be getting better,1the chase app is a lifesaver for me ive become so paranoid about fraudulent activity i do not give my account or debit card information to anyone it gives me such peace of mind to be able to pay my bills electronically and never have to provide my bank info to pay the rent and deposit my checks without ever subjecting my card to atm card lifters very very pleased with the app,1with touch logon enabled it makes it easy to sign in user interface is clean and simple giving me access to the things i need to do my online banking the deposit feature is much more reliable than it used to be i gave it four stars only because i would like an easier way to read and address alerts from the main screen rather than go they the side menu navigation,1i actually prefer to use this app on my iphone rather than ipad  the finger print recognition feature keeps being removed on the ipad so i have to go thru a multi step process to reestablish it and more frustrating the ipad version will not open in landscape view sometimes its the little things that count other than that the app is fine and i have used it on my iphone for a number of years now,1very efficient and user friendly i use it daily for checking balances and often for other transactions the only thing i wish was different was that when i accept a chase quick pay the decline payment button was a little further away from the accept button im always worried my big thumbs will decline an important payment,1i use this app all the time i love being able to change my alert settings its easy to read my account activity and i deposit checks to my account using the app all the time its really a life saver i also like being able to check out my bill pay on my phone so i can change my payments or look up payment history without having to be by a computer,1working with chase has already been very easy and the app just makes the experience even better it does suffer occasional bugs where it freezes think that was fixed in last update but the access to history and especially the ease of quickpay are what i compliment this app most for  im only giving it  stars so theres room for improvement  keep up the good work chase,1nice and easy shows my account info quick and easy lots of security options shows deposits and withdrawals and purchases so its easy to follow easy to keep track of where the money is going i can make alerts whenever money is drawn that way in case i realize my card is lost i know immediately very convenient and easier to use than some games even,1ive been using this app for several years initially for added security control but after the occasional updates it seems the developers keep improving navigation and simplifying our tasks thankfully theyve never strayed far from the original concept so the learning curve has always been quite easyi only do online bankingso last but not least is the excellent customer service,0great idea poorly executed the idea of a trimmed  down mobile app for iphoneipad makes perfect sense chase is an old school bank that wont eg log stuff on the weekend presumably because the senior staff is on the golf course so nothing can happen in their absenceif you make deposits on friday after  pm they are not posted until monday at am like thati hear it is because all the real banking is still done by huge old mainframes rather than sleek powerful mini or mac power stations talk about feeding the dinosaursthe additional specific is the alert feature it notifying you of an alert but not what the alert is dessert for dinosaursget with it chase,1absolutely love this app im able to check my accounts schedule my credit card payments deposit my checks and use quick pay at any given moment of the day dont think i could live without it definitely a benefactor of banking with chase since they always seem to keep up with the growing use of technology,1this app gets the job done for credit card user its a good way to keep track of my credit card usage i use the app frequently to see whats being charged to the card it has helped me to immediately report mistakes and concerns a lot sooner than waiting for the monthly statement i also like that i can see the monthly statements if i need to,1the app is honestly in my opinion the best app you can get without having to do too much its got touch id so you can log in with your finger its really organized and pretty detailed its got a help section in case you dont know something only i dont like is the fact that it will say pending so unless your really keeping track of your transactions you can get confused pretty easily,1love the online banking and payment options only one negative when making a payment i wish the decimal point would automatically be there instead of putting it in ourselves i also have bank of america and do like the usage of the decimal point you just type in the numbers and it keeps pushing them forward depending on dollar amount,1ive been with chase for more than  years checking and credit cardsthe app works well and is easy to understand for everything you need to do with two small exceptionsi dont see a way to dispute a credit card transaction on the app  i need to open my laptop and search for  minutes to find a tiny hidden button to dispute anything  this shouldnt be that difficult to addalso depositing a check on your phone is great although i am finding i need to take the picture  or  times before it accepts it  as a comparison boa a bank i dislike has an app that just tells you when its focused well and takes the photo for you it is much easier  something to think about for your next update,1first things first this app works perfectly well allows me to do  of my frequent usage without needing the websitenow for some feature requests i see nothing except transaction history in all my accounts i would like to be able to access some of my account details even if its behind a proper password lock the secure message center +  emails on every time i pay off my cards off is a bit annoying one email would suffice i would thinkoverall chase provides great service the app is very convenient i have both chase and bofa the bofa app just edges it in usability but chase has significantly better products especially credit cards,1my original review is belowspectacular appchase listened and touch id now allows you to actually use the app now great job chase teameverything about the app is great except touch idtheres no point in using touch id if you have to enter your password every time in order to do anything my brokerage app uses touch id flawlessly and i never have to type my password please fix touch id chaseall or nothing i dont want to have to enter my password if touch id is a feature everif someone has your phone and your worried about them enabling fingerprint and using touch id with the app you deserve it you already gave them your apple id to enable touch fingerprint whats it matter after that,1i love this app not only because it makes it super easy to access all my chase accounts in one place at anytime but also because of its ease of operation its very simple to use and never gives me any trouble with anything i also love the style of the app its very streamlined and minimalistic which is refreshing to look at  would recommend,1ive been a chase bank customer for several years now and have used the app all the time it is super easy and convenient i can deposit money from anywhere at anytime gone through several banks in the past with problem after problem chase is the first bank ive had no issues with including the app,1my spouse uses a different bank and app and their site is often down for a few years i lived out of a chase bank area and thought of moving banks but after looking at other online options i realized that chase was the best option for me i love it i also use their credit card system app for accepting cards for my business,1compared to other banking apps i utilize this app is very easy to navigate and is responsive i do have to note i only use it for the credit card payment and management functionality now as i have transferred my checking account to another banking institution not because of anything chase did or did not do but again it works very well for what i need,1when this new ap was released it seemed to be missing a few old features that i found usefulthey were not missing but not as easy to find as they once were as i pondered writing to chase about how difficult they were to find and navigate to one by one they started to reappear in more prominent places now all i have to write is this sparkling review,1i have been using the chase app for five years on several generations of iphone and i have never had any problems the main things i do are transfer money deposit checks and pay my credit card the check deposit feature is especially handy as it saves a trip to the bank keep up the great work,1when i  got the app i needed it for online payments and banking however when i downloaded it it was very confusing to navigate in fact i couldnt even set up online billing through the app which was a little irritating i had to go through the website to set it up making me go out of my way i digressed once i had everything set up the way i wanted it was very easy to use and navigate  stars,1the application through my iphone is very easy to use very userfriendly can receive all information needed pay bills and so much more dont know what i would do without it i give the chase application  starsthe only problem is once you write a review it keeps asking even though it is completed its a little annoying,1cant complain about the app it works perfectly for me helps me do everything i need to do quick and easy deposit checks quickpay transfer money between accounts set up reminders etc i really like to feel of knowing that everything i usually do by calling a chase rep can be taken care of through the site without the wait ,1pretty good for the most part fingerprint verification would be great it used to have it but for some reason its not available any longer deposit via phone is nice but it needs some help since the update it doesnt work every time your team needs to test things a lot more efficiently before updating dont fix it if its not broke which seems to be the problem it worked great until you fixed it,1i love the touch id feature on just about everything i have except for chase lately its been randomly shutting the feature off and when i type in my password im immediately locked out of my account its incredibly frustrating especially since passwords now require your firstborn child and the blood of a virgin ive had to change my password so many times now that i no longer remember it  minutes after i choose it so annoying,1this app is probably the best it has been its easy to navigate and works consistently no frills and straightforward like finance ought to be i docked a star because the messaging is a little wonky every time i go to empty those out it seems like it is taking longer than it ought for something simple the app prompts me to rate it often too which is annoying im taking the slim chance that finally rating it will make it back off ,1this app is the greatest thing for me because there are no chase locations near me so it makes it so easy to do my banking via the app plus im disabled so its even better for me for that reason alone they do not charge for any deposit fees like other banks do and ive been with chase since  and refuse to change banks  the new update makes it even better then before i love it more then ever,1i love love love love love this app it is so easy to use and has a lot of cool features like mobile check depositing i really appreciate how fast it is too i opened a savings account yesterday at like  and it was already on the app by about  i will deposit a check on the app and it will be in my account within an hour its awesome chase is just an awesome banki would recommend it to everyone,1i dont use the app a lot because its a little difficult to get around the organization and layout are not very intuitive the touchid is definitely buggy it disappears sometimes like it was never set up you must login manually and reset up the touchid feature i do some basic account balance checking transferring of money and quickpay these things work ok if youre need more youll probably be disappointed im hoping chase will hear the feedback and make some changes,1we like the app it has a nice clean interface its very easy to check our balance and access the app with touch id  having this app eliminates the need to access the website as the most useful transactions and alerts can be managed within the app we also use this app to transfer allowance to our children which is very convenient,1for years now i use the mobile app both for my phone and my ipad sometimes the apps have limited use for maintenance but as someone who works in the pci compliancy world i like that the only negative thing i could see is that they annoy you for reviews regularly like all other apps im hoping writing this makes that go away forever anyone who banks with chase should use the app,1i use this app for all my money needs i hardly ever carry cash so i dont usually every need an atm this app allows me to pay my freedom card and view all my transactions on both accounts its easy to log in and maneuver through it with ease i can even deposit my checks through it and it deposits them the next day or even the same day if done early i love it,1this app is so convenient i can see exactly everything i need to know about my account and i can also deposit my checks the minute i get them most of the time the only complaint i have is that quick deposit doesnt always work or recognize the handwritten numbers but thats not a huge deal its only happened once or twice great app,0typical chasethe app doesnt have the newest most helpful functions such as viewing your last few creditdebit transactions without the hassle of logging in  see the citibank app to understand what progressive banks are doing digitally  why do i say typical chase  i stopped using their online bill payment system because they do not accept ebills on my behalf from merchants etc  this is unlike  of the banks in the country even tiny community banks offer this i guess its too much of an inconvenience for chase so like united airlines they do whats easiest for themselves and not whats best for their customers,1basic info and functionality is good  i appreciate the interest in safety but the app doesnt remember me  i consistently use a couple of devices  with that constant use those devices should eventually become trusted but thats not the case  i constantly need to receive text messages to simply login  plus the touch id on preference must repeatedly be set  if the app is inconvenient it defeats the purpose of having it at all,1can do almost all my banking on this deposit checks check balances etc the notification section is a little annoying and cumbersome you get a notification and have to go all the way through to the individual notification to make the red dot disappear would rather it just gave you an option when signing in to delete or lock further etc,1love this app it saves me so much time and hassle paying vendors depositing checks transfers bill pay all functions work well and for the most part are intuitive my only complaint is quickpay does not seem to allow transfers by phone number or im just not understanding how to do it i highly recommend chase bank and their mobile app,1the closest chase bank is about  minutes away and they are closed by the time i get off work i wish we had the ability to edit how we pay our credit cards from the app and the ability to pay using a debit card i receive my paycheck via debit card and i cant make my payments this is very inconvenient for me,0notifications needs redone when i click on the notification it should take me to the chase app and highlight the notification right now when it takes me to app that all it does and when i go to my accounts i have trouble finding it and when i find it then exit the app i forgot and have to go back to the app to view alerts to get rid of the notification badge icon when i view the alerts they are all bunched together and they are all together with iphone text and email please make it more clear and easier,0this app worked great for years now occasionally i when i login the app will say i need to enable touch id now i must enter my password no big problem but the first time i enter my password i get the message too many attempts and i must change my password this is happening far to many times recently it get to be a real pain to keep changing my passwordedit reduce to one star i use many banking apps this is the only app that make me reset my password im not the only user complaining about this is chase to lazy or just simply inept in their ability to correct the problem with their app,1very easy to use scheduling payments and checking accounts but id like to suggest an improvement when you schedule a payment well in advance and then we come within the alert time let me know i have already scheduled a payment your payment is due in  days  you currently have a payment scheduled to process in  days login with your chase mobile app for details,1while this app will not stop asking for me to leave a review i will not hold that against it this app has saved my financial life many a time and i fully appreciate that i really like being able to check in at any time to see my balance and quick pay us a godsend keep up the great work chase it is why i have used this bank for so long,0i have been using the chase mobile app ever since become available and have always enjoyed using it very easy to navigate and userfriendly i am in business so i have quite a few checks that i deposited every month and never had issues until now the day i did the update about  weeks ago it immediately started crashing on me and i have not been able to get it to work correctly ever since i called chase they refreshed my account and i deleted and reinstalled the app its still not working right hoping a fix is released soon,1the app is perfect i can do most of my banking on the go no need to stop to a branch most of the time transfer payments deposits live the quick pay even current offers i can see on it as anything sometimes is down for maintenance i would not change my rating new update doesnt allow me to include special characters on my notes when i do a transfer or pmt ,1chase mobile is easy to use and very convenient i love that i can send and receive money from people within seconds a transaction shows as soon as its made and the quick email notifications and alerts are always helpful i highly recommend using this app if you bank with chase and if you dont what are you waiting for,0does not support a couple which has multiple chase accounts some in ones name some in the others name  requires signoffsignon to get to all accounts  does not support notifications for both  this app and web access should allow a couple who has credit in both names to manage all family accounts with one access if desired  in many families one spouse manages the card payments even if credit is in both names  many families are no longer sexist and have credit in only the husbands name as in my parents generation  chase get with the times,1i love this app i use it all the time i use just about every feature it has from quick pay to transferring money to paying my credit card so convenient if i had one gripe its that my credit score is not viewable on one of the menu drop down tabs they have credit journey but it opens a separate tab and takes you to another page that i do not like but everything else has been great so far,1this app is very user friendly and makes banking with chase a stressfree experience the app is very intuitive and makes it almost unnecessary to go to a branch the only down side is that they have regular app maintenance that makes some functions inaccessible but that is usually over the weekend and they already have notices letting you know when it will happen,1i really love having this app i honestly cant imagine not having it it makes it so easy to check my balance transfer money etc everything is so convenient and user friendly i feel like its very intuitive to find whatever youre looking to see or do on this app each version they keep improving it for usthanks chase i love it,1does what i need but the only thing that i can think of that would improve it for me is it would help to show current months balance and invoice balance i budget month to month and pay invoice in full but i have to subtract involve balance from total balance to see what i have spent this current month it would be easier to track my spending,1overall a very useful app i use  or  times a weekmy main issue with the app isbeing unable to write a message in their secure message areai can read messages but can not start a message from my phone i use my phone for of my  online banking so for me its a major issue i have voiced my  concern many times i find it hard to believe that a bank as large as this cannot set up a messaging system  that works from a smart phone,1i was hoping to use this app to make quick mortgage payments online like i do from chases website   the website lets you set up external accounts you can use to transfer funds but the app only allows you to transfer funds between your chase accounts i only have a mortgage through chase so this doesnt really serve the purpose youd think it would   if it would allow external transfers it would get another star from me as of now its barely ,1i love this app i rarely find the need to go on the chase website only to change settings get more details ect this app is built for day to day tasks like checking balances monitoring transactions and basic bill pay it dose all of these things and more very well if you need to do something uber complicated thats what the website is for and dont forget about your local branch,1love this app use it all the time and can even use it to deposit checks now from your iphone i would give it  stars but the last  days its not been logging in because there servers is messing up or there updating or something i have no idea and they have not released why its doing this hope they fix it soon because its annoying but it use to work everytime without problems before this started,0downloaded the latest update which said it made improvements to the check deposit feature this feature used to always work for me now it always says the picture is not clear enough also even though i properly frame the check when it appears on the deposit screen all this unnecessary background is included around the check  it no longer converts the check to black and white which in my opinion greatly improved the clarity please fix this feature,1it works really great i use it to check both my checking and savings account i can also add alert limits that will tell me when i have made really expensive transactions you will find a really great use for this app it has helped me keep track of how i spend and save my money the new update is a plus because it tells you your savings withdraw limit,1i love the fact that i can deposit checks just by taking a picture of them i have done this several times with no problems except for one that was more than the limit the only change i would request is that the atm locator include a map for when you arent familiar with the streets around you or which direction to head in to a particular address,0when i first had this app it was great i have never had an issue until now they changed some things on the app and now it is much harder to reconcile your checkbook with your account because nothing is up to date on this app put a deposit through that never made the deposit into my account even though chase sent an email saying they did indeed accept my money called for customer support and revived no help and just a bunch of excuses as to why there stupid doesnt work anymore if you use this app dont trust it completely because it will let you down,1the app is very good but only one slight problem im unable to see the checks images after i deposited them i want to be able to click on it and see the picture of the check but as for the cash the could be a great feature as well so when you click on it you see whether you deposited or withdrew  or s but i do have to nice update to your recent branches in new jersey that just opened i love its new sleek open feel,1ive got several accounts through chase checking savings and credit i love how easy it is to manage my accounts on the go i have moved away from a chase branch and this app helps do the things id do inside a branch chase has paved the standard for how mobile banking should be there are a lot of banks that fall short additionally it is very user friendly and i love the sleek design,1i use this app pretty much every other day to check my balances deposit checks and to transfer money its easy to use an i rely on this app consistently so far i havent had a complaint and ive had this app for a good two and a half years i will say it has made a lot of improvements since then i highly recommend this to all chase members,1i was surprised how fast a transaction can get through i was standing in front of the cashier using my chase debit card when my card wouldnt go through my grocery bill had gone over my balance grabbed the phone opened the app and transferred some in it took less than  seconds and my card went through saved me a lot of embarrassment,1the app is easy to use cuts right to the chase and is always quick to notify me of any transaction over a specific amount which helps in times when a bill payment charge goes through i have proof that i paid and i have the comfort of knowing they received the money without error it tells me my balance in a text each morning and is like my own personal accountant lt,0i love the concept of innovative services of being able to scan a check for deposit  unfortunately that is where any promise of the app endslack of support for touch id and iphone  and  plus is inexplicable and the notification system is plain horrendous  do the app designers or the product manager ever us the app to understand how grotesquely cumbersome it is to clear even a notification there are some insightful constructive reviews and hope the app is made to keep up with the promise of innovations like mobile check deposit,1i do all my banking electronically on my phone chase has done an outstanding job of building in all the functionality one could ask for in their mobile app my only request of them is not necessarily related to the app and that is to remove the  limit for quick pay and to not make the hold so long for incoming payments from non chase payees,1chase just gets better and better i love the touch screen i thought you couldnt do any better after the you added the preview screen but the finger print to open the app tops them all after viewing the preview i would have to log in to do anything else but now voila just touch and you can complete anything else you need to do  good job team chase,1i like the app very happy about the improvements wish the type was a little darker kind of hard for old eyes to see  wish the message center worked better always tells me i have messages but when i go into it i dont see any and then maybe a couple of days later theyll show up kind of frustrating  right now it tells me i have  messages but when i go into the app its blank fix the secure message center,1this app was great until the last update when for some reason they took away account summaries for credit cards now whatever you tap you get transaction history not helpful i want to quickly and easily see my balance amount due and due date i know this is in the swipe from login screen but if i want to make a payment or something i have to log in anyway definitely lost functionality with this update,1love this app i dont know what i would do without the ability to just touch the button on my iphone and have my fingerprint open my account it makes life soooo simple con  they need to add a recurring pay option having to remember every month the pay my bills blows compared to my other banks app otherwise this app would be off the charts dont get me wrong its sick as is,1i use this app everyday to check balances transfer funds and deposit checks i like the fact that you need to enter your password if you choose to perform a financial transaction its added security i do wish that the checks transaction details and deposit statements were viewable from the app i feel its very user friendly and easy to use,1i downgraded my previous rating from  stars to  i dont like the function on still having to login using touch id for more functionality i should have the ability to use it either by password or touch id to get the same access all other apps do i dont have the ability to transfer to my ira from an account or from a liquidity account to another account  can basically do most of my banking from my phone or tablet i do like the ability to make make deposits,1of the three banking institutions i use all of which have mobile applications the chase app is the best hands down  fast uptodate account information is available in a gui that couldnt be easier on the eyes  local information on atms and branches is also available and has always been accurate  this app tops it all with touch id functionally the best addition yet,1i love being able to deposit checks or send people money without ever stepping foot in a bank  swiping to see my balance is nice too once tried to send all my bank balance in my checking account to someone and it wouldnt let me so there are hidden rules even customer service representatives couldnt tell me  so plan to always have a couple bucks in your accounts would love to see money management charts graphs goals,1was or could still be the number  prime bank in the world lets start off with that because that shows how much money they have and willing to spend on apps i generally trust chase with all my finances i have yet to have an issue with the app that is constant and time consuming usually it works seamlessly with touch id amp has a smooth interface great app i would recommend it ,1love this chase app super fluid and speedy touch id enabled push notifications and the ability to call any department at chase through the app everything you could want in a banking app in this age of technology wish other major banks would get on chases level here to stay on my iphone and cant wait to see what other exciting features the future will bring,1until this update oct  i believe chase decided to add an additional password to several functions or menu options its time consuming and ridiculous that this option is there makes me not want to use the app add the touchid feature inside of the app since the touchid feature is used to access the app why not do it again inside the app make this happen please i wont use this app until the password feature is fixed with touchid or removed,1love the app  however an alert comes through and if you have several accounts you have to check each one to figure out the alert i wish this could be made easieri also loved the swipe feature to see account balances but lost that when i changed phones and cant seem to get it back its a great app for me and my business,1i love it  i get my alerts on all of my accounts and can check and transfer money as well as pay bills very easily  its really easy to use  i would make one tweek  i would put the number of the alert next to the account so that i know which one its for instead of going through each account to check which one it was for,1chases latest app is easily accessible and userfriendly thus far i havent experienced any major bugs or malfunctions while looking up my bank account further more  i have been able to make payments transfer money and complete any other transactions all on my phone however theres always room for improvement,1the chase mobile app is a very handy little app that i find myself using ever more frequently  i especially like the ability to make a check deposit with my phoneits saved me from several trips to the bank  i can imagine a few improvements  but i expect the will figure them out soon enough as ive already seen some in recent updates  all around great job so far,1this app makes banking seamless cant tell you how much time saved and convenience this app has afforded my life i use it to check transactions balances move money send money and deposit money also chases quick pay has made my familys financial transfers to our college aged children incredibly easy i love the layout colors etc  so clean and clutter free,1convenient and easy this app saved me a few times from detecting fraudulent charges almost as soon as they happened also makes timely payments easy when i am not next to a computer or bank branch i have yet to explore all of its features but even for the most basic functions it is worth having definitely recommend it,0i will never update the ios on my s its over  years old and i have not had any problems hmmm maybe because ive never updated the ios if somethings not broke dont fix it however chase just made their app require ios so now i cant use it luckily the website version still does everything except for check deposits this really bothered me i will continue to delete apps once they require a ios update because id rather have my expensive phone in  work than have the latest bug fix on any app,1have the app since it was offered i use it mainly to check deposits to see if checks cleared and confirm balance im able to look at both my business and personal accounts no need to visit branches unless im doing a wire transfer or some special transaction cant believe we used to visit branches for everything,1i love my chase mobile banking i can do all my banking here quickly and hassle free all the many features work great and they are constantly thinking of new ways to improve both look and function my favorites are the simple and fast transfers between accounts snapshot check deposits and the new touch id login way to go chase you are my bank,1overall this is a solid app my major complaint is the inconsistency in requiring the passcode or fingerprint login i have found that if i log off every time i can usually get it to prompt the fingerprint on opening but not always it may seem nitpicky but there are many apps that handle their login process better other than that its an app that i have no qualms about using routinely through the day,1it makes paying bills so easy i love this app i do hope that it will incorporate some features such as showing me my monthly spending and incomes each month and showing me my spending in categories i have to use other app for that reason but i would rather chase app has that feature so it would be easier and i think it will be safer as well,1all in all this is a great app however as more devices have touch id the current implementation of account preview is useless to the extent i forgot it existed upon opening the app you are prompted to enter your fingerprint to view account preview your have  to cancel login then swipeif account preview is turned on i think that is the first screen a user should see when opening the app they can then swipe to login,1great app userfriendly clear interface big problem is the  monthly limit for online photo check deposit found this out the hard way when i was out of town and states away from a chase branch customer service was unable todeclined to even temporarily increase my monthly deposit limit resulting in my becoming overdrawn for several days until i was back in range grrrr that issue needs a fix otherwise convenient and works well,1works very well deposits from other accounts or mobile photo of check deposit is simple amp easy quick pay for other deposits to me worked very well documentation for checks or auto payments works well chase always applies deposits before debits so no penalties for overdraftsother banks dont do this chase app works extremely well on any device,1i love the fact that you can just swipe over to see a preview of whats in your account instead of signing in its super easy to use chase quickpay and to navigate through the app i also love the fact that you know when you have messages the only thing i dont like is that chase doesnt have their app for all devices eg kindle which has the google playstore it makes no sense to me but other than thatfantastic app,0this used to be the best banking app there was i love the features it has its at a standstill id love to see them add support for force touch on iphone s or add a watch app id also like to see simple fixed such as when turning preview on and swiping to see it when you swipe back being able to use touch id again also having updated balance previews with pending transactions not just the main balance with those taken in to account also the ability to delete messages in the secure message center easier and quicker,1adding fingerprint id was brilliant but to do anything other than view balances user must input password too invalidating the use of the fingerprint id   the app also has limited usesusers cannot change payment amount on chase credit card full or minimum payment each month  there are definite limitations to the app but its great for checking account balances or transferring funds between accounts,1i like this app its convenient but when you deposit cash into the atm before pm and it takes till the end of the following day or longer to show up then you use the app to deposit a check also before pm and it takes through the following day till the next morning to show up that is not convenient when at any time that next day i could have brought the check in and it wouldve been in my acct in minutes thanks chase app,1the best feature of this app is the notifications sent to your phone when a charge is made to the card it is important to me to be able to monitor activity on the credit card other features of the app are easy to access and use it allows me to have timely information for the credit card,1i like most of the features love the customer service however there is one issue i have with the alerts  the app will tell you there is an alert for an account that needs attention however with several accounts it does not indicate for which account the alert is for  you have to tap on each account individually to find the appropriate alert seems like it should be easily identifiable,1im not usually a very techs person but this app has been invaluable the quick pay options and bill pay options are amazing i used to always double check and triple check to make sure bills were paidnow i dont have to its as easy as texting someone as it is to pay themi highly recommend this,1app functions very well but often times will crash while logging in due to low network connectivity ive had a claim denied because apparently ive logged in a couple times between an unauthorized transaction and when i called to report it when in truth the app crashed a couple times and balances werent shown the developer has a lot of work to do especially since the bank makes decisions on claims and such using the data thats reported from the app,0compared to other phone apps this one seems to be the most outdated the login is a pain especially if your touch id doesnt read when you want to make a payment you have to enter your password unless you enter your password when you first login instead of using the touch idyou cant see your rewards as easily as other apps you have to click a link that takes you to your rewards i love the heavy credit card i just wish the app was better capital one has a great app they are just lacking the thick card,1im fairly new to chase but so far ive found this app to be perfect for basic onthego needs very accessible and easytonavigate interface particularly fantastic when i just want to monitor a transaction and know exactly when it goes through have not yet tried more complicated operations but i see no reason they would not work,0i have four accounts with chase i generally have no issues with your ux on either mobile or web but x in the last three weeks ive had to update my password because your app suddenly determined on its own that touch id has been toggled off so i put in my password and of course its not recognized after  gd try then it locks me out and forces me to update my password online fricken times in  weeks  just to see my account balances i dont need to put up with thistoo many other banks offer comparable locations and services fix your app or lose a customer,1im biased by my wells fargo app the chase app is not as easy to use and limited in what i can do much more than the wells fargo app i just logged on to check balances and view alerts and secure messages  which it said i have   the screen was blank i went to other places and the site seemed to be working i went back to messages and again it was blank i tried several more times with the same result this kind of thing i have come to expect from this app im very disappointed,1i like the fact that when you log on you are provided the realtime account balance versus the delay you receive at the atm another useful feature is the capability to transfer money from one chase account to another for example savings to checking plus the app is very easy to usenavigate,1the app is very good   still annoying thing is that typing suggestions or spelling corrections offered by iphone  ipad are not propagated if touched on the memos area of transactions  for example  if i start typing ap  the iphone or ipad will suggest april however if i touch the suggestion april it does not affect what i typed and i will have to correct it manually to aprilalso santander bank app check deposit picture taking is automatic in framing the check chase should adapt that feature into their app,1ive been using this app for over  months it has been great for most of that time easy to use for deposits account balance etc however this past month maybe since the july app update it would not open and would not respond even when i tried to delete it i finally figured out a different way to delete and then reinstalled it works well again,1ive been using this chase app about years by now the app is the most convenience and reliable to use above all the chase quick pay service is the best creative i can easily transfer money within our friendswho are also have chase account and once we accept that transaction the money can be use right away i love it the best,1everything works good i can deposit my check with my phone check my balance and use chase quick pay to pay other people fast i also like the bill pay option to pay my all my bills with it  i wish i can check my fico score on my mobile app that would be perfect,1this app works well but i wish it had features like capital ones app namely an easier interface for people with multiple cards once i set up some scanning on capital ones i have access to for credit cards quick easy payment with this chase app every single time i have to verify who i am with a pin  sent to my text or email it is incredibly annoying so whoever wrote this app download capital ones  study it that has one of the easiest quickest interfaces i have ever used,1clean spare interface loads fast and is comprehensive you can see check images schedule bill payments and pay credit cards one improvement would be to display the name of the recipient of a check by automatically reading it through ocr it will also make it easier to use third party budgeting software easier,1i like this app because its very easy to use and the information that is provided gives me a good status at a glance also since stores are getting into the green habit of not printing a receipt after a purchase unless you ask its very easy for me to bring up this app and check to see what they really charged me,0this app was great until the last update you could use print id on iphone but that option is no longer available the look of the user interface is nice but some of the features are not as nice as before more clicks and app crashes frequently would have been better as it was it was more stablein that update some settings were changed and to reactivate touch id you have to go into the settings the update should not have changed this and just creates an unnecessary annoyance,1just an allaround perfect app its easy to use effective and really helpful my favorite part are the onapp check deposits without mentioning the account preview which saves you time of you just want to check your balance its just a really great app definitely recommend it if you bank with chase you just have to have it,1let me start by saying yes there is always a way it can be improved that said i have no real complaints or issues with the app every update seems to be an attempt at making things better and there is never a long period of time when the app is not functional basically it could definitely be worse,1may  update the rate us in the app store prompt supersedes the touch id prompt if you tap no thanks the only login option is to type your password if you say never you can kill the app relaunch it and then use touchid to log in consider moving the rate us prompt to after login so it does not interfere with touch id logins otherwise add a touch id button to bring up the login prompt manually or have the log on button open the touch id for chase window whenever the password field is blank __________my only suggestion thus far would be to allow the text size of the available balance to respond to the text size setting of ios  it is quite large by default and i dont need the gentleman next to me on the train knowing my available funds my privacy screen protector can only conceal so muchiphone s ios ,1ive have been a chase customer since day   and they have always protected my accounts i had fraud on my account and they took care of all of the problems quickly i love the app its the best i watch others have issues with their bank apps and im so happy thats not me keep up the great work chase i love the finger touch to open my app quickly its so convenient,1this is wonderful app transaction updates are instant you walk out of the bank and in real time everything is updated finding a branch based on where you are is a breeze very very easy to use now this exiting new feature of photographing your checks and sending electronically is a wonderful new feature certainly love this app keep it up,1chase app saves you time and easy to use theres a setting that gives you a quick overview of your accounts balances his helps in keeping you informed when youre not sure of your balances quickly you can do a lot on the run and when traveling helps you find the nearest chase bank very useful and easy to use,1similar to other users comments this app is stable and works smoothly in all scenarios  its clearly built in house amp thoroughly tested prelaunchive never seen a bug even in some of the more complex features like the camera scan of checks  thanks for keeping your app functional amp not sending to  contractors amp subcontractors in some shack offshore to get it done  works awesome,1i use to love the new thumb print but ever since i updated my phone for some reason i cant do it anymore its like taking away a convenience i dont know if the app has to catch up with an update or not other than the i love the new quick pay feature i never miss a quick pay now its dependable and i love having it literally at my finger tips,1this app is amazing i use the app to make payments on both of my chase credit cards the app is also great for monitoring your accounts and any activity both authorized and unauthorized so yes i would definitely recommend this app however i wouldnt recommend any chase credit cards andthis is coming from someone with good credit and a great payment history,1this app is perfect it always works and i never have real troubles with it i absolutely love chase bank i just wished they would build more around like they do other banks such as wells fargo and bank of america both of those banks are incompetent and take your money btw i love chase because they are so convenient and will work with you i plan to stay with them for a very long time ,1this app works pretty well and better than their previous problems with the touch id are still have resurfaced issue with the mobile deposit not functioning half the time wish i could see transaction details the details about available credit and available bank account balance are awkward and confusing to usethe way it was before was better,1in december  i write two years ago i wrote after  years the chase app is still great  back then i postedive never had any problem with the app or with chase for that manner i deposit withdraw transfer do all my banking from my iphone since i live  miles out in the country chase has been a life  and fuel  saver what would i do without it  stop banking  probably,1theres a lot to like about the chase app these days touchid support better performance and check deposits with higher limits although itd be nice if the volume button fired the camera so i dont have to shake the phone by tapping the screeneven the secure message center previously my biggest source of confusion seems to have gotten more rational lately nice work team,1great app easy to navigate and to accomplish transactions without much hassle its easy to deposit checks for the most part although once in a while theres a glitch with it reading the checks i recommend it for any chase account holders for easy access to their account and for realtime transaction history,1ive been using the app for almost everything deposit pay bill checking my balance since i downloaded the app i could count how many times i went to bank  or  in a year it is very convenient to me but the only thing i would suggest is whenever we pay the bill i would like to see how our outstanding balance goes down immediately like citibank app,1this app is amazing i travel a lot but i can always check my account anywhere very dependable for all account information makes my life easy while i travel i dont have to wait for the snail mail statements to make a payment check the app for the balance then make payment with online banking i highly recommend this app so i give it a five star rating,1unlike so many i have no petty complaints about little imperfections because this app makes life so much more convenient than having to go to the bank or even go home and get on the computer to find out this personal information about my bank account so thank you whoever spent the energy and time and expense to provide this for us,0hate hate hate this app so much been using iphones since  and have never written a review for any apps turns off the touch id after every update so naturally i try to log on by typing in my password nope never takes it tells me i have to reset my password then you go through the big hassle of doing so and that doesnt work either no matter what combination of letters and numbers you choose the only way i can reset it and gain access to my account through this piece of garbage app is to change my password using my laptop truly amateur hour all these programmers need to be fired asap,1ive been with this bank for a long time way before smartphones and apps were invented but this app defines truly what easy online banking is i can check my accounts and deposit checks right on my fingertips with the fingerprint sign in makes it more user friendly and you dont have to type in your password each time,1the app is very user intuitive the interface is fast and easy to master the app provides everything you need for a complete banking experience the check depositing feature works much better but make sure the check is clean as if it is smudged the app will get confused and it will not read the check overall the app is very visually pleasing,1its perfect having the ability to access not only different accounts but being able to look at all transactions on all credit cards your free credit score rewards points and offers and also being able to deposit checks this app has it all,1prosgood design slick clean interfacei really like the local rotating photography wallpaper fast efficient easy to useseems more cutting edge than other banks conswishlistthe new inapp ads are annoying can i shut them off or dismiss it once ive seen it and have it remembercould use more push alerts options wells fargo has excellent alertsit would be nice to have a built in spendingbudget tool like mint or wells fargo money map i think bofa has this now too this feature alone that would make me switch over  of my banking business to chase i need to see where my money goes and having it built into chase would be money it would be nice to see account and touting number in the appthanks chase,1i wish there was a way with this app and online with chase to mark which transactions you have wrote down in your ledger  sometimes you cannot balance because of a transaction has taken several days to go through and going back and finding it can be a hassle ive tried talking to chase before about this and there is never any help we have a credit union that  at this option with their online banking about  years ago,1all things considering this isnt a bad app except when i try to deposit a check by taking a picture of it i try different lighting and backgrounds as they suggested with higher contrast and even mounted it on a tripod for zero camera movement nothing seems to work someone told me i need to use plain bright checks no patterns so ill have to see if that works btw i never had this problem with us banks app but chase has always been a better bank for me,1ive been using this app for over a year and it has worked very well it was intuitive to start and has been consistent since it times out if i am inactive once logged in and does not show my personal information when it is one of multiple tabs being previewed on my phone i appreciate these features,1the app has always been useable and decent every time it changes it gets better and worse better in that some functionality is added and worse in that existing functionality temporarily disappears then reappears it feels like the attention to detail in the coding process is a bit lacking so take a version or two and really polish what youve got and i think youll have a solid hit that is a pleasure to use and absolutely bullet proof,1best banking application period i started banking with them and remain banking with them just because of how useful the app is the only thing thats missing for now is cardless atm access but im confident theyre already working on it the app has never crashed on me its smooth and functional chase is ahead of the game with this,1this app is so amazing that i can monitor all my transaction my current balances and my automatic deposits at anytimeit show you the history of every purchase and adjustment that i been made the chase bank however is a good bank to trust bank will alert you for all over amount transaction that is occurring i love the app and i recommend it to all chase members,0update chase needs to add a running balance to know what my balance will be once pending transactions are done also very often ill have one balance in my account and later in the day ill have more money then i had before only to lose more due to pending transactions frustrating chases poorly designed mobile site makes this app an annoyance to use does what its supposed to do but wamus mobile site was a lot better and account information was more detailed chase at least look at wamus former site and improve yours,1i just moved to missouri and was planning to move my account from chase to a local bank because there are no chase branches here my worry was not being able to deposit checks i just seen the commercial for the quick deposit and tried it out with a  rebate check ive been carrying  around it worked great they just saved a long time costumer from going elsewhere i just wish the daily maxine deposits was more then ,1i said i would rerate this app after they opened up the quick deposit feature for the ipod touch g now that they have its definitely worth  stars to me as i dont have an iphone thanks for listening to your customers chase its quite a concept in this day and ageupdate depositing does not work in the slightest another fail  starsupdate  they fixed it back to five,1this is a great app while i havent used apps for other banks chase has some very useful features like bill pay send money to individuals like paypal amp check deposits via phone this is way cool its so easy to do amp the transaction is completed rapidly the app is stable amp havent experienced any connection issues i appreciate that the app is free amp are no additional service fees for using the appcheers ,1most of my banking i do from my mac credit card payments are all automatic so i dont need much from an app except to check on recent transactions and to see my balance in each account also to see when payments are due so i can enter them in my register this app handles all these needs and probably more five stars since it does everything i need and for free,1i rarely log in to my account on my mac anymore this app is just amazing money transfers deposits bill pays even transferring  money people outside of chase without having to get their account information i have never had issues with it ive done the deposits by taking pictures of the checks and everything has worked just fine i love it,1the truth is  i dont know comparatively what the other bank apps offer  but when i was able to transfer money to my mom just by clicking and filling out info in under a minute come on  you got to admit that is awesome  wait you can take a picture of a check and deposit it  you mean no line and drive to the bank  chase did an excellent job,1i regularly pay my mortgage payments online and often pay more than the minimum which specifically goes towards principal i noticed you can pay more than minimum on the app however i am uncertain what that extra amount will go towards taxes principal insurance late fees etc this should mirror the same features one would have with the regular internet browser features,1this app allows you to customize your banking and update alerts on the go very user friendly and way better than the other banks i have made  quick deposits through my droid and now my iphone i really dont know what everyone is complaining about it could be the new ios that is causing issues on their phones or internet connectivity,0the only reason i got a chase account was because of this app  because everyone i know has it n says it works great for thembecause it was suppose to make it so much easier to keep an eye on ur account n take pics of ur check and deposit them and now it times out every time i try to long in ive deleted it twice and redownloaded it and it still doesnt work what is the point of having an app to my account if it doesnt even work wish i didnt even have to give this so called app a star because its bs fix ur app or dont make one obviously  whoevers good idea this was its crap,1a new bug for me at least on iphone s ios when you try to view alerts the app crashes every time  when you log in a second time you can view the alert this is extremely cumbersome and needs to be fixed while youre at it display only the new alerts when you go to the alert page instead of having to search through every account otherwise its a good app,1this feature of chase banking is a major selling feature   with it i can manage all my accounts transfer money pay bills receive low balance alerts that i set up text email or both  with the mobil app its just online banking anywhere you are on your mobil device  and in todays world i believe its important that my bank be available  as i need them  this app makes that possible,1i really like all of the upgrades theyve made over the years except one i have many accts tied to my main account and once upon a time it was possible to log in to see your alert that was showing up the most recent one without having to go to each of your accts to see if that is where the alert is its very bothersome and i wish they returned that back to the original way of showing you exactly which account had the alert and what it was,1i was pleasantly surprised to see a picture of my home city featured as the new background for the chase app what a great idea this app has changed my life as i can deposit checks with pictures and check my balance on the go i like the new display with large easy to read numbers and color contrasts to make the credited money stand out versus the debited money thank you app team,1i cant remember the last time i needed to actually go to a chase branch during daytime hours because i couldnt get what i needed from the atm app or online love chase bank love love the chase bank app so reliable and helpful and easy to use recommend to anyone who is a chase customer that was on the fence about it download it now you wont regret it,1when it works it is very usefully unfortunately it frequently doesnt work when you try to make a deposit and take the picture it tells you the picture is not clear enough even though you can read every number on the check you frequently cannot connect to the server and have to remove the app and reload it had to do this at least half a dozen timesif they can iron out the bugs it would probably be a good app,1the look of the app is great  really cool clean and appealing visuals i like that the home page adjusts according to the city youre in or a little creepy i dont ike that you cant sign up for chase quick pay but i guess thats probably a safety feature in my opinion the biggest flaw is that you are not able to search past account activity after a certain date and there isnt an option to modify your search,1i love this app or chase i dont have a computer so i do everything on my phone but i always refused to log in through the internet on my phone because i think its unsafe so with this app it really is easy for me to pay my bills and have access to my bank account at all times i even switched banks at one time and came back to chase because of this app its awesome,1the new app is finally up to date from a lay out point of view  it is also significantly improved from a ease of use point of view  it would only benefit from the possibility of customizing the quick buttons on the bottom of the view screen great app overall kudos to chase staying with the times and keeping things simple,0simple thingslike finding an atmshould always be simple finding an atm is better in this version because you dont have to log in anymore to do a find but the secure email is as best confusing the more screen says you have no new messages the secure mail page says you have three while showing counts like  giving no clue as to where the new messages might be seeing a list of recent transactions is apparently impossible call this version a good alpha the needs lots of work before going beta,1i dont need much when it comes to keeping track of my finances so this app is perfect for a recently graduated college gal if i dont have the time or gas to go to an atm to deposit my checks i can always use this app to do it and chase will email me when something is added to my account and when my check is approved i love it and im actually about to use it now,1i enjoy this ap on the whole and the deposit check feature of it worked beautifully on my old iphone  just upgraded to an iphone  and now when i attempt to take a picture of the check the box is completely black having no problems with the camera on the phone so it must be an apphone interface problem please fix it for me ,1as the title implies its the chase app has been given a great update now i can finally see much more detail in my accounts withdrawals present and available balances ebills etc what im more excited about is the update to the screen size for the iphone  absolutely love it and can now use the mobile app to accomplish my daily needs of spending and saving keep up the good work guysupdate still would love the touch id,1ridiculous it took that long ios  has been out for several months come on chase why are you not supporting touch id for login authentication i find it odd that you support apple pay which uses touch id to authenticate a purchase yet you do not allow me to sign into my bank account with touch id it is a very secure and convenient way to log into my account and i would really enjoy it if you would add it to the future update once this is added i will raise the review score,1probably the most easiest and convenient app to have on the phone just the other day some guy from the swapmeet said to just transfer money to pay and i did and bam now i have a useless weed trimmer but that was very convenient cant wait to use it for friends when they owe me money but say its in their bank account because we all have the same bank,1my needs are minimal with single account so for me its a nobrainer   i would like a secure way of logging in that was more simplistic but im ok with this  i can quickly check statements and account pay and monitor credit card and deposit checks so for me this works as stated by others this app does not remove the need to use a pc for more indepth changes and needs,1i can not think of one thing it doesnt do only thing with chase quick pay is that you have to sign up for it via computer for the first time i am assuming this is for security measures after that the app is basically a  stop shop its very clean and organized oh yeah one thing it doesnt do not an atm lol but you can deposit checks by taking a clear photo of it,1for some reason all my transactions are not being shown i know approximately how much money is in the bank as a mental note from the time i go to bed around am to when my paycheck is direct deposited around am more transactions are added to the list over drafting my  account its frustrating because if it could have just waited till regular business hours the money would be there,1so easy to use the ability to transfer funds pretty much anywhere at anytime is the best part about it to me really the only thing thats a little inconvenient is entering your password to pay bills or transfer money still not bad but the preview and the touch id log in make it easy to see how much you have in your accounts without typing anything,1this is the best tool to have with you while on the road i travel frequently usually on the companys dime but i do run across things that id like to buy that they dont pay for this app makes it easy to transfer funds into my checking account for making purchases while on the road amongst many other reasons and things,1the app is a breeze to use and looks good i had two things in my wish list that they finally realized last month they increased my business account mobile deposit limit to k per day and k per month and they just added touch id support so i dont need to keep inputting my password thank you chase ive got everything i want now from this app now,1i like the app and it works well most of the time a few suggestions theres too much downtime on weekends when they are updating their systems when depositing a check if there is an error you have to start all over again there isnt a way to view the details of a credit or debit transaction  the app doesnt update deposit amounts unless you log out and back in again,1looks and works as intended others having issue with notifications likely have not setup beyond default filters are very adjustable my only downside is not the aps but the limit on deposits amount in  days im pleased to say they have now extended the amount you can deposit so thats no issue  with a newer iphone many things are even easier,1chase is one of the best banking apps ive used the fact that i can see all my accounts transfer money easily and use quickpay with ease has made this app worthwhile i also dont mind the extra layer of security verification when needed theres too much fraud going on and id rather take the extra step than not keep fine tuning to make better but i love this app,1this is an easytouse app it is stable and does what its supposed to do my only complaint is that when using bill pay or one cannot use cut and paste in the memo fieldyou can do it from the website but not in the mobile app i have asked chase to fix this at the website but have heard nothingby the way chase  clicking on app support from the app store takes you to the mobile app web page  no way to contact you is provided,1ive worked with the employees at the crabapplealpharetta ga location and they are friendly professional and have always gone beyond  they even protect the elderly another story their mobile and computer sites are great i like how they immediately deduct your payments and not wait for them to be ultimately processed i wish they were in ma great bank they are about the people,1excellent app have always been afraid to do banking or paying bills online however this app is so user friendly it makes it idiot proof to pay bills transfer funds check for deposits etc love how u can set alerts to monitor when u a purchase had been posted to an account touch id is fantastic no password need to check balances keep up good work with this app,1i use this app to deposit all my checks the only time i need to go to the bank now is when the check exceeds the daily mobile deposit limit incredibly convenient i see other reviews complaining about the need to repeatedly enter your password but i have not encountered that at all i login with touch id and thats it for what i do with the app,1super easy to use and does all i need it to even with multiple accounts  i bank with chase for all my bank needs now except some in the most popular credit union but when it comes to banking i no longer use two others because of the service i get at the branch but most important is this app  i use it at least once a day if not more,1im a heavy user of the mobile app i utilize most aspects of the service bill pay wire transfers quick pay  online banking with quick books integration and business banking overall im very impressed with the service and functionality the mobile app hands down the best change done since chase purchased the legacy washington mutual bank,1this app is very useful and convenient i love how easy it is to check you statements and even use quick pay the only feature that i would like to see improvement is the welcome page once you log in the amount of cash in your accounts should not be so visible as soon as you log in it would be a lot more private if there were drop down menus or additional prompts to check your balance,1best banking app hands down everything is simply laid out and easy to navigate works amazing with iphone s with fingerprint verification and password protections also the quick pay feature is an added bonus too i use it almost daily overall i am glad i bank with chase and thankful that this app is available and easy to use all chase customers should have this app,1incredibly userfriendly i use quickpay to pay my rent and its sent to my landlord instantly i am able to deposit checks i receive from my second job in a snap literally i snap a pic of the check and done i am able to check my balances quickly and transfer money between checking and savings with ease i have nothing bad to say about this app,1app works pretty good and easy to use the only thing i would like to see chase change is the online check deposit limits on my business account i cant deposit up to a certain amount and when i called to see what it was they told me they werent able to tell me what the limit is so i have to go to a bank to deposit my checks at the atm since they are doing away with the drive thru,1love the banking app except for one thing when you log in with the touchid you can view the accounts but the moment you want to send money pay bills or transfer money you still have to type in your password no other financial app makes me so that the fingerprint is more accurate and safer than a password yet you still have to waste time if i wanted to view balances i would just use the preview option needs to change,1a big bank with confusing policies is only worth it for their online resources like this  deposit transfers and credit card payments are easy and their notifications are supercustomizable  great app if youre a customer and might be worth becoming a customer if only to avoid more trips to the bank by using the app,1chase app gives you the full opportunity to manage your banking activities within the reach of your fingers checking balances cashing checks transferring money and reviewing your activities is enhanced by personalized notifications to do convenience of your cellphone it makes me feel safe to know i can access and manage my account everywhere i go,1i love this chase app it allows me to have my bank account information always at the tip of my fingers any time of the day any where now i dont need to use my laptop as often as before when i did not have the chase app it also feels more secure when i access my account from public places im not concern about security or somebody spoofing my personal info keep it up guys,1app offers a lot of functionality with rewards access transaction details payment capability and more but it would get five stars if it would send me push alerts that my bill is due i get all my other bills through my banks online payment tool with reminders but chase doesnt offer ebill distribution so i have to rely on the app or my memory to tell me my bill is due,1the new chase upgrade is much better and easier to use and find what you need the balance on any credit cards is on the front page and you can find info about your balance by clicking on it payment is also really convenient i only have a cc with chase so thats all i need it for but very functional for that purpose,1love this app allows me to easily do all of my banking i like the two factor authentication forcing me to use my password whenever im doing anything that draws money from the account the only thin that would make it perfect would be if it had a search transactions function oh and if i could see the detailed information when i clicked on a line item,1ive been using this app for awhile and its really easy to use and makes payment very easy the one thing i could do without is the fingerprint access since when you log in using your thumb print you can only view your info but not make payment and such i dont find that feature useful but everything else is perfect,1i have access  which means you can always check your account the best part is you can set certain reminders like when your account is low or a certain amount of money was withdrawn great app hands down and let not forget how easy it is to transfer money from one account to another its a must have app everything at your fingertips,1easy app to use theyve made a lot of improvements of the course of time and its clear theyll continue to try to make this as user friendly and convenient as possible i use the app for a lot of stuff one thing i wish they would change is physically putting in your password to view statements once youre signed in securely having to sign in again for this is just annoying and redundant other than that i dont have too many complaints,1i love this app i tell friends to switch banks and get with chase because the app alone allows you to control all your finances and keep an eye on your spending as well switching money to and from savings is a piece of cake and handling your credit card balances and spending is just as easy pretty much everything you can ask for in an app besides having an atm tab ,1this app works like a charm it is easy to navigate and performs as a fully functional tool i use chase quick pay to pay certain bills i use mobile deposits for checks i receive without having to go to a branch activity shows up in the account right away and there is very little and unnoticeable downtime i appreciate this app,1i love this app because of how convenient it is i had an auto loan through chase and my loan showed up right on the app with my checking and savings account payments were super easy now i have the credit card which is the same way very easy to pay off and access spending details i also check my rewards frequently which is awesome i love this app,1of all my banks amp cards this app works well better and clearer than many the main negative they hide your interest charges and rates very difficult to get on the app legally they get around putting it up front as required by law because the web representation isnt your statement except that few people who access accounts via internet never see their statement thus dont know what credit is costing,0i used love this app until the recent update i could pay my bills with a single click and it would automatically deduct the amount used from your account  it was so easy to get on check account find transactions and manage all my billsnow i have to select choose dates and wait for payments to be deducted chase bank has now made the same mistakes as other banking apps my wife uses wells fargo and she complains about their online sitesapps and now the chase app has decided to follow suiti give the original app before the update  stars this new update ,1ive never had a problem with this app i do wish it was easier to transfer money from within the app without needing to go to the chase website to set up eligible transfer accounts it would also be nice to have access to our banking and routing number from the app otherwise no problems,1very easy and intuitive to use and i simply love the check deposit feature thank you chase for this excellent tool i use this app for almost all my banking activities like checking balances making payments transfer moneyjust one issue it keeps asking me to rate and review the app please fix it i have reviewed it already so stop bugging me already ,1this new ui is really great and easy to navigate also love the touch id login sadly the web interface is trying to update a similar interface which doesnt work as well for a full web page at least most of the web features are available inside this app,1i had put this app on my phone a while back but never really used it until today i couldnt get logged in to any of my credit cards on my desk computer so i thought about this app i signed in made my payment looked around a bit and was out in just a few minutes i will never use my desk computer to pay bills again,0so the app itself isnt bad its simple enough to use however the app rarely works for me it says were temporarily unable to connect please try again later this has been going on for about  months luckily i dont use chase as my main bank thank the good lord i dont because it gets frustrating i log on via the browser but it asks me to authenticate my identity each time which doesnt bother me too much because i go onto once a month but if this was my main banking i could see how it would be very frustrating,1i went into the apps alerts to shut them all off because i know i just made a payment so i dont need you to tell me what i literally just did but that alert stays no matter what why is touch id even a thing if you still need my password again for me to pay my bill or look at the alerts that i thought i turned off but they still alert me please change the overkill the app is great otherwise but these things are taking the last  stars,1we run a business and being able to deposit checks from anywhere pay and receive directly via quickpay or just check a balance is fantastic no bugs to report theres a rare crash when taking a photo of a check for deposit but not enough to remove a star,1whenever i make a transaction i have set up app notifications so to clear notifications i have to login to the app and usually its expected to be present there but we have to see under the alerts view alerts choose account and then you get to the actual notification the alert should be directly accessible on app home screen via an icon,1this latest version allows user to add payees from mobile app as well as schedule bill payments and most importantly transfer funds from chase to another bankmost useful when traveling amp needing to manage finances with security amp reliability  latest improvements make chase an international leader in mobile bank apps,1i have to check my acvounts often as well as transfer money from one account to the other and paying bills so it does what i need it to do im looking fwd to being able to use it for atm purposes like one of the other banks currently has im lazy i live in a shady area and the quicker that i can get away from an atm without getting robbed or kidnapped the better,1i had  issues in my last review both of which have been fixed there a bigger issue in that chase no longer gives you an option for where a quickpay payment is deposited so personal funds are now deposited into business accounts and vice versa a very bad precedent legally but thats not an app issue the app itself is solid,1great app it works all the time and is never slow  i like the fact i can do anything as if i were on my computer i would give it  stars except for one issue i can use my finger print to open and access my account but to do any function i must input my password what is the point of using my finger print to access my account but not being able to do anything afterwards maybe a redundant safety measure,1i use this app almost daily  it is easy to use and i never have had a problem  i deposit checks pay bills transfer money between accounts and monitor my account balances with the app  i also have noticed credit card charges that should not have occurred  thank you chase for making such an easy intuitive app,1i love using this app  it makes banking a breeze i can be anywhere at anytime and it never lets me down transferring money is easy my favorite part of the app is that it lets you choose to have alerts if a certain amount has been deposited withdrawn or your account is simply just below an amount you set the alerts for i give this app two thumbs up ,1not sure why all these other folks seem to have stability issues i love love love this app in fact after returning from australia i chose to get an account with chase again simply because of my past experience with this app better than any other bank in any country way to chase finally a bank that gets it right,1its better now i dont have to log into the website every time i have to receive money or send i share the account with my wife we have two different pins for this app on her gadgets and on mine  since she signed up first am unable to do much with this app beside checking the balance but she can send and receive money and all kinds of stuff thats the reason i give this app a three star but overall its very convenient considering my wife is home,1ive used this app ever since i received a marriott rewards credit card it allows you to keep track of spending records easily and to make secure payments with a few clicks  it has never crashed or become slowhanging one negative is the clunky connection to the marriott rewards account site theyre aware of the clunkiness but havent fixed it yet,1this is the best app i have ever used it is so efficient and easy to use i never have to go to the bank anymore i use this app at least  times a day since i have multiple credit cards and a business and saving account with chase as well i have never had a problem gaining access to all of my accounts to transfer money and pay bills,1operates fine my only issue is that it doesnt send a notification the day of a payment being due to remind me to pay it instead i get an email the next day telling me im late this isnt my main card so i dont think about it often my fault i know but still it is  a day of reminder emailpush notification is just as easy to send out as a day late one maybe its time to look for a different back up credit card,1love using this app to monitor my accounts the apple touch id only shows up when it wants to and it would be great if you could keep track of freedoms  categories and shop through chase straight from the app its behind in those areas when compared to other banks apps today but still better than physically making a trip to the bank or logging onto a computer at home,1i really like this app and im very pleased to have and to work with if there is a complaint i have it has to do with the time an purchase is made and is labeled pending till it finally cleared once that happens my balance is never the same  sometimes it will take up to  or  days at my fast pace life i need a more accurate way to know my balance at all times i am leaving it in you apps hands cause i dont have time to do the calculations every time  thats what the app is for,0i use the chase app to mobile deposit checks often  you have changed the process with this new version and it is much more clunky and less user friendly than it used to be  stop changing things just to change them  also todays check was the first time i ever had to fix the account number after taking the picture  same phone same lighting and same checks different app  you broke that also  put it back the way it was and stop messing with a good thing,1i have to reset my password almost everytime i want to use this app because i cant remember my password and you wont let me use a password that ive used before the forgot password is ridiculously complicated can you please just have touch id like all my other banking apps youre the only one that doesnt have it and i end up having to deposit my checks in my other bank accounts because i dont want to deal with trying to log into chase,1great app easy to use and up to date within minutes  it keeps my account updated with the latest transactions you can swipe at the register and actually see it appear within seconds i can easily transfer money within minutes send on a specific date amp even set several transfers up to send on different dates  love this app,1i am able to move all funds and review all accounts simple to use very happy with this app normally im the guy who doesnt give reviews my only issue or complaint is an apple problem my previous phone an iphone  could not update its ios beyond  thus no app it would be wonderful if chase could run a version for those who own an older iphone,1i like this app its easy to use and navigate im always using it to pay bills and check the status of my account one thing i would like is an inapp calculator that way i dont have to open another app to calculate how much i can spend or save and risk getting logged out only then having to log back in and finish paying my billscredit card,1i can do everything i need and the user interface is good never have an issue with depositing checks or getting access quickly i also appreciate that it requires user updates before logging on since i sometimes forget to keep my apps up to date and i wouldnt want to miss a security update on an important one like this,1this app has made banking and bill paying from a mobile phone so simple the tools available on the chase app are out of this world chase is on the forefront of new technology and with this app i may never have to go inside a branch ever again the only problem is they keep asking me to rate their app that needs to stop or there getting  stars,1i only use the app when its a necessity as i keep close tabs on my account balances and most of my bills are automated it does exactly what i need it to do in those rare instances when i need to transfer funds or pay a billperson if you expect to rely on an app to satisfy all your financial responsibilities then you should probably go back to junior high,1the app is very easy to use but there are many improvements that can be made the biggest issue i have is that when you get an activity notification it defaults to the same account and i think it should go to the most current activity related to the specific account most other activity is very easy to take care,0the app itself is not too bad but just about every time i go to use it after i have initially logged in i have to take a mandatory update which then necessitates logging in again another complaint is that if it thinks my check images are too fuzzy to use when depositing it starts the entire process again meaning i have to notice it cleared out the amount i entered previously  as a developer myself my users would string me up if i cleared out all the information they entered just because one field was bad,0every time i try to log in to chase mobile it says too many log in attempts and i have to reset my password each time my touch id disengages every other log in also which is really frustrating i have to go through this process each and every time ive called chase about this problem and they said this is the first theyve heard of it  i rely on mobile deposits bc i moved to a state where there arent any chase branches nearby  i even got a brand new iphone and the problem still persists  please fix this  this app has been messed up for months,1deposits checking acct great finding local branches could use a map though i often care not only how closest the closest branch is but also if its the direction that im walking going back and forth between each individual branch entry and its corresponding map to find a branch that is on my route is frustrating would love one map with all the branches around me,1great app for banking use it everything works well but when im trying to find a chase location out of town its hit amp miss on  it directed us to a branch and driveup atm in charleston wv that was closed and the property for sale no equipment in the drive thru so it didnt just close the day before this is not the first time for something like this with the location thing that function really needs to be better maintained,0after writing nothing but great reviews for years im super annoyed with whatever happened in the latest update my touch id feature randomly shuts off on its own so im forced to put my password which is always wrong i write these things down but somehow this damned app always says its wrong sometimes i get one attempt other times i get  either way im getting locked out and im running out of passwords the one star is because i have to and because when it does work the app is great but right now its not and most of time it doesnt work so im really annoyed with chase,1i like this app for the most part its intuitive and offers all the functionality that i need however the app keeps dropping my setting for touch logon its extremely irritating and i keep forgetting my password because ive had to change it so many times just when i think i can do something quickly in the app i have to stop everything and take the time to jump through hoops and have it turned back on please fix this,1this app is pretty good it definitely gets the job done and i really like that i can now use my fingerprint to log in because i do tend to check my account daily and it just makes it so much easier its a clean design but i cant say that the user experience is  intuitive or perhaps im just not always paying close enough attention to what action im trying to take overall its a useful app,1compared to my other banking app this one is great i havent experienced any of the other problems some users have listed and i get some of the inconveniences people any feel but i havent had any issues with this app so far really easy to transfer money with quick pay and i generally only use it to stay on top of my balance anyway,1been using it for years no complaints and i usually have plenty of nitpicky complaints this app is actually the reason i stayed with chase after moving to a county that does not have any chase bank locations no local banks had apps that could compare i do  of my banking from the appand the app is continually improving its features and aesthetic,1its easy to use quick pay transfer money see pending transactions and login with touch id lately the touch id future has been disabled for the reason that i can think of if i shut down the up and try again usually it works seems like that might be a bug youll want to take a look at,1love the fingerprint login it was a hassle to type in my looooong password while walking around in the store now i can do a quick check on my balance right before check out at the grocery store credit card balance came up just seconds after the transaction occurred thanks chase online banking has never been so easy,1great for on the go banking however the deposit checks feature has added extra steps and become more quirky with reading the account and routing numbers have had one or two snafus with sending money electronically to nonchase bankers would like to be able to change nicknames of accounts on the app rather than having to use web otherwise smooth internally thank you,1to ask a question how to improve on perfection chase has the answer  this app is constantly evolving improving the experience with every use from the classy look of the site to its ease of use  even down to the new features i use this app daily and it performs effortlessly i love it  keep improving thats what progress is all about,1im the kind of guy who likes to make sure everything is correct when it comes to my money and this app allows me to check and re check whenever i feel like it and tells me everything i need to know though there are limitations to what you can and cant do versus using the website the app is still just as good awesome and love it,1i would like to thank whoever has been responsible for developing this app and making it near as i can tell completely accessible with the voiceover screen reader that comes with every iphone im a blind iphone user and this makes the app invaluable to me and now that it includes touch id this app is even better great job thank you very much,1chase mobile is user friendly and simple to use it is one of the few mobile credit card apps that i dont get frustrated with and end up logging out to use a regular computer to do everything i need it actually works thank you chase for taking the time to release a product with value,1the app never crashes works on little data and works in every way you need it from transferring between different accountspaying bills and sending money to cashing a check through a picture the app is highly functional practical and smooth fantastic,1so i was not happy for a long time with this app everything i wanted to be able to do i couldnt information wasnt as accessible and just was not user friendly this new app has everything i need in one place accounts and credit cards its easy to use and the actual appearance is more appealing as well very satisfied,1im probably jinxing myself by saying this but ive had no problems with this app at all ive done my banking through it paid bills made transfers deposited checks but my favorite thing is taking care of my chase credit card through it it already knows everything since its chase talk about quick and easy,1i have been very happy with the chase mobile app its easy to deposit money or to transfer funds between accounts the only thing i would change is to allow higher deposit limits doesnt happen that i need that often but when it does it would be nice to have otherwise no complaints,0the interface and overall usability both deserve a solid b+ but unfortunately the app doesnt always work which is cause for concern in a banking app for example yesterday i tried to set up a basic account transfer from my savings account to my checking account went through all the steps looked just fine then nothing happened money never transferred if i cant rely on a banking app i cant trust it and therefore its useless to me im hoping they fix these issues in a future release,1this app is much better than the cluttered unreliable cumbersome  chase website  the services offered are well organized and easy to use  unlike the website the bill pay feature doesnt require that one enter  for whole dollar amounts  its intuitive and simple to use  i rarely use the website now that this app is available thumbs up for whomever designed it,1i just switched to chase after being with bofa for over  years the online deposits are great i may never have to step inside a bank again app may not be perfect but its nice to see chase making updates to it just this week adding push notification chase gets an a for effort when the competitions app is a mere link to a mobile site,0i have been using the quick deposit feature for  months thinking it is so great time saving only to find out that it is hugely flawed just this month i discover certain checks i deposited using the app never went through to my account i was never notified or anything i make multiple deposits at a time so if one check didnt clear and i was not notified i didnt catch it on my balance now i have to go through the last  months and figure out how much money im missing thanks a lot chase  very unsafe and misleading i do not recommend this app avoid using quick deposit not cool fix asap please,1this app seriously is a life savior i love that alerts me all the time and it keeps me up to date with everything i can transfer from my checkings to savings or vice versa in  minute without having to get on my laptop i just love it ive had it for a couple of months now and i just had to come back and write a review because i just really appreciate everything this app does ,1i am a student and i work at a hotel so my time to go to the bank or do other things is very limited with this app i can pay all my bills cash my checks and check my balance without leaving my house and what used to be things that would take me all morning to do now i can get them done in  min love it never has given me any problems,0after many weeks dealing with the issues that we now have with this app yesterday we finally got an update i have been patient with chase even though their app is worthless while using wifi i have kept quiet however after installing the update we are still faced with the same issues the only thing i have found to be updated is the account activity screen which in my opinion now looks cluttered its time to speak upcome on chase its not like you are unaware of the problems just read through nearly  of the reviews in the last  months everyone is complaining yet youve done nothing not even a mention to it in your recent updateyou know a we are aware of the problem and we are very sorry we are diligently working to resolve the issue a quickly as possible might actually go a long way with your customers  out of  and im rating more than just the app,0when deposit checks via iphones theres a limit of month in the past  dayswhen you are reaching the limit the app doesnt show it until you selected an account enter the amount take pictures for both sides of the check and push the submit button now it pops up the message saying youre over the limit you waisted you time why chase doesnt check the limit right after the account is picked and the amount has keyed in this way the user doesnt need to go thru the photo taking stepsbased on this inconvenient procedure i rated the app  star,1even if occasionally it doesnt work hasnt happened to me or check depositing hasnt worked havent tried it it still saves the time of logging in online and youd be no worse off than back before the app was created technology is imperfect get over it i appreciate the convenience this app brings to my banking,1ive read lots of bad reviews truth is this app doesnt make dinner for you but it works just fine  i recently installed it paid a bill transferred money between accounts and deposited a check using the image capture feature all worked perfectly and were easy the app never froze no reason to be unhappy i have an iphone ,1ive had this app for a few months now and so far do good similarly to the app i use to manage my bank account this app allows you to see the recent transactions balances rewards and even pay your chase credit card you can also manage your alerts from the app i cant really find anything wrong with the app so far maybe it would be nice if one could access older transactions and statements,1i love that i can check things wherever and whenever if i could ask for one feature addition it would be to see payments that i have scheduled in the future on the web from my home computer sometimes i cant remember if i had set up an automatic payment or not when i get a text alert that my chase card payment  is due,1great app with great features the quickpay option is especially convenient now that im away at school and my parents need to send me a few bucks every now and then i do however wish that the check deposit feature had a higher amount limit and if you cant raise the limit you guys should definitely open up a branch in tallahassee fl,1i like being able to check on my accounts so i can stay read attempt to stay within my budget this helps a lot i just wish it would list things in a better order with regards to purchase history especially with online purchases but i think thats the same for all of these kinds of things,1great app the mobile deposit limit of  is sometimes limiting i wish that limit was per customer based on your history that way chase can change that for certain customers who always deposit a certain amount and has a solid history with those deposits,1i find this app very helpful to have it is nice to be able to have a real time balance on my credit card it also is nice to keep track of points and be able to apply the points for statement credit right through the app i also like being able to pay on my account through a saved checking account that is associated with my online credit card account,1i currently live in a city where there are no chase offices but ive had my chase account for  years and had no desire to switch banks this app and all its past versions has made my life so much easier i can check my balance any time pay all my bills plus i can deposit checks and transfer funds to my local savings accounts to make withdrawals i cant imagine my financial life without the app,1this is a really easy bank app i like and use it a lot and never had a problem i like being able to deposit checks it works and makes it so easy to keep up with your balances dont know why others are having problems it must be the phone my other bank i could complain about they dont offer all the features,1this is a great and convenient app  it makes life easier when you have your banking right at your fingertips  therere so many conveniences like transferring money sending money to family members via person to person transactions and paying bills to make this app great  it has most of the features of the full website  you can even deposit checks using this app i reiterate its a great app,0i love the convenience of being able to move money and pay chase bills with the app the previous version was  stars but chase would not let me use it anymore i was forced to upgrade to a version that is harder to read the larger font and whitewashed look requires scrolling and squinting deposits and bills just blend together the softer blues and logical layout are gone i considered  stars because the app should still provide desired functionality but went with  because of the vector of inconvenience chase continues to promote,1for one who uses alerts to track activity on accounts this is a step backwards pushing alerts and messages deep into subscreensmenus if i have a notification on my icon dont make me search around to find it put it on the home page im removing a star because the reorg has made simple tasks more complicated another example is deposits being moved into a menu instead of giving instant access when logged on extra steps are not desired,1there are some glitches that need to be fixed today was the first day ive tried to transfer money between my chase accounts and other institutions i was so excited to be able to do this but when i tried i got an error message to try again later when i went back later to try again i saw that it had originally transferred the money this is quite concerning because i had to cancel the transfer after i had gotten the error message,1i dont have anything negative to say about this app except what many users have been saying which is to use the touch id technology as opposed to the standard password typing chase utilizes many protective measures why not allow something as secure as using ones own fingerprint  as others have also mentioned competitors such as capital one have already done this so it should not be impossible,1i really like the app and it meets most of my needs i have set parameters to notify me for a certain amount of withdrawal amount and if the account gets too low it doesnt have all of the features of the full website but it is nice on the go the only improvement i would suggest is a better search function for check numbers or  amounts,1thanks for touch id wish the app provided the ability to dispute a charge also its not readily apparent that there is a way to immediately report a lost or stolen card with the app the ipad app remains a bad joke with no way to view statements and doesnt have touch id its crazy that i have to view my statements on my phone rather than the larger ipad also the huge number of  star overthetop ratings made on may  looks like chase employees were told to go online and praise the app,1this is such a great app it has made it so easy for me to manage my accounts even on the go the transfers are super quick and it has definitely helped with me staying more organized with credit card payments the best part for me though is how quick chase sends you an email with a confirmation to any activity you performed on the app i really recommend it,1 as with all things could benefit from some improvements for example when viewing alerts you should be taken to the specific account to which the alert related if youve got multiple accounts you need to search through each account to find the related alert also having functionality like wells fargos my spending report would make this a premier indespensible app,1the chase app works real well for most everything you need its easy to find nearby branchesatms pay your credit card balance send money with quickpay and check your account balancesone thing that would improve the app is to be able to view checks that have been cashed when you view your checking account history,1i just opened a chase account today and downloaded this app i used boas app before and i think chases is better its interface is so really carefully designed that it looks really comfortable i tried some functions and can easily figure out how to use in contrast sometimes i was confused with some parts while using boa i will update my review after trying more functions,1i am a little disappointed on some features that i have to still log into the full site to dootherwise the app is great i know some people dont like that you have to put in your password after you use the touch id but its a security feature so personally i think its a good thing but maybe for those who dont care chase should add a option to cancel it otherwise its great and im sure it will improve ,1as a college student i need to be able to check my account anywhere i go ive used other versions of the chase app and this is my favorite so far i like the touch id sign in feature because it is quick and easy to see my account balances i also like the quick deposit feature because i do not live near an atm so it is a great alternative,1i opened my account in another state and there werent any chase branches was wonderful to know i could deposit checks on my phone since then i have moved to an area that has chase branches whew this app has helped us keep up to the minute with alerts and activities going on with my account cant live without it,1this is a great app  even when the website is down i am still able to view my mortgage account information easily it is straightforward without a lot of irrelevant information that one often has to wade through also you dont have to navigate through countless menus to get the information you require i give this app a definite thumbs up,1i love this app so much i like how you can set up notifications and get text every time you use your card its amazing because i always use my chase card and its hard to remember everything even if you check it ones or twice a week so here you go just download this app and keep tracking every single transaction,1its a very useful app but mine isnt always up to date and no its not my account because i check my balance online and everything is correct up to date unlike the app its always wrong and it takes up to a week to correct itself and under the amount of money it always says pending that is my only criticism against the app other than that its good with the message center and stuff,1i have apps for multiple banks and credit cards and this by far has the best most practical functionality i can pay bills view statements and a multitude of other options are available they really stepped up their game when they updated this app i may have to say it is better than many bank websites around,1love this app so easy to use i havent had to go to the actual bank in over a year i can check my credit card statements pay my bills transfer money and deposit checks all on my smart phone chase has great security and has alerted me almost immediately if they see anything suspicious on my account i will never bank anywhere else,1its more than i expected from a mobile app but it does what i need it to do it doesnt allow multiple bills to be paid at the same time which is a little inconvenient thats not a big deal though the app runs just fine and is nice to look at if you bank with chase anyway then theres no reason to not have it,1i use this app everyday and love the alerts you get for every transaction on the account i can can do everything on the app that can be done on the website if i could ask you that when i log into the app to check my alerts that you also put the time of the transaction on the alert next to the date thanks in advance,0i called customer service to assist with a chase quickpay from my chase account to my wifes and they could not help me and told me to walk into a chase bank and withdraw money then deposit into her account well i am on vacation and there are not any chase branches around so that isnt very helpful she needs the money today and will not be able to get it as the customer service rep said they were baffled as to why the transaction wasnt working since my wife received and email accepted the transaction and got confirmation of acceptance however no money was ever transferred,1the app is really great and easy to use for the most part the layout is very intuitive and user friendly however i would agree with some other users that the alerts could use some improvement they arent easy to get rid of a mark all as read option or something similar would be really nice to clear the + alerts i have pending on my home screen,1after watching chase tv ads about all that they offer i have to say it has been great mobile pay and deposit alerts need a n atm a list pops up quickly of my surrounding area also wanted a bank that is almost everywhere so when i have the chance to travel i know i can get to my money and have less worry,1this app has helped me in numerous ways in a everyday person with little online banking app experience this app is easy to use and is the easiest way to track your account information which is up to date to the min not many apps can show consistent  realtime cashflows and the ease of transfers i highly recommend this app to all chase users,1i really like this app comes in handy especially when i can have access to my account at any time of the day and also being able to view my balance anytime anywhere to stay on top of things like getting my bills paid to deposit money or transfer funds thanks so much chase bank you guys keep up the great work,1hard to add anything new to say about this app that hasnt already been said but ill try it is so easy i actually prefer using my phone app rather than going to chases very effective website i can do everything i need to within  minutes bravo chase for anticipating and then fulfilling your customers needs for ease clarity and security in this app,1i love them and have for years nowhowever i wish they would send us a text to let us know they are undergoing system maintenance which is usually on saturday night for whatever reason and as a  year old thats my time to rock cant do anything on the app which is unfortunate but thats all if they were to text me or let me know i wont be able to do a transfer or whatever i would give them  stars i love chase,1love this app  touch id makes it so easy to use and i use this app every single day  its a snap to transfer money to my liquid account when im out shopping for whatever  it only takes seconds and i never have a glitch it just works its been a long time since ive even been on the banks website since using this app  good job chase,0this app is so bad you should be ashamed of yourselves it is beyond pathetic it is like a school boy designed it incredibly unintuitive cheap and nasty  like the bank and your brand the only thing you have done right recently is chase private client but even that has been ruined we just received our new cards the somewhat old classy design has already been given the cheap and nasty chase treatment i notice some  star ratings for the app who do you think you are fooling tell your software interface developers to stay off the rating interface  only an insider trying to protect their bad work would try to justify this piece of junk app,1hello app world overall very happy with the ease of use and ability of transferring funds checking my account on the go also i love the fact that they have random photos of sf whenever im about to login its like they knew i love san francisco if this is your bank and you have a smart phone this is a must for all your financial needs whenever you need to be adult,1love it glad i finally was able to download it was and am disappointed that it was not available for my ipod not new enoughunfair in my eyes not everyone has the money to run right out and buy the newest gadgetespecially just because  app wants you too thank goodness for handmedowns  but other than thatit is a great app that is very easy to use recommended,1chase has been the best bank i have ever had and this app goes right along with it i havent had to log into to my account on the computer is quite awhile because i can do everything with this app i have been using it for a couple of years and use it almost daily and have not had any issues or problems with it,1my banker matthew cummins did a great job with setting me up with a bank account my family appreciates the patience and time that you took to help me set up true mobile app and feel comfortable using the app also thank you to chase mobile for showing me all my transactions right away and making deposits available as soon as possible ,1this app is very usefulhowever the alerts section needs improvement it doesnt tell you which account the other is for you have to manually scroll through each one and see if it was for that one thats fine if u only have one or two accounts but if you have several bank accounts credit cards etc   it isnt very useful,1with all the credit fraud today this app is essential set up notifications and as soon as something is purchased it sends you a notification  figured out instantly someone had my card info from an alert and was able to call immediately and get the number cancelled and another card on the way to me,1i dont like my account balance showing on my cell phone screen before i sign on thats my private information anyone who picks up my cell phone first thing in the morning and looks at the screen can see how much money i have in my account i dont like that at all please change that thanks btw i do enjoy the convenience of this app and use it every single day,1the chase mobile app is really great i love being able to transfer money to any chase user amp deposit paper checks when i cant get to the bank plus i can connect other accounts that arent chase amp transfer money to them as well one small critique your balance may be off by a few dollars give it some time to catch up to your transitions especially if you leave tips on your card,1good app but could be better each transaction needs brief history while someone clicks on a specific transaction sometimes different names appear on statement sometimes i have to use the card too many times a day if i become suspicious about a transaction amp cant remember which one was that amp want to know  need details like   pm sunoco gas station alexandria that gives detail about my transaction amp peace in mind please update,1i am thrilled to say since getting the chase app  and its been several years i havent walked into a bank i know that sounds silly but i hate going to banks waiting in line etc im paid either by check  yay chase app or through a pay pal or square type app so this is brilliant rarely have problems im stunned my friends stay with banks that dont offer this service,1love this app i have been a customer since they bought out  washington mutual the app makes it possible to pay people who are not customers as long as they have email deposit checks from my phone transfer money between accounts i set up my bills on auto pay and never have to worry about late payments love the convenience,1getting tired of the rate this app pop up i expect that from games but this is a bank professionalism would work wonders here the pop up prevents me from being able to use my fingerprint login hopefully this stops now that ive rated it you wanted a forced rating here it is if this doesnt stop and i cant start using my fingerprint login again then ill be back to down rate the app and ill also be switching banks,0very frustrating that the new update makes it so you can only see per statements rather than just scrolling down through all recent transactions now this app is like most other banking apps unintuitive its ok to have the option to see statements but too old school to make it the only option i hate how i you have to use a password to make a payment whats the purpose of a fingerprint scanner againi cant believe that theres no easy function for doing calculations such as tapping on a number to copy and adding it to a calculations workbook of some sort,1the layout is simple and the app lets you check your account send and receive funds extremely easily the notifications are great and customizable too i dont really need much more in an app so i guess if you want something basic but very user friendly this is for you but you might have more needs than i do,0whatever update removed my transactions and turn everything into statements made this app more or less useless i cant monitor my activity nearly as easily and one my phone i cant really read the statement i want to be able to check my balance review watch transactions for accuracy just a list of payments and purchases and pay my bill maybe an option for statement viewing would make sense but why would you get rid of a transaction list i cant even review recent payments,1the chase mobile app offers all you need to check your balance check your usage history and lets you pay as easy as any other online credit card companyeasier in a great many ways  if you own a chase card and live off a mobile device like the majority of people this one is great,1id like to start of by saying that i love the fact that chase has never until today pestered me for a reviewbut since i have the opportunity to give one i will i love this app the ease with which i can do my banking is incredibleim disabled and so getting up and running to the bank is not an option several of my family members have accounts and so its easy to transfer moneyi can always find out what my balance is with literally the touch of a button since i have the iphone s+ when checks come in the mail i can scan them for deposit bill pay is also an option for those accounts that dont have an app with that featurethe app is rarely down so im always in the loop its all just so easy,1this app has improved significantly since i got the first version years ago the recent addition of being able to scan checks for deposit is a huge time savings especially because i am one of those people who doesnt like to take time out of the day to go to the bank,1i use this app only for check deposits so comment is limited to this action it upgrades limits to deposit timely this allows me to instruct clients of my small business to email me checks for direct deposit no more statements from slow payers that check is in the mail if it is not in email no work app has become really valuable,1the chase app is so user friendly the fact that i can transfer money to other chase customers is great  i have an account set up for my kid amp can transfer money to that account whenever i need to very nice the few times ive had questions customer service was so wonderful amp very accommodating  i have used this app for years amp it just keeps getting better i love it,1when i switched from wells fargo a couple years ago i was disappointed with the chase app since then i have seen constant improvements applied  they pay attention to what is identified as missing   setting up payees and making payments is really easy  and i find all of my transactions visible as they are posted to the account  thanks chase,1i dont have a single bad thing to say regarding this app i use it every day and never have issues  its easy to use and ive never encountered a single problem with it im puzzled about all the complaints on here bc ive never encountered any of the problems people are talking about i suspect people like taking cheap shots at chase when their accounts are in the negative,1as someone who was new to using chase for my banking needs naturally one has to set up automatic payments i noticed that the app does not let me look up my account info ie routing and account number im basically glued to my physical computer while setting up my billing preferences with any of my service providers it would also be nice if they added a budgeting feature like my previous bank bank of america other than that the app is fine,1im not an everyday user of the app but it deposits checks sends fraud alerts and pays bills to utility companies without much hassle though possibly my interface is smoother because i generally have enough in my checking accounts to cover so they could be using my money and backcovering deposits days later like others are complaining about,1i have been with chase since  banking i have had my mortgage for many years i have all ways had a good experience with their office and app i have recommended many friends to chaseive had a couple issues with someone trying to use my cc they have text me immediately to see if i had used the card at a place i give them  rating just for that,1can we please get transaction notifications for debit and credit card use sent to our phones when we use our cards i know if you use apple pay you automatically get notifications but where i live no stores use apple pay except for rite aid i have a habit of checking my account after i make a purchase instant notifications would be great,0i hate paying bills but chase sure makes it painless also love the updates they make though a bit late to add new features for the newest iphone mainly touchidthree issues right now are that even with touchid you still have to put your password when paying bills or viewing secure messages also theres a bug with secure messages in that it says i have an unread message when theyve already been read third i clear notifications but they come back after a day or twoupdate star very annoying bug touchid would sporadically be disabled in the app,0this app is the most frustrating the touch id turns itself off after a couple of days and it when it asks you to put in your password it says youve tried too many times and need to reset it i thought it was me but this time i wrote down my password and when i put in the correct password one time the same message came up its sooo frustrating changing your password bc it makes you put in your social security number and the card number please fix this app whatever bug is in there to make this happen is beyond annoying,1the future is here bank without the hassle of actually going to your bank i specially love the quick pay feature send money to anyone with an email address it just cant get easier than this now the only thing left is to figure out a way for customers to withdraw real money from their account using this app,1i see a lot of negative reviews on this app amp am not sure why i use this app almost everyday amp love it  i only have credit cards so cant speak to other devices but everything is easy amp readily available for my activity  i can quickly see balance due activity amp payments along with statements   ive only used apple ios to access this app but its great,1everything you want to do works though the ui layout is quite poor it tries to emulate the chase online banking website which suffers from the same problems much of the useable space is wasted and items that should be quickly accessible are hidden away in dreaded hamburger menusotherwise the app could benefit from the use of security features such as touchid which enhances the security and convenience of accessing the app,1chase bank continue to place customers first when it comes to technology i agree with some of the other reviews that this is one of my most used app for a person that is disabled and on a tight budget it gives me the opportunity to micro manage in real time with all of its wonderful tools,1good app my only complaint is the alerts when you have an alert you click on alerts and it takes you to a spot where you can see the alerts for each account you have but you have to go through them all until you find the one that it gave you the push notification for they really need to change it so that all the alerts are listed easily,1i agree with the dog father  i am pleased that this app provides all the current activity  i can also check my statement balancedue and compare it to current activity so i can stay abreast of my payments  when ive had any questions amazonchase customer service is excellent and they are able to immediately and accurately answer my questions,1i use the app when i am on the go and need to send or receive chase quick pay payment transactions between my clients or to send money to friends and familythe app is user friendly and easy to check your balance watch your spending habits down to the last time i definitely recommend it ,1this app is a great convenience it works well and i use it for many banking functions without leaving home i have used it for quite some time and have never encountered a problem it is great for transferring money between accounts depositing checks paying bills and keeping track of my balance i use it often and praise it highly,1my favorite part of this app is the ability to deposit checks remotely i use that application every month and it is easy to use and uber convenient this app has proven to be pretty easy and user friendly i appreciate being able to deposit checks do quickpay and access my account through here,1i love this app that allows me to check my account at any given time then to be able to pay my bill without leaving my home especially when i can pay a bill that is like due within a day or two i can get that money in there asap this i love there is always room for improvement but right now i give it a five star it works for me,1i give it  stars because it does what its supposed to but its so slow on showing my accurate balance i got charged insufficient fund fees when i payed a netflix and adobe bill thinking i had enough in the bank but really the app didnt show me what i actually had so annoying and i had to cancel my subscription from netflix and adobe so i could get refunded money for those  bills so i can then get the insufficient fund fee taken off then i had to call netflix and adobe to resubsribe,1i use this daily love that it shows your transactions immediately on your phone screen any illegal transactions are noticed immediately transfer money from checking to savings in a flash bill pay no bank statement everything is at your fingertips the app works for all my needs direct deposits amp cash back at time of purchase who needs a bank,1knowing what is going on with my account any moment i need is really an important thing at least to me this one is so friendly and useful that im very satisfied with it i read somebody has issues with the touch id i had never has any problem only when you open it you have to wait few secos app ask you for put your finger and thats it,1totally love the new chase app amp the easy accessibility it provides as of today i have not had any real issue outside of once in awhile the touch id shutting itself off requiring me to renter my password if it stopped disengaging this function it would make the app perfect with the flexibility it provides in checking all my accounts amp paying or transferring currency,1i have downloaded my chase ap with every new iphone and have never had a problem i love the easy way everything i want to know is at my finger tips the ease of sending money to someone is my favorite part i like the billing set up also and alerts im sure there are things about this ap that bothers some but i try to keep my banking simple as i can well yes the alerts are my favorite thank you chase gwendolyn,1ive never had any problems with check deposits fingerprint technology or ease of use periodically i have to sign in with my actual password after an update or for security reasons but i dont mind i get the alerts ive set and i can check statements in pdf format if i need to go back a couple of months thanks for keeping it helpful and reliable,1i use this app to check my account transactions and balances deposit checks and verify deposits and withdrawals they all work superbly and i receive confirming emails timely and appropriately does make my life easier in these respects one improvement i would value is more contrast in the print and the ability to expand text as i have great difficulty reading on my phone,1i think the greatest feature of this app is the ability to use mobile deposit functionality unlike citi chase mobile app is capable of reading routine and account numbers and its doing it accurately the deposit limit is high due to this probably so you dont have to go to a branch to deposit a check how convenient,1this app has all of the things that i personally need on a daily basis  it is not difficult to navigate and as content modifications are made the programmers are mindful about keeping the layout from getting too cluttered  i use this app everyday and would recommend that any chase customer try it  i believe they would be very pleased,1i love this app it allows me to use my phone rather than open up my laptop to check balance make deposits using my phone transfer funds between accounts or check to see if the transaction has gone through i own a business and have a business account with chase this is useful beyond words for my situation,1i only wish that i had gotten this app sooner we only have one car and when i need to do banking it can be very frustrating because by the time my husband gets home its late now im able to make my deposits transfer monies between accounts etc and check my account balances with ease the only thing i cant do is get cash  its been great,1i have been very unhappy with poor service and more interest in trying to get hold of my money than in serving me by some not all of course of the local personnel so the only reason i maintain any accounts at chase are the superior online and mobile banking that really work in my life keep it up  not the moneygrubbing parts the mobile service part,1ive not tried many but i use the heck out of this app and it flat out performs flawlessly time after time on the rare occasion i have an issue i usually find it to be caused by my fat fingers imagine that  all in all as long as i bank with chase i will bank using this app for  of the transactions that bulletproof in my humble noncomputing down to earth opinion  have a day,1i was skeptical about having my account on a phone and about the security of this app but it has just as much security as it does via the computer and its great that i dont have to login into my computer all the time  now there are screens and other functions that are cumbersome on the app and are easier when i use the computer and thats the only reason why i didnt rate it with five stars,1the hard work of software engineering and product management on this app and the rest of the suite of chase software is obvious and well executed its a really impressive experience great performance no bugs that ive hit so many niceties and great ux points throughout well done the entire chase suite is great i would pick chase over bofa of wells fargo just because of the software they provide,0it takes more steps to make a pmt on a chase account than an external acct you would think it would be the other way around excessive and often senseless messages which persist without reason transferring funds from an external acct takes longer than merely depositing an external check with the camera on the phone system is down for maintenance every month the whole weekend it seems  frequent updates only change graphics the bugs are never fixed no ipad specific application five star ratings must be from the chase it dept employees,1this app works great i have no problems accessing my accounts to my home mortgage credit card accts savings and checking  i pay my bills through this app and transfer money when i need to  well done i love it and you will too  as with any other application remember to restart your iphone before accessing the application  for the first time,1its pretty cool but lacks more features its frustrating because i have to go to my desk top and log into the full site in order to access the rest of the features for instance seeing my rewards or ordering checks once you download this app the phone only recognizes that its a mobile so it wont open the full site love it because its easy but fustrated because it needs more features,0i have an iphone gs and was excited about the check deposit feature unfortunately the app crashes every time i try to use that feature my os is up to date and ive  deleted and reinstalled the app but no go click the deposit button app will either crash trying to access camera or crash just after picture is taken would love to create an actual bugreport for this but i dont see where id do that the support link above just points to an ad are others having this issue i guess you can vote this review up if so by saying it was helpful,1i have a iphone  and when this application was introduced it simplified my life but after the last update it wont login while connected to a wifi network i thought it was my phone but as it turns out after checking out some reviews i learned that the wifi feature needs to be turned of for proper login i fortunately have great signal most of the time but not everyone is as fortunate as i chase should really step up for their customersmax,0i havent been able to log on to my chase accounts using this app for  months  i was told the update would solve the problem  it didnt  so i cannot use the iphone chase mobile ap at all  have to sign on from my computer all the time  this is patheticit has now been  months since ibe tried to get chase to fix this app and there has been no response  i still cannot log onto chase mobile using wifi i can only log on if i use data from my iphone or i have to log on with a computer  chase has no interest in solving this problem which thousands of their customers have with this mobile applicationstill pathetic and unusable,0when i first got the app i was thrilled  i didnt have to go to the atm to deposit my checks  i hate going to the atmso this was perfect for me  but the last few weeks the app has not been cooperative  i have been able to log on to check on my accounts etc  unlike the other reviewers  however when i go to take a picture of my checks the app kicks me out  nothing i do seems to work  im very disappointed in this app  as a major financial institution the app should work without issues   now its time to go the branch,1ive been using this app for a while and it does just about everything i need i can check all of my account balances see transactions deposit checks and make transfers id love to be able to deposit my chase freedom rewards into my account in the app  i didnt notice any real changes with the most recent update still works for me,1i use this app at least twice a day i check my account balances and if i need to i can literally be at a cash register and transfer money immediately from one account to another i also deposit most checks into my account without ever going to an atm or bank its smart easy to use and very reliable by far my most used most trusted and favorite app,1im a regular user of the chase app i never had many problems with the prior version but this new update is wonderful the new design looks fresh amp elegant i love that you can read your messages in the app hopefully we will be able to send them from the app in a future release functions are easy amp smooth from bill pay to transfers chase is the best ,1ive been using this app for a few years now and i can say that the latest update has been the best one i love the easy layout and the functionality of it all this app is especially useful because i live in a state where there are no chase banks i can basically bank without a real branch using this app and still enjoy all the benefits of my account,1the app itself works good and its great to be able to check on and move funds on the go  but its on of your features the brings down the apps rating that would be the check deposit feature it is such a let down that you limit the number of checks that can be deposited per month it should be raised to at least  per month if not more whats the freedom of mobile banking if you still have to go to the bank pretty lame chase,1the new design is a significant improvement a couple of things that would be better is  when an account is shared the notes for transfers should be visible to any other parties that can see the account  when doing research and you ask for more items and go into the detail view and come back out the list is reset and you have to request more items again,1love this app makes depositing checks and moving money very easy and have never had an issue with any of it it doesnt crash and the few down times it has had have been scheduled and i am notified weeks in advanced when it will be unavailable which is always late at night when i wouldnt be banking anyways would highly recommend this,1its not the best app i can imagine others have noted issues with alerts but i have so few ive not really noticed problems with alertswhat i miss is the ability to see payee history all you get in the app is the last pay date and amount i want the last  payments because with auto pay i sometimes get ahead or behind and need to know what prior payments were not just the last onei also find the new user interface garishly colored on my ipad with what look like oversized text and numbers shoehorned into tiny spacesanother thing that this app needs is a pinnumber to get in my password is  characters of text punctuation and numbers  gibberish  for security that takes forever to type i want the option of signing in once then using a  to  digit pin,1chase you have a fantastic app on your hands here kudos to an awesome update the only complaint i have is that can you make the swipe to reach the new navigation bar a little less sensitive it seems like even when im barely scrolling up or down it takes any little movement as me trying to open the navigation bar other than that its an amazing app and literally the best banking app that i use out of amex discover and huntington,0i still have an iphone s which shouldnt matter anyway but i figured id mention it since it could be the problem  every time i try to deposit a check using the app i have issues when taking pictures i can take the picture but then i cant use or retake the picture it just zooms in good feature i tried to log in and out of the app several times try it at different times of the day on and off wifi tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app and nothing works the app truly is broken this is frustrating get it fixed asap,0as far as banking goes its okay but it runs extremely slow and fails to load about  of the time good luck trying to redeem your points because since the new update its nearly impossible from mobile especially if you dont want a gift card theres no option for credit back anymore apparently at least it doesnt show the option initially i search for it in faq it says how to redeem for cash back and no answer loads below super helpful overall a pretty bad app design,1used to love scanning and depositing small checks but in latest version that function has gotten very buggy half the time a very clear photo of a check  with very clear text  is rejected by the app repeatedly giving an error message that the image os not clear enough to be read this happens with very clear images at times also  agree with other reviewers that displaying the banks running balance next to the transactions should be a nobrainer,1chases investment and focus on consumer banking convenience is evident in this app flawless in both form and function it makes every aspect of daily banking a breeze i havent had to step foot in a chase branch in almost  yearswhich is a relief because i was getting a little annoyed with the private client pitch  where i keep my balances cannot touch this app but chase cannot touch their rates,1ive been using this app for years and have always been impressed with the user experience this was well planned well executed and delivers better functionality with each update some apps leave you wondering how you ended up where you did or if your changes were submitted i always have confidence in the chase banking app,0ive use this app ever since it was available to me it worked fantastic up to this point im assuming after my recent update it started because i never had this problem when i attempt to log in a message read unable to connect with chase at this time thank you for your patience which makes me very impatient no i have to drive to a near by branch or bank just to check my bank account which personally i dont enjoying doing knowing i should be able to access all my info i need directly on my phone,1i really like this app it does just about everything i need for day to day banking check my balances with one swipe transfer funds between accounts and deposit checks it has saved me so much time from needing to go to the bank to make a deposit im a small business owner and i like that i can deposit checks when i get them rather than having to make time to run to the bank,1i appreciate having the chase bank app but i would have to say its a bit counterproductive to have the option to log in with touch id yet not be able to do much of anything except look at your balances similar to the quick view i appreciate and understand the security measures but having the touch id should enable the user to do more ie pay bills or transfer money between the same users other chase accounts accounts otherwise its pointless,1love this app i can complete all my banking needs on my phone which is saying a lot the closest physical location is  hrs away the ease of online banking makes that possible depositing checks via camera is something my friends cant do with their local bank i also have my mortgage through chase as well customer service is topnotch,1this app is awesome when you consider the fact that you can check your balance or transfer money from your phone anytime anywhere ive run across some issues with the alerts amp emails but these have been fixed as of today i am not able to use touch id for my password ive tried everything and am still not able to use this feature  please fix this,1i always worried about someone stealing and forging the paper bank statements from my mailbox chase puts your full account number on each amp every page of your statement even on the blank pages with the digital statement i can securely view all my bank activity at a glance and i dont have to worry about missing statements in the mail anymore,1ive been a loyal customer with jpmorgan chase bank for years now their mobile bank app was one of the first mobile bank apps that were revolutionary for account holders to easily access their banking information the app is not only user friendly but extremely organized and pleasant to the eye keep up the good work,1im a firsttime bank account owner with a college checking account and i personally love this app everything is so clear and simplified and it makes it easy for me to track what it goes in and out of the account i highly suggest it to anyone looking to open an account with chase and im glad theyre working well with me during this new experience,1chase has obviously spent considerable effort to make a great app having used several versions over the years this is by far the best yet  and thats how it should be all have been accurate stable and thoroughly useful i was particularly pleased to see this version make use of iphone fingerprint to open the app saves me a lot of time not having to type a rather lengthy and complex password,1this app is so helpful for busy days when you simply dont have the time to add up all your transactions yourself or if you need a quick reminder of whats in your account before you make a purchase or even just to check in every now and then to make sure very thing looks good a necessity for new bankers and young careless spenders haha great app i use it at least twice a day,1my life changed when i found out how much i can do with this app i have  kids that im needing to transfer money to especially during those teenage years or put money in their account so they can pick up groceries for me also we have a business to run and need to keep track of transactions easy to use feel safe,1one of the best banking apps out there it is so easy to use and is so user friendly you can pretty much walk yourself right through different things even if youre unsure how to use it makes it so easy to transfer check balances etc i didnt realize i could get statements for  years either through the app,1this app is great  whether you just want a quick glance at your balance see if a deposit has dropped or reviewing recent transactions this app makes these and more functions much easier and faster since using im more on top of my finances and its a lot easier and more convenient than using the main website on a laptop,1very smooth love the check deposit thru app love bill pay very convenient it would really be nice to be able to categorize my spending by food insurance gas and etc then itd be cool to create a pie charts and stuff with that data so i can see the big picture of where my money is going chase would definitely be going the extra mile in making those features but it would be very nice to use that,1the app on my iphone used to let me login by using my thumbprint however it gave me a message one day that only the primary account can use this feature and now i have to type in my login every time  my husbands and my account are linked with his as the primary my question is why should it even matter which account i use my thumbprint to login for app works pretty good aside from the dunce who suggested programming the above security feature,0the app is nice but what is it with the touchid implementation that requires me to enter the password every time im going to make a paymentdont you realize that that defeats the purpose of having touchid enabledif i wanted to enter the super complicated password you guys require i wouldnt have enabled touchid on the first place further having touchid encourages me to have a far far more secure password  except with apps like this where i have to remember the password to enter it every time i want to make a paymentimplement touchid in the way it is supposed to look at band of america or many other banking apps out there that have successfully implemented touchid very securely and dont have to ask for your password every time i want to make a payment it is very evident that the developers are not actually using the app themselves otherwise this wouldnt be the way it is,1i am a big fan of this app it makes it so i hardly have to make a trip to the bank anymore it is very easy to use and it had everything i need i really enjoy being able to deposit checks online and also able to view my past purchases couldnt ask for anything more,1i love it its simple and easy i am able to cash my checks before pm and they are in my account early the next morning my only issue isnt with the app but how long it takes for the bank to show my money that has been removed other than that it is easy for balance review checking recent transactions and easy to log into,1i like the app but i hate having to log in to certain parts of the app such as secure messaging after i have already logged into the app at the least allow touch id to be used  there is no access to statements from the app how did that get missed  i think the app functions well is simple to navigate but isnt used by the folks who can change or improve it so it is missing things and is clunky at times a solid three stars,1regardless of what you may think of chase as a bank if you have an account with them theres no reason not to have this app it makes depositing checks transferring money and checking your balance super easy it automatically logs you out so its secure and its the only iphone app i have that has never crashed in the + years ive been using it  stars,1i love using this app everyday because its easy to use and hasnt ever given me an issue on my s i also like the design of the app very much and its easy to use and access anywhere i am i see that they are constantly striving to improve the app to make it even better and i really appreciate thatfor an app that i use everyday i am extremely happy with it,1i use this app to deposit checks transfer money alert my of low balances i have never had an issue with the app in the past  years of using it it works it is reliable and allows me to bank from anywhere i would recommend this app to any chase bank user,1ive learned to take the time delay into consideration obviously if i buy something at midnight or something its not going to automatically update my account because the bank hasnt processed the transaction through their records so i use the account balance as a general reference i dont live by it yes the delay can be a bit annoying but overall im pleased with the app,1the app is simplistic which is good in certain respects to make it user friendly however id prefer to see my balance under each transaction so i know incrementally at what pints my balance is at the current platform just shows line items of + transactions and then an overall balance at the top making it very difficult to follow where i spend my money and where my balance lies on a daily basis please fix or add this feature,1does exactly what it suppose to it makes my life easier and i have had no troubles what so ever with it the preview option is wonderful as it allows you to check your account without having to log in every time and because i have a credit card through chase i can easily monitor and pay off the amount,1i think this is a phenomenal application and the fact that it allows me to transfer money from one account to another and transfer money to another persons bank account or receive money from another persons bank account is great i have not use the check scanner but im looking forward to a time when i can,1i love this app and have used it now for a few years i have several payees set up in the bill pay option and can pay most of my monthly bills using this app transferring money is a breeze and so is depositing checks into checking or savings using the camera on your smartphone i would recommend this app for anyone with a chase account,1works better than most banking apps ive used a local credit union that doesnt have nearly the functionality as this one the only lacking component is the ability to pay my credit card from my savings account  i have to transfer from my savings to checking which takes a day and then i can pay it but thats more of a bank issue than the app,1im an over the road truck driver and there are many states and towns i go to that do not have a chase bank when i need one so getting to a branch on my schedule can be very difficult this app has saved me time and time again as i use it at least once a day as long as its available ill continue using it thank you,1i will be upfront i used to not be a fan of chase they have a monopoly in the chicago market but their tellers are always very friendly and their fraud prevention is excellent they frequently update their app and unlike other reviews i have never had an issue with taking a photo of my checks i absolutely love quick pay that feature alone should get  stars,1ive used the chase mobile app for a while and i have to say im very impressed with almost everything the only problem ive ever had is when my son tried to pay me back through quick pay and i could never receive the money funny how it works with ease when im sending money to him all in all easy to use love fingerprint technology,1the app shows the total you owe excluding the pending transactions most pending transactions go through so i think it should be added into the total the balance is deceivingly low then also it only shows the last  transactions all the other transactions have to be viewed on the statement which i do not like i like to be able to scroll through and see all my transactions without going to a paperless copy of a statement,1i love the fact that i can check my balance with just opening the app the only thing that i dont care for is that the deposit feature takes to long for the funds to be available if i go into a branch and deposit it its there to use the app makes me wait over  hours its my money and i want it now other then that great job,1i have been using this app for several years now and it has become easier and quicker with each incarnation there are certain states which do not have chase banks there for the only banking service is the mobile app unless i want to use the mail or wait until i return home the mobile app is perfect for my travel needs the only drawback is it cant deliver cash,1i regularly use the app and love having the alerts to save unexpected charges and the like but please add a screen on the business credit cards that shows the summary of current available credit as we see on the website making sure a larger purchase has sufficient  available credit would be a big help this needs to include any pending or holds,1ive deposited a check while driving in traffic ive paid my credit card walking through the city anyone critiquing this app needs a reality check my only regret is that chase is now trying to make the main website match the mobile site dont they are two different desired experiences switch back pleasethanks,1the chase app is very good and allows you to do all the bankish things nicely but i think i appreciate mostly the usable fingerprint access fast and good use of the secure apple features and capabilities of my devices others just dont work as well i hate having to fumble and look for a password when trying to access my account,1honestly its never been so easy to manage my bank account without even leaving my home i like that the chase app allows you to make check deposits pay credit card balances and manage any accounts with your phone definitely recommend it ive never had any issues with the app thank you chase mobile,1i havent had any issues with this chase app as others have with that being said i would never try depositing my checks through the app anyways unless it was an absolute emergency so for me it works too much power given to a bank app can be dangerous so i simply use it to keep up with my balance and transfer between my savings and checkings,1have truly enjoyed using this app to check on my account was able to check my account without having to sign in i no longer have this as an option did get new phone but when put app on the new phone the option to check without signing in was not given other than this have new pleased with app,1ive been using the app for several years ive never had any problems with it i update my check book with it ive transferred funds between accounts i can see how my investment account is doing as well as check and make credit card payments its allows immediate access whenever i want which i love great job on the app keep it up,1i dont have a chase bank within  miles of my house so the app comes in handy when i deposit checks easy to log into although if youre looking for the options youll have to look in the top left hand corner to find them otherwise i find the app easy to use and have yet to experience any problems,1when this app is functioning its great but it works only half of the timethe other half is me getting a message that the app is unavailable when it works it saves time from having to log on to the website i also love that they enabled the fingerprint login feature again when it works which it has not in a while also app sometimes freezes and i end up going back to the website,1the app is really good love quickpay  love swipe to see balance  love touch id to open  love how quick and easy it is to navigate  its rare when a company just gets their app right  and continue to make changes to the app as technology and their services evolve  but they do so in a way that feels a natural evolution as opposed to a hack saw of changes that leaves users lost and confused  thanks chase for the good work here,1this app is by far the best banking app that i use we have several different banking relationshipsaccounts and chase is the most user friendly theyve made it simple and allow many different services such as bank transfers from and to other banks my other banking apps are much more difficult thanks chase for being so awesome at every turn,1i use this app very often from my iphone or ipad i use the preview and the login with touch id features i hardly login to to the desktop site anymore i do my online payments thru the app and i think it is user friendly i dont know why there are so many negative comments it works great for me and ive been using it for over  years,1pros i love having quick easy almost realtime access to all of my chase bank and credit accounts in one app i can easy transfer money from one account to another receive push notifications and more cons doesnt have all of the features that the online version has like balance transfer options setting up recurring transfers etc,1the app has many great features and is easy to navigate  the primary downside is the alerts  you see you have one but when you open the alerts tab it opens to the same account page every time you have to cycle through all accounts to find the latest alert  it should either often to the specific alert or detail the active alerts,1ive used this app for over four years and so far i have not have issues this is just a basic app function on mobile device which does what i need to do such as quick pay check my balance and pay my monthly credit cards overall this app does what anyone needs to do in the moment,1chase has the best banking app i have ever used it allows me to do so much i have been using this app for many years and never had a problem the only thing i would like to see added is a section that would let me check my credit score view what is in my credit bureau  and what can i do to improve my credit score,1one of the best banking apps i frequently use chase is constantly improving it with minor changes but not so intense that you have to relearn the app one of the main reasons i have kept with chase is the convenience of banking with it i especially like the quick balance view without having to go through the whole log in process,1i really like the banking app and havent had any serious problems i like the fact that i dont have to go to the bank to deposit checks pay bills and i can always see my balances i did have one problem when i tried to deposit two checks that were similar so i did have to go into the bank for that,1now that i can access and download my monthly statements in pdf format this app does everything i want it to  its convenient comprehensive i have multiple accounts linked to the app and i have never experienced a malfunction while using it  much better for me than going to the website as i use my iphone  of the time in place of a desktop,1i cannot count the number of times the touch id feature has failed forcing me to reset my password no other touch id app i currently use does so only this one and its very nearly every time i use it to log on checking my balance login failure reset password multistep authentication log on next day rinse and repeat i appreciate the security but the sheer frustration is enough to make me curse every time i try to log on,1i cant live without this app i started banking with chase when i lived in chicago when i moved back to missouri i realized there are no branches in the entire state this lets me do my banking when i otherwise couldnt it lets me do just about everything i need its made it so i dont have to move my banking to someplace local where they dont have this kind of service,1i still like the app yet the inconvenience that i complained about in my review earlier is still a problemits at the most hectic time that i have to sign in because the apps finger print option is not given to me while i know that this is a security feature if i were superstitious i would think it is playing games with me wish this could be handled,1wish it were easier to clear alerts having to go all the way into the app and into the specific alert is annoying otherwise really like it love the sneak peek option check deposit and fund transfer couldnt be easier also would be nice if account history were searchable looking for a particular payment by name of company,1i have the chase mobile app on an iphone plus and it serves my limited purposes checking balances reviewing statements and making transfers are quick and simple the layout is user friendly the only improvement i could suggest would be to provide an address to the nearest branch or atm as opposed to simply how far away a branch is from your current location,0this app works great and have had no issues with the banking functions i just wish it had better touch functionality theres no way to bring up the touch option manually at login and the app seems to pick and choose when you are allowed to use it  not just when you turn off the phone but often just minutes after closing the app and restarting it would be  stars if it offered a fingerprint login login option at every startup,1this app seems to be getting worse not better chase was an early adapter of banking through a mobile app and i loved it now that theyve added more features the app seems to be lagging the touch id constantly turns off and forces me to use my password while this is annoying the real pain is that it requires me to rest my password every time the touch id fails i love the convenience but would take away features to have a bug free experience,1i just got a nd chase card and opened this app to find it was already set up on there  how cool is that  i love the peek feature allows me to see my card balances before i need to sign in thank youi would like to use my thumbprint to open my app if that isnt too much to accomplish securely i do love  the new look amp feel of this app all updates are improvements  kudos,1i am one among a great many fans of the chase banking app which is functional logical and eminently useable the latest updates make it even better it is very easy to look at accounts review statements and payments and to forestall problems the alert options are terrific i give a high five in addition to my five stars for making banking straightforward and accessiblehurray,1its simple and clear i wish all apps were so user friendlyupdate july   lately half the time the fingerprint id feature doesnt work and so the password needs to be entered it may be a security thing but stillalso it would be so convenient if one can enter travel alert dates onto the app other card companies allow this rather than having to phone them in,0i have only had success in the past with the check deposit feature yet now it no longer works on my app at all i can photograph just fine but when prompted to confirm account and routing numbers there are no fields in which i may provide that information i click repeatedly and in many places i suspect that field would be im terrible about losing things but this is ridiculous and its impossible to deposit my checks i write this review in the hope that somebody pertinent to the process of debugging can examine the problem and solve it,0chase seriously your app goes back and forth to much i had fingerprint log in now i dont how do you go backwards and now bill pay through the app is unavailable how do things like this happen these days this app used to be pretty good someone is making some big mistakes over there in the it department let people log in on their phones let people pay their bill on their phones and let people view their transaction history easily on their phones pull it together chase i seriously dont know how to pay my bill right now without using the app,1love the app read other reviews disappointed with lock outs and finger print recognition not working but i personally have not had that problem sending money is super fast and equally fast to receive deposits are fast and easy too only complaint i do have is that transactions take forever to show as cleared not really a problem just messes with my ocd lol,1it does what its suppose to do with the exception of some login issues due to chases it preventing login if you dont change your user name annually this app has lots of specific alerts and tools but if you choose to just do what you need to do to pay your bill check you availability or balance in these busy times this is your app,1works well on th gen touch except the check deposit  its not because the camera is not as good as the iphone its because the picture it takes gets cut in half horizontally  it other words it only takes the bottom half of the check  raised a case with chase and sent them a screen snapshot  they were very nice and said they would investigateoverall still a great app,1the only thing i can think of that would make this app better is if i could use the flash when im taking pictures of my checks a lot of the time i am standing right over it which blocks out light and makes the image blurry the flash would solve that problem completely also when i make a transfer the numbers wont go away which makes it impossible to press submit please fix,1i manage  business accounts  personal accounts and  credit cards i deposit checks several times per month and it works almost flawlessly rare occasions it wont work typically due to sloppy check writing chase did a great job bringing banking to the mobile platform this app was the primary reason i chose to use chase for my business,1thanks chase for making mobile banking safe amp easy this app works really well to give you a detailed but secure way to check your accounts and finances online with no hassle oh and i havent had any problems with depositing checks with the app what a great way to use technology very detailed and thorough highly recommend,0i really relied upon this app for paying our mortgage to chase and other payees that we have set up through the account i would rate a  star but the last few updates have been horrible when i enter an amount in the keyboard that pops up it will not clear after pushing done making it impossible to submit the action it takes up half the screen and doesnt allow for you to scroll down i have reinstalled numerous times to no avail please fix this it was working fine previously takes away the point of having a mobile app when you cant use it,0since update i cannot view this app properly on my ipad the account info is much larger than the screen not allowing user to view info clearly or easily its not very user friendly and doesnt allow user to gather complete account info such as reviewing bill check available credit etc please please get your it department to fix this you are a huge corporation and as such should have the best banking app out there this one leaves a lot to be desired your customers deserve better from you just saying,1chase did really great with this app while its necessary in life to despise all banks and in particular the people who run them someone actually deserves a bonus for this app hats off to the designers developers and mangers who decided it was worth the effort to make a banking app pleasurable being a chase customer somehow feels slightly less like in about to go bankrupt ,1i always use this app on the go whenever i need to check my balance for extra cash or to make sure a transaction went through i dont quite often use the more extensive features transfer money to other accounts deposit checks etc but its a great version thats up and im happy with how its so convenient for me,1my one criticism of the new design is in order to get to the menu where you can transfer money and do a number of other functions you need to click on the back button several times to get to the main homepage to do it if they just had the menu button up the entire time wherever you are on the app that would make this a five star review,1ive been a chase customer for  years and an app user for most of that time the app for the most part has improved with time i overall enjoy the latest version the best out of all othersmy only negative so far is that depositing checks with the app is buried more than it was previously and since i would argue that this is one of the primary purposes of the app i take away  star for thatits not necessary but i really enjoy seeing my cityscape on the login too chase has stated that the new version is designed to humanize and streamline the interface and i think theyve done well in accomplishing thatsuggestion for future versions ability to set a favorite submenu ie deposit checks per device,1i have been using this app with no real complaints for over a year but as of late my app has been telling me that i have notifications to review ie new secure messages deposit acceptance etc when i open the app to clear these notifications they do not show and the notification number never clears from my home screen not the worst thing but still quite annoying please fix,1the things i need to do most often  check my account balance transfer money pay my credit card  are all incredibly easy to do with the ios app i really appreciate the thought that went into it only a small number of things seem to have been afterthoughts and therefore are not as intuitive among them the ability to use rewards for cash back,1i use this app almost exclusively got all my banking needs i glad that it affords me the convenience of not having to drive to the bank everyday it frees up some much time to be able to do most every task on line i also appreciate the security chase has built for their clients i feel very safe doing all my banking on line thanks again chase sincerely art dominguez,1this app is great  always accurate just be careful with the account balance when you do online purchases sometimes companies wait a few days to charge your card so chase shows you the same balance from before you made the purchase not chase fault anyways love that i can always check my accounts and no problems,1if i could give this app more than a five star rating i would after they added the option to scan your finger print to get into this app it brought it from a five star app to a  star app i love this app so much the check deposit option is an amazing feature that is perfect and the paperless bill feature is wonderful this app is perfect,1i use this exceptional app daily i pay bills receive text on purchases and quick pay and receive money instantly great feature if you have a college student the app always seems to getter better with time i bank with chase because no other bank compares with their user friendly always up to date technology ,1the chase app has simplified my life in many ways gone are the days when i would have to make a random trip to the bank just to deposit one check i cant tell you enough how wonderful that feature is i pay my bills transfer between accounts and always know whats going on with my accounts thanks,1seriously save so much time with the app through pic check deposits chase quick pay when your friends owe you money or if they front you cash at a cash only venue you can simultaneously send them the amount through quick pay connected to my chase credit card too so easy so seamless no glitches i love it,1i love this app it is very easy to use and i am able to do everything i need to without having to go to the branch now saying that i dont even mind going to the branch because the customer service is amazing you walk in and you feel comfortable its like being around family i suggest the app for those times when you cant get to the branch just great,1ive been using this app for many years and it has been a solid great experience no real complaints i mainly use it for quickpay to check my balances and on the rare occasion to deposit a check it has worked wonderfully compared to the other banks i really do think that chase is the leader in technology and systems innovation their mobile app is the best by far i believe,1managing finances is always an irksome task but chase is there to make it manageable with all the new options in the app its like i dont even have to go to the bank which is pretty awesome considering they are not even in the state i currently reside in and if theres ever an issue they are a phone call away to ensure i get the help i need so that i can go on doing my duties for this country  a soldier,1i was skeptical on use of online banking with concerns of hacking there have been at least two incidents where your fraud department was right on the case and returned funds to my account i also appreciate the freeze when the card is observed used in a new location the freeze has been an inconvenience however one i understand is for my benefit when will you issue the card with the chipbest of servicing to you,0there was zero need for yet another update  all the previous versions were fine this one has taken away the ability to see due date and available credit at a glanceevery option only shows you your purchase history  you have to go into schedule payment to see the info i wanted  im sure this will be fixed during the next update seriously i wish one of these companies would stop feeling the obsessive need to update their programs so often unless there was a drastic change that was repeatedly requested by the customers,1i love this app for the sole purpose of deposits i used to get checks from people and most the time i would lose them  wash them  or just hold onto them until i go in bottom line is i am able to deposit a check immediately without hassle this has kept me from throwing money away  thanks for making banking easier chase,1i have both chase debit and chase credit cards every time i use my log in info for my debit account it will bring up my credit card account and then i have to log out and re enter the same information and then it will show my debit card account info i have no idea why it does this and it seems like a glitch but overall does not seem to safe if it opens a different account with random log in information,1i seriously love this app because it took in the option of logging in to your account by using your finger print this makes it quicker for more to access my account and also serves as a preventive control in a case where someone might be watching over me as i type in my account password overall great app,1app is great in its current shape  other banks need to catch up  some issue with respect to the alerts since it cannot be seen and the app keeps cycling to the account basic info rather than showing the alert  overall functionally it is doing almost everything i want or do over the full site  in fact the full site is more cumbersome,1i must say i really love this app i love the balance preview feature where you dont even have to log on i pay all my bills on it you can add payees change your notifications send money to my other bank and just about anything you can do on the website i just cant seem to figure out how to remove old billers from the bill pay list otherwise great app its an essential for me,1i have accountsapps at the different banking institutions and the chase app by far blows me away with the leading technology they keep investing it seems like they are always two steps ahead of the competitor and make me want to only use the chase app keep investing in your app game and youll keep my going to your app first when i think of bank apps,1this app has been with me for over  years now and i use it every other day to check my accounts manage funds quick pay pay bills and deposit checks its an amazing app that works beautifully if they cleaned up the interface a bit for message and alert views it would be perfect but it still deserves  stars,1so in  i got this app the very day i started banking period even though theres not a chase in the state of ms it was the only bank close to home  minutes drive from from home to slidell la and in la california where i moved for school and since my mom was going to be putting money in my account i just worked blah blah blahthis app has made transferring and adding money so easy on both me and my mom,1i love the chase app user experience is enjoyable and not difficult to navigate in the app preview is nice and got rid of the headache of signing in to check a balance then sign back out the alerts could be improved though sometimes the app lets you know you spent a certain amount right away other times youll get an alert a while later,1the reoccurring payments function is a great unless you need to make a change to the amount of money sent changing the amount is cumbersome at best if you want the right amount to be sent or if you dont want to send two payments the check deposit feature mostly works it doesnt recognize or accept all checks though i have trouble with the feature accepting state of california treasury checks but i just that is understandable all things considered,1i really like that i can check my accounts at the touch of my fingertips i can say this app has all the links i need to answer almost all of my questions the only down part is having to dig through the menu to get to those answers or to my alerts i would rather just tap once to get to the alerts overall the app serves its purpose,1the app is fantastic with one exception if one has multiple chase bank accounts and receives a notification rather than listing the specific notifications you have to drill into each of the separate accounts in order to find the notice you receivedlist the all of the new notifications on one screen so i know what to ignore or act upon without wasting time trying,1i have several different checking and savings accounts in a few different banks chase mobile is by far the best of them all it makes it easy to send family  friends money when they are in a bind amp easy to get paid back paying my bills has never been easier and i work on the road  days a year,1the previous version had the transfer feature listed on the home page i use this feature a lot it is now under the sub menu which i dont like i would like the option to customize my home page to whats most important to me solid app otherwise and minus my dislike for the moving of the transfer link the app continues to get better with each update,1love this app fast easy and best of all user friendly even for us less techy older folk  i love the time it saves me not having to drive to the bank stand in line etc transfer money quick pay someone pay bills check activity in accounts from anywhere and my favorite snap a pic of a check and its deposited  minutes later  great app,1plain and simple not having finger print everything and have to use password once in a while is not a downside on my part  if youre the type that like their fat burgers to be delivered to your couch  then this app might be a bit too much for you  other than that  you can do everything from transfers to online deposits  thumbs up ,1i love the chase app because you can do basically everything on it pay bills send money transfer money send electronic checks pay your rent deposit checks etc there was probably only twice where it prompted me that i had to use a desktop im very satisfied with the app and chase as a whole so glad i switched from horizon bank,1really good app dont have any problems with this at all i dont care what any one says about it never had any problems with this and it always works really good for me i think its only picky people that dont like this that always have problems with apps but im very satisfied with this four thumbs up get it only if u know how to use a phone or computer,1ive been using the chase app for several years and it has steady gotten better i do all my banking pay bills and send money etc with the chase app my chase branch had  tellers  bankers and investment broker it now has half that many and my guess is because of electronic banking that is sad but i only go to branch now to deposit into or take cash out of my accounts or visit our safety deposit box and speak with the investment broker thats how well this app works,1ive been using the chase app since its introduction and it continues to be great after many years and many updates its reliable available and does everything i need it to do to bank on the go im looking forward to future enhancements and features as they always find a way to make it better and more usable,1and this is a small thing the rest is great great app but its annoying when you get the message that youve had an idle timeout it doesnt need to show you that error because then you have to go back to the first screen to get back in it should just automatically take you back to the signon screen no error message necessary other than that best banking app there is,1i love the fact that you now can register to use chase quick pay thru the app before you had to do it from a desktop pc not to mention the other little bells and whistles such as the ability to view checks sign up for paperless statements sign in on the app with touch id etc great job chase this is the future of banking,1nowadays majority of the things can be done just using electronic device and chase app is wonderful because it has many choices of service you can get just by logging in i love the check deposit system that they have on a busy day no need to make a trip to the branch because service is allow just in your palmthank you for such wonderful app,1before other banks began to strengthen their apps chase was the first to change the way we mobile bank their app is not only super user friendly but it allows you to bank instantly on the go i never have a need anymore to make a line or transfer money at an actual bank thats what you want from your banks app,1i love this app very convenient to transfer money from account to account  cash checks keep up with daily spending and u can also pay off my chase credit card bill by using the app simply by switching money over from my debit card so simple and easy  i even send my cousin money through the app by using chase pay ,1so this app gets the job done however please add these two features to make it awesome  let me use my fingerprint instead of having to use my  character password just to pay my dang bill allow me to update my personal information via the app this way if i get a new address or phone number i can update it without having to waste my time looking for the right person to do it,1this was be an excellent app if if was not for all the secure if i had an account for  million it was be awesome however i dont all it manages to do is upset me i am not a happy camper there is way too much security on this i understand there has to be some but it only frustrates me or i would have given you a much higher score it was not like this in the beginning ,1we love using the app for online deposits and to help manage all of our accounts banking never was easier the only thing we worry about a little is having our accounts hacked using the app but it hasnt happened so far we also like that they raised the deposit limit since we moved to a state that doesnt have chase,0over all i have been with chase for about  years but lately they have been making changes and its being stupid  i used to deposit my checks and they would still give me a amount from those checks now they dont if it was a chase check they would give me my money instantly now they dont they are making me lose money i deposit cash and they hold it charge me for not having fonds and i go to a representative and they say the bank has nothing to do with  chase its not the same bank anymore dont waste money on it,1this app is super easy and user friendly i love to use chase quick pay easy way to transfer money to and from friends and family the one feature i find convenient is the swipe right for quick bank balances it saves me from logging in all the time and the online deposits is a cool feature too,1chase has made many small but major improvements that have made my life easier chase quickpay is now transferred without having to receive the notification to accept it transferring money between accounts is a lot more easier and the screen looks much simpler thank you chase ,1i literally love love this banking app i can literally do everything from home from transferring money making deposits with checks pay bills etc all from my phone yes it has a few glitches when their updating but other then that its great and guys read the instructions and emails they send you so it can make it better for you to use this app and they do keep you updated  its so easy,1if youre only going to do quick simple things like pay a bill or check the current balance the app is fine but if you want to do something more involved but still fairly simple like search for a particular transaction then this app is annoying and difficult to work with either because the function isnt on the app or because its buried deep within things,1this is great and very helpful for managing my bank accounts and credit cards while on the goi used to be able to see transactions going back in time quite a ways now i can only see back to the prior statement i liked it better when i could look at the transaction list regardless of the statement could you bring them back,1i love the chase app i love chase period best banking experience i ever had on mobile and at the branch great customer service and always on top of every transaction keep up the good work i would say more updates if they come around is always good but theres really nothing else i need from the mobile app or my experience at the local branches keep up the excellent work thank you chase,1ive been using this app the moment i got the card a year ago its nice to know that every time my card is used i get an alert text and message from the app its also great that i can pay it off the moment i use it whenever and where ever im at im glad i went with chase its my first ever credit card and im seeing nothing but good things so far,1whenever i need to take care of any banking matters i can just take out my phone the account summary has all the info im looking for i can make quick payments it truly gets rid of my feeling that i need to be in front of the computer to do my banking which is great because i am always on the move time saver and super convenient,1i love the ease with which i can facilitate transactions my only complaint is the id fingerprint its so temperamental love the chase quick pay feature and check deposit with just a photo however again its not always picture perfect and takes a few times before it accepts your deposit overall i love online  banking,1not only is banking easy the app is easy chase makes every transaction a breeze the transactions deposits transfers and history are all visible in real time i dont have to go through a full computer login or web browser it saves me time and money i have business and personal accounts and both offer every convenience,1one of the main attractions to banking with chase is robust mobile banking application for ios which lets you do almost everything you can do from a home pc and more like scan in checksi do miss the ability to access the application with the touch id im not sure why it was removed but im holding off one star from my review for if or when that feature returns,0this app is incredibly unreliable i have counted on it too many times and end up being overdrawn and in return then charged  when it seems to me that its their fault because it is not showing the correct amounts this has happened numerous times where i verify my account total before making a purchase and wake up the next day to a text saying i overdrafted which is incredibly confusing when you check your balance beforehand and know you hand the money again very unreliable app,0ever since the summer of  update the app has been useless  it always gives the too many log in attempts prompt after one attempt for which is my correct login password  i am constantly needing to change my password  i have called their customer service and they know nothing and are hard to understand as they are in another country and english is their second language  i have no issue with the bank itself but its app is garbage  bring back your old programmer because your most recent updates are bad  very frustrating,1very happy with app i can see my balances and deposit checks online i also like the chase website  very pleasing to the eye i especially like the new atms where i can get other denominations besides s and last but not least i love the rewards from my credit cards very happy with chase thank you for making everything user friendly,1love everything on how chase app works as far as transferring money or making a payments its great but  one thing that would make it excellent is being able to access he app with the option to use the finger id to log in which would be easier and less time consuming just an option doesnt have to mandatory for everyone ,1i have used the latest app since it was introduced and i felt obligated to make some comments  first i want to be clear that between my chase debit card and this app i do  of my banking  the problem with this new app is there is a lack intelligence in data linkage  i believe in an attempt to be universal in terms they have made it more difficult to logically do a payee search add multiple accounts to one payee difficult to summarize multiple account activity,1nice to do all my banking with just a touch of a button however thats where the problem lies the finger print technology is great but only if you use it often if not the system will no longer recognize your finger and the option is automatically disabled until you log in with your password and reactivate the finger print option other than that no other complaintsjoe msc,1its an okay app it gives you the details about the funds in your accounts but i wish it did a bit more than that for example there are other non bank apps that give a total transactions report easily accessible i think chase needs to update their app for better use it more convenient for their user i would also like to get the touch id back for some reason now the touch id does not work anymore with the latest update,0the app itself is fine but the developers did a poor job of the password reset function finding the proper input field for example for social security number is very unintuitive and in my case sends me to another security question without letting me input the social security number also the rules about passwords are very constraining and i have to submit three or four passwords each time before one is accepted finally the app does not let you sign in using fingerprint authentication  even bankofamericas app lets you do that,1chase really needs to have the touch id function put back on the app used to be able to do that but no longer offers that as an option which is ridiculous also you should be able to logon with different user ids and they should be able to be stored so that you dont have to enter each separate one every single time other bankingcredit card apps allow this so chase really needs to get with the program,1i like the chase app for checking my balance i like the fact that you can add the fingerprint and open it that way with no password my issue is that on the weekends if you try to make a transfer between chase accounts it wont allow you to pick the same day it preselects mondays date you have to call in to make the transfer happen immediately which defeats the purpose of having an app chase needs to fix this glitch asap,1havent had any problems with the app  the deposit function is a bit confusing though  shows a deposit to field with correct acct but then shows the checks routing and acct number as if this is where the check will be deposited confusing for me but took it on faith that check would get to the right account strangely dont remember this in previous versions,1i use this app to check my balances check for transactions that are pending or that have been paid pay my bills online and make money transfersthis app puts banking at my fingertips its highly uncommon that i have to walk into a bank any more these daysthis app keeps improving with every update keep up the good work,0check deposit feature is awful it rejects a perfectly clear picture  of the time and doesnt say which picture is unclear but you still need to take front and back pics again as well as enter the same information over again if you want to try again the alerts section doesnt specify which account has the alert so if you have linked charge cards you need to check several accounts until you figure out which one had the alert,1my banking needs are simple and this app is very intuitive i quickly learned to do all i need on my smart phone from transferring money between my accounts to seeing my recent transactions to paying friends to depositing checks the only thing i wish i could do was sort by transaction type but i can do that from my laptop,1i can pay all my monthly bills in about  minutes love the convenience quick pay is another awesome function we use a lot i have been able to function completely electronically for almost a year everything paid for using cards and applepay dont need to carry cash any more great app,1i love chase they are on there a game when it comes to customer but they need to work on there credit card and give there customers a chance to open one and as for the new update i hate it i cant swipe to see my balance and not just that the quick pay with zelle i hate it just go back to the regular quick pay now it takes a day to get the money sent out or sent to me  other than that i love chase chasecustomerforlife,1after a few times using the mobile app ive found a couple of aggravating glitches with signing on especially this time i kept getting safari couldnt find the browser which slowed things down a bit otherwise im happy to have the mobile app to manage my accountsupdatesigning on this time was much easier as was navigating through the app,1i must say we have had very good results using the chase app  however if sending a checkto a graduate or bride it takes forever and one never got there at all  outside of that the app and i have a good relationship  it makes it good when you are travelling and forgot to pay something  you just go to the app and sendthe payment  i love the ability of having everything at my fingertipsthanks chase,1i guess reviews havent been written for a while because all of the ones i saw where from  stating this took you to a mobile web version this app may have changed because now it is like logging into an app not a web page it does what it is supposed to do allow you to view your statement balance and so forth its free and if you have a chase card worth the download,1i am incredibly impressed with the secure access to my bank information from my iphone but i tried for over an hour and i cant get the depost feature to work  i am sooo disappointed  i was purely excied when i saw chases tv commercial about this new app  i couldnt wait to try it outand yet im still waiting  i will try customer service in the morning and see if they have trick i havent thought of yet  otherwise i guess its another trip to the banksigned hopefully dissapponted   ,0the fact that my roommate used my phone to check his bank account balance and ever since i get only his updates i have deleted the app and redownloaded the app several times and keep in mind i only let my roommate logon one time to his own account and ever since every day i get his updates not my own so i am literally seeing his account every morning even though i have not access his account from my phone in months now his account has managed to make itself a primary source of alerts which makes me say this appgarbage a national bank of this caliber should work on its privacy,1i use this app daily  i love the check deposit   tough until u figure out how to take the picture perfect  after that awesome havent bren to the actually bank in months  i can even pay bills on this  my husband and i both can access all our accounts at the same time   love this app   ad far ad temp unavailable i think they were updating the system  they recently made updates to the site itself,1i love this app everything works great i only have one request please increase the limit on the quick deposit to  daily and  monthly or at least give the option to whoever want their limit to be raise or not my company does not offer direct deposit and i cant use quick deposit since my check is over  ,1i use this often while im out shopping to keep track of my money but theres more to it than that i also pay my credit card payment and transfer money between accounts each month i only use those few functions but they all work consistently well,1this app works wonders  i have never had a problem with it except during updates which is fine i dont mind the updates that chase does  for those that are complaining about not being able to use quick deposit you may be using ipod touch  that feature is not available in the ipod  only the iphone and the ipad,1everything works great for me check deposits work flawlessly i dont understand why all you people are having trouble this is a fantastic app i pay bills cash checks just fine my only complaint is that the alerts keep showing up on the app icon but thats no biggy everything else is wonderful thanks chase,1this app makes paying bills and maintaining my account so incredibly easy however i wish they would include a feature that allows you to view transaction details rather than show just the post date and amount i like to keep track of the date when i spent the money as well as the date when it posted,1i have not been let down once with this app i use it every week to deposit my checks only draw back is my commission checks are too much for the daily limit but i only have to go to branch once month which is not bad at all i also love being able to transfer money between accts within a few quick mins thank you for this app,1if you rely completely on this app for all your banking transactions then you have a huge problem this app was created as a supplement to all the other online services that chase offers you guys are just too lazy to use a computer if you say you dont own a computer you are a liar quit whining and acting like babies ps laughoutloud to all the whiners who threaten to change banks just because an app temporarily stops working ha,1great app works fine for me and it alerts me whenever any changes are being made to me accountwhether it be a alert for when i spent some money or when money was deposit to my account can also pay bills with this account which is wonderful since im always busy and forgetful i recommend this app to all chase customers,1the only really annoying thing about this app besides limited functionality and overly locked down account balance info is the fact that unlike every other application that is on the iphone notifications dont clear automatically when you open the app you have to navigate to the seemingly hidden alerts section and view them to make them clear stars only because the app is stable,0i used to use this all the timeit saved me many trips to the bank which helped chase to have shorter lines in their banks however after upgrading to the iphone s which has the best camera available on any iphone i can no longer deposit a single check each time i try to deposit a check im told that my high quality photo is not clear enough ive been using this app since i had an iphone g without any problems this is super frustratingi may need to switch to a bank that can actually build a proper app if this issue is not resolved,1can check to make sure transactions and deposits have gone through and able to check my balance at any time love being able to deposit checks right from my phone versus going to an atm or branch if only i could make cash withdrawals  would also be nice to view check images that are cashed or deposited,1the new version of this app is greatly improved everything seems to work better its easy to find the information you need and in general just functions better i used to have a lot of trouble with deposits but now they going easily and i have only had trouble once where i used have trouble all the time,1overall the new interface is much smoother and clearer on my phone there are however still a few design decisions that i question  tapping the account name simply shows me the balance i have to tap the balance to get to the activity and when i go to the alerts it still cant take me directly to them i have to check each of my accounts to see what the alerts werestill a solid app and worth having,1the app is good and you made it easier to pay the bills what i would like brought back is where each withdrawal was from as this one only has the amount my wife and i both use the same account and i know where she shops but as with the previous version would make it easier to tell if someone has gotten my card information vs my having to go verify each charge,1its so great to have these apps  i love the new app that its still easy to navigate even with new features its so nice to be able to check you charges and balances especially in the times when we are so busy and on the go that it makes life a little easier to stay on top of our finances this apps makes it so easy to do  thanks chase for thinking of us,0although i love the convenience of depositing checks with my phone i really do not like the new visual appearance of any of the screens  too white not enough contrast for us with older eyes especially when depositing a check  the bright blue bar where you type the amount in a slightly different shade of blue  what were you thinking i have brightness turned way up on my phone and still had trouble verifying that i entered the correct amount please go back to the elegant blue background with white fields in which you type in black,1i read all the reviews before downloading this app and thought perhaps the ck cashing issue was for iphone  since so many mentioned that system not so  i have a s and find the next button doesnt work use for the photos is fine  i like the convenience of hand held typical banking this app affords but touch id would make me more comfortable vs keying in my password each time  check depositing  the reason i downloaded this  is critical  hope this gets resolved soon,0chase  your app used to be the best banking app around but now youve ruined your success  after reading these other messages and them saying youll have it fixed on x date and it still failed i wonder about chase overall  if by chance you dont fix prior to thanksgiving on black friday ill be opening a new account with another bank and closing the chase account  we mobile bankers cant have such a thing happen  im shocked at this but it still doesnt beat the money you needed from tax payers to fix your spending habits  time is clicking good luck,1my experience with this app has always been really great its obvious that the team responsible for its implementation has been thoughtful amp thorough in its design the attention to detail is excellent amp now that team has given the users what ive been waiting for in the most recent release the finger print id accessgreat job to the chase app team amp please keep up the good work,1this app does the job amp has recently introduced touch id to open it on iphone s or later when first fired up a nice improvement that is also being introduced by a number of other apps so far i havent come across a function i needed but couldnt access at the same time when comparing it to its peers the bank of america app is more user friendly and allows you to delve deeper into your accounts,1finally this app now has touch id and it is just as awesome as i new it would bechases app has the best security and the best user features  you can glance at your balances without logging in or you can use touch id to quickly log in to your accountshowever youll have to enter your password to access quickpay transfer balances or pay bills,1been using this app for as long as its been out it is incredibly convenient and userfriendly i hardly go to the bank any more the one problem i still have is the secure message center never loads my messages it is incredibly frustrating to see i have  new messages and i can never see them other than that its a very easy way to bank and move funds around in the comfort of my own home or while on the go,1is an indispensable tool for keeping my finances at my fingertips i use the app daily quick pay and check deposit by phone are awesome i travel frequently and i can get up to the minute info on just about everything from this easily navigated app couldnt live without it love the added swipe for quick balance and the touch id for login,1could use less of the mobile app will be unavailable due to maintenance and chase could maybe hold back on increasing fees there was once a time when a bank was a place that rewarded you with interest payments for using them to safeguard your money nowadays chase and other banks seem less concerned with its customers savings and more concerned with their own collections  when im elected potus there will be some major changes,1i have several bank accounts at a couple of banks chase has by far the most useful and user friendly app of them all every update adds ease of use and more helpful options i have only given  apps  stars this being one of them keep up the great work chase your attention to detail and user friendliness have been work the effort,1not only is chase bank awesome but so are all the customer service agents i have ever had dealings with just like the great customer service i get from an actual location the chase app doesnt disappoint easy to understand and all my debits show up within seconds of charging them easy and up to date technology that keeps me happy ,1chase has done a wonderful job of giving you all of the features you use on the pc on your phone  its extremely easy to use i havent had any down time system is unavailable network error problems so far  the fingerprint id is perfect for onthego access good job chase it team for delivering a high quality app,1after downloading the app i was prompted to reset my password because of inactivity during the attempt to reset my password i was repeatedly being told that the password didnt meet the requirements  i switched to the website and noticed that the complete list of requirements isnt included within the apps password reset area i have screenshots of both if anyone is interested feel free to reach out,1well designed amp intuitive banking app i use it a few times each month provides all of the bill payment and functionality that i need to manage my banking and credit cards i use other bank apps this is one of the better ones with full credit and banking combined access in one application,1this app is very easy to use and very responsive live a pure native app should be  the developers should be proud  one suggestion that would make this app even better after you log in using your finger print and when you want to pay a bill you are prompted to enter your  password again  you shouldnt  have to or if require you should be able to enter your  fingerprint again,1ive been a customer at another financial institution which had mobile banking and it had check images available for both deposits and checks made out really wish chase mobile app had this feature as well as more details on transaction otherwise easy to use and very basic love the mobile deposit option,1really nice user interface easy to navigate the remote deposit feature is a bit finicky and sometimes doesnt recognize a legitimate check forcing me to make the trip to the bank also the fingerprint recognition doesnt always trigger even though i have it turned on and set up lastly you cannot view the details of a deposit in the app you have to go online,1this app keeps getting better and better  love the finger print id  my passwords are so long it takes forever to type inthis app once alerted me my car had been broken into and the card was taken from the trunk of my car minutes after it happened and i was able to stop future transactions on my card where i was love love love this app,1i love this app its fast and convenient you can do everything that you could possibly need to do through online or even over the phone the check depositing is very convenient for me saves me a trip from the bank im glad it supports touch id because logging in is much faster that way thanks chase for staying current with necessary updates too,1i love this app it makes my every day tasks super easy i dont mind entering my password multiple times because it is a security protocol after all the same as reentering a pin at an atm this app saves me from taking a trip to the bank other than to get cash the account preview feature makes keeping an eye on your bank account easily accessible not one complaint,1ive had this app for a while i also have an account at boa the old drawback for this app was not being able to see check images but they added that recently works super well the deposit through the phone feature is excellent too cant complain i also like their picture that varies depending on location,1i have had the chase app since  i think the best feature i ever saw on it was the account preview feature sometimes i really dont have the time to put in my password and check my bank account but a good amount of the time while im working or in between things it was really easy to just slide over and see my account balance id really like to see the preview come back,1i use this app all the time while the alerts and messages are a little annoying the rest of the experience is great i can direct deposit through my phone check my purchases and transfer money one of my most used and useful apps on my phone thanks chase though i do miss being able to login with my fingerprint,1i like this app for the most part the finger print scanner is pretty cool since i have it on my iphone too so its easier for me to access my accounts there nothing really bad about this app i also like how i can transfer money from my checking to my savings without going inside just wish i knew how to add more accounts so i can transfer money to my friends account who also have chase,1this app is so user friendly  i use it to deposit checks from home set up automatic payments on my credit cards to transfer money to my chase credit cards for payment and also to create alerts so i will know if i get close to having a  balance  its quick and easy  i love not having to go to the bank and stand in line,1great app the reason why it lost a star was that i transfer money a lot between my chase accounts before you make a transfer you have to sign in cant use your finger print i think the only time you should have to sign in is to pay a bill or use chase quick pay the other reason is have to use a desktop to set up recurring payments besides those problems to me i love the app,0in  when i opened my chase account chase had the best banking website  chase has not updated their website since   this app is just add on junk  my biggest complaint is with the alerts  the alerts are basically taken from the outdated website  the alerts do not make sense and are too hard to manage my second biggest complaint is fraud protection is not built into the application  if theres a problem with my card or a transaction i have to call chase on the phone even if its for two dollars even if im traveling  wake up chase,1the chase app on the iphone + works flawless i especially like the finger print log in and the instant cheque deposit however i tend to have to navigate the web mobile app to accept chase quick pay for whatever reason you cant navigate  a link from quick pay notifications in your mail box to the app to accept payment youll have to use chase online,1i use it everyday because i need it every day   its user friendly i can view my bank accounts and credit cards account  its very useful that without logging in there is a preview of all of my accounts  i view my statements too once i log in and deposit checks  i havent had any problems with the app  please continue the great work,1ive been using this app a while now and its great even in an extended network i can access my online account i get notifications about any transactions i want from any account i have with chase and thats cool the deposit checks tool i can use with my iphone is wonderful but i dont handle any checks its all  cash deposits and dd for this guy so get the app its a jewel,1what could anyone have an issue with when it comes to chase theyre always on top of suspicious activity customer service is stellar i never get fees when sometimes i would even charge myself but shh and their app does everything you need it you dont have the app get it amp if youre not with chase bank then the question is why not,1the app finally lets you sign in with your fingerprint and it lets you look at some things but the layout and usability is pathetically bad they also force you to type in your password before you can pay your bill as though someone may try to hack past your thumbprint just to go pay your credit card bill totally defeats the purpose of the convenience of the touch id no other card is this stupid,0the app is ok  i do a lot of my banking from my phone and have a whole range of apps  this the the only app that requires me to log in again to pay the bill  seems counter intuitive  it is a bad ux  also the banner advertisement on the login screen is inappropriate  i pay for your service already i should not be prompted each time i log in to try a new cad from chase  the app is overall unprofessional because of this  i would love to see these two features improved  also i would love to see an ios widget created,1i find myself using this app frequently i love the convenience of depositing my checks even though it takes longer for the checks to clear than depositing them at the atm or in your local branch i transfer money from checking to savings effortlessly and monitor my daily transactions thank you chase for a great app,1ive had chase for the last  years and have been very happy with the bank and even more so with the app i barely get a chance to go in to a bank and the app truly makes it so i rarely have to the app is intuitive and meets every need i have it has actually kept me a chase customer longer than i have been at any bank,1this app handles all of the common banking activities quickly and easily uses latest touch login technology making for quick access i do wish alerts were handled better perhaps displayed by date rather than having to look at each account to find the alerts,1this app does it all from the convenience of wherever i may be at the time i can do almost all the banking i need on a daily basis from making deposits to paying bills its a great convenience and timesaver not having a chase bank in our town is of little consequence since almost everything can be done on my cellphone app id be lost without it,1i really love this app because when you are not sure of how much money you have on your credit or debit card after an amazing weekend you have this app to help you figure out how much is left on your account plus its a big thumbs up to manage your money or even to transfer money and save you the trip to go into the bank ,1this app is really great on the go no more stopping at the atm to check my balance i can literally log on my account  or just set up my quick view although i do wish you could see where you purchased your items like click on the purchase item and it shows you where at what time amp how much you spent that would be great other than that chase app it awesome quick pay couldnt be happier ,1i use the app almost everyday its easy to understand and rarely has loading issues i love being able to pay my credit card and view my freedom rewards instantly the only reoccurring issue is that it the app is picky about depositing checks by photo someday it goes through without a hitch other times it doesnt process at all all other aspects of the app are great,1this app is awesome you can make transfers between your linked accounts in seconds deposit checks with the snap of the camera always keep track of your spending and account balances and the fraud protection notifications are great you are notified right away if some suspicious activity is done on your account highly recommend,1i currently moved out of state the neatest chase bank is  hrs away if it wasnt for this app i would have to close out my account i love the fact that i can deposit my checks through the app the only improvement i wish they would make is the ability to go in and change your information such as address changes,1for the most part the app is useful but it lacks the kind of security and stability one would expect from a bank with chases vast resources not being able to use special characters for your password is poor work by chase developersalso the app has grown to be more and more unstable in the last couple of months it continues to crash and it only gets worse with each update,1perfect app for the best bank in america  a great tool for millennials and tech savvy people chase has been there for me since day    iv been to other banks and there really is no comparison this app never glitches and offers every feature you could need and other things i want like thumbprint login   oh and chance bank locations are literally everywhere  chasebanklife,1ive been using this app for several years with this app i have my chase banking accounts jp morgan brokerage account  and chase credit cards in one easy to access place  this makes it very convenient to have real time visibility to my accounts pay bills electronically deposit checks electronically and move money between accounts as needed,1very easy to use all my services at my fingertips balances instant purchase and deposit history online bill pay etc my only complaint is the mobile check deposit feature doesnt work very well i usually have to take the pics multiple times before it accepts it because the app doesnt frame them correctly when im taking them,1i have used this app for quite some time now i have had zero issues i constantly use mobile deposit and it has always accepted with no problem i use the app also to paste credit card from chase no issues there the transfer of moneys from one account to another no issues a good all around app,1convenient app im all for improvements but i wish it didnt require updates so frequently it already works very well  if it aint broke dont fix it i use it maybe once a week and usually it requires an update before it allows me to login if im using a mobile app its because life is busy already extensive updates are a drag when i want to get in do my business then get out thanks,0ive recently cleared my phone of all apps and attempted to reinstall this app but am met every time with this app is no longer available  my wife continues to use it on her iphone and i believe it even installed an update within the past month but whether i am on my home wifi work wifi or cellular i am met with this not available message  i had no problem downloading other apps including the jpmorgan app but that app isnt for use with chase accounts and told me to install the chase mobile app  i went to the app support link as well and was no help,1i like the app and it is not difficult to navigate however with the recent update the deposit tool is sometimes good and everything is fine and then sometimes the deposit tool will make me redo and redo and redo the picture of the check this is even if what i see from the picture is clear as day to me i realize apps are always a work in progress i will have to wait,1easy to use and usually current only minor down time for updates and maintenance  money transfers are almost instant balances over the weekends and holidays register the following workday and the balance is adjusted even though transactions are pending i actually use the app more than the balance in my checkbook i like the app and would recommend it  of  as there is always room for improvement,1nice little application for checking the current balances and the posted payments that hit my accounts while i am away from my computer the application gives excellent detail for each item and is laid out perfectly for easy rreading will not replace my desktop experiences but for a free appliacation i am pleased,1i absolutely love this app its easy to use and convenient i pay bills view my account transfer money deposit checks the only thing missing is having money dispense from my phone im always on the go and cant always stop at the bank this is perfect havent had any issues with it yet,1i have multiple bank and credit card accounts to maintain so its a good thing theres apps make my life easier just wish there is a option to suspend my card if i lose it and when theres a new card coming in so it alerts me my bank of america and captial one app has one im a real clutz so i need that option just a nice idea from your competitors,1in general it works pretty well except that once your billing cycle is due and when the statement of the month has been issued one is unable to view the recent transactions in the main viewwindow unless you open up the statement in other bank apps a drop down menu is provided for in the main view to allow sorting of transactions,1easy to understand able to pay bills able to do transfers easily this is really great one more good feature to have would be the ability to see checks and withdrawals but hopefully in the future this will be possibleupdate  withdrawals and checks are now able to be seen  it is a little bank in your pocket,1i use this app to deposit checks into an account for someone i care for  there is not a chase bank in my town so i love the convenience of not having to mail the check or drive to a town that does have chase  it takes a little effort at first to figure out what makes a photo of the check acceptable but after a few tries i got it to work for me  next time ill know exactly what to do,1convenient highly functional time and travel saving app for depositing checks transferring funds keeping track of funds getting alerts on my phone etc  it works with touch id too who could ask for anything more well eventually transfer of funds between chase and other banks would be incredibly helpful,1i love chase bank app i considered it changing banks to the community bank when i move to a small town to put money back into the community economy but they are bank app was terrible and many other bank apps that ive been a part of were not nearly as good as chase bank its so convenient i dont ever have to go to a branch i can do everything i need from my house love love love,1i started using this app with my iphone  it performed flawlessly newer versions fixed problems created as newer phones came out works great w my iphone  plusmaking a deposit is as quick amp simple as taking a picture of the front and back of the check you want to depositwonderful app use it all the time,1would give it  stars   but am disappointed that with all the alerts that the app offers it fails to offer an alert when possible fraudulent activity is detected such as extremely high dollar purchases appear on the account i wish they had alerted me to over  dollar purchases to my card when they occurred had to figure it out on my own while chase did finally credit my account back i feel it should have been noted and questioned by them in a timely manor extremely disappointed,1its the only option for my credit card besides the website so i have to use this app  no finger print security capability  cumbersome set up  less functionality than my other banking facilities  pleased it isnt my main bank  for such a big bank you are behind the times on facilities and capabilities on your app  invest in your customer experience  or settle for ok,1in previous versions when my debit card was swiped it would light up an alert on my iphone screen now it shows the alert but it doesnt light up the screen to draw attention this is much less useful i would love to see that feature reenabled making it alert on an apple watch when the debit card is swiped would be very useful as well,1overall the app is great  paying bills and transferring money from one account to another is effortless as others have mentioned the alerts are a pain if you have multiple chase accounts as you have to go into each account separately to find which account has the alert a red dot to signify which account has the alert would make this app perfect,1have only used app for deposits and transfers deposits work great as you can control when to take photo some other banks automatically take a pic and you have to do it over and over again before it comes out right frustrating also never had and issue transferring from savings to checking great app,1easy to navigate and customized alerts keep you up to date with banking activity informationnotifications and due dates chase quickpay feature is one of my favorites fast and easy transfers to other chase customers  just wish it would also do transactions between chase customers and other banks,1this is exactly what i want in an app for my banking account i can control my credit card points my transfers and take photos of my checks without going to the bank and not waste gas this app shows everything and takes care of my needsi wish it had the finger touch like other apple apps it is efficient and very handy,1great to have quick access to statements and next months statement balance payoff  app has not crashed and is fast on iphone  i think users get upset when they see how much they are spending so it gets a lower star  not sure what else you can ask from a credit card app as far as functionality,1i only use this as a credit card app i do not bank with chase so i really only pay my bill in app i do love the immediate text response for purchases the fingerprint log in is rather annoying if you close the app and reopen it  minutes later it does not open the fingerprint option unless you hard close the app other than that it is very convenient to be paperless,1once youre in the app it works well enough i guess the problem with this app is the login touchid is not available as far as i can see some other reviews reference touchid but it does not seem to be an option for me every time there is an update i have to change my password on my first attempt it says i have made too many unsuccessful attempts and must change the password ive changed my password six times in the last six months,1navigation is a little clunky and i sometimes wish it could show me more information however on the whole this is the most usable banking app ive ever seen and its definitely better than all other insuranceairlinewhatever apps i have used you can credibly do all your banking just from this app they keep it updated and all in all im satisfied with it great job,1i love being able to access my bank account on my mobile device with the confidence of security  i have seen other banking apps and in my opinion chase has the absolute best  also i love the way they track my account and let me know of any suspicious activity  i think ill stay with chase  you all can have those other banks,0it would be great if theyd show more detail on the transactions like you can get on their websitei also really like the fingerprint login beats trying to remember a passwordupdate im downgrading my rating because of login issues recently introduced the touch id fails and immediately locks my account i then have to login to the website on my computer and reset password because this happens so often i open the app with dread getting close to deleting it,1this app makes my life so much easier  kids need moneyi just transfer money to their accounts and they can pick it up at the atm  since i travel extensively  this has saved the day more than a few times  i also like the chase quickpay feature  if someone pays me money on quickpay  i can check right away  dont know how i functioned without the app,1good for onthefly banking when you are away from home still has a few navigation issues that need to be cleaned up to make it more user friendly chase should develop a user beta test good with its customers to get our feedback and work with us directly to make this a top notch app with their positive attitude towards customer service im surprised they havent done that already,1i would love for the app to work in landscape mode as that is how i use my plus  of the time having to constantly rotate to use your app is irksome and forces me to plan out when i use it versus using it at will what it does well is provide me with a way to deposit cheques from my living room show accurate account balances and allows for easy transfer between accounts and quick pay,1one thing that could be more helpful is when you get a notification you get the red indicator on your list of accounts or the account that had the notification comes up first i have  accounts and have myself set up for notificationsalerts on  of them id like it to have the account that has the notification easier to see thanks for asking  love this app,1i love that i can pay my house account with chase quick pay and it automatically is accepted now no more waiting on acceptance on the other side or guessing if it will go thru or that the emails were read i now have ease if mind that my mortgage is paid on time and its one less thing to think about thanks chase,0update chase has done something to mess the app up the fingerprint access doesnt work about  of the time and approx every third login the app locks me out and makes me reset my password it is getting extremely annoyingthis app works well hasnt crashed and i love the fingerprint access it is very easy to navigate around and find what you are looking for i use it almost dailyi am retired military and use navy federal credit union as my primary bank usaa also i use chase for local banking and a safety deposit box,1really enjoy instant access to all my accounts dont have all the touchid problems some have listed chase seems to be selling out with ads on top of screen dont like that but the latest update is my complainttons of white space and font is smaller its like the rolled back to an old version who designed this i want to see as much as i can on one screenupdate the design with some efficiency next time,1i thought the app worked fine but every time i turn around there is a new update that changes the format that i have to relearn all over again  and i dont see where the new formats change anything i do not like the snapshot on the newest version the last version to me was clearer and easier to follow i will figure this version out but really what are you changing other than your customers having to relearn your app overall its ok thanks,1i live this app chase seems really committed to updating and constantly seeking ease of use compared to my partner who has boa this app is a breeze ive been with chase for years and its been interesting to see how much theyve changed and how proactive they are with keeping up with technology not sure thats something you can say about a lot of other big banks,1i really love the recent update to this app with how everything is laid out i love how everything is in one view for my account recent transactions statement amount and credit limit all on one page i also really appreciate how my transactions are organized by statement as well whoever thought of that did a really great job thank you,1its a banking app you log on check your balance then log off and swipe your card at the register you can also transfer money and deposit cheques digitally i saw another review say something about the app not having touch id for login not sure what the problem is for them but mine works fine,1reliable  convenient efficient  there are times when i forget to balance my finances for the week the other day i was at he cashier and unexpectedly low on funds   in an instant i transferred funds from savings and checking and was able to continue the purchase  to do that in seconds with the app is a testament to modern technology  thank you,1perfect service amp a perfect a perfect app instant cash transfer to any other chase user no stupid hidden or blatant charges ever streamlined efficient and easy to operate  stars all around i guess the only issue id have is there arent alot of physical locations compared to other banks but thats how they maintain their exceptional standards,0this app has been updated many times and continues to get better but as a customer with over nine accounts i need and should be able to reorder my accounts in the app like i can online  why should i not be able to have my checking account show up first please let the consumer decide which account to see like you do on your website if you want the th and th star please update with this simple request like my other banks do in their apps,1havent had any problems with the app since i began using it i appreciate the check deposit feature and its been great for doing every day financial checking very easy to navigate in my opinion havent gone on rewards through the app yet though which is something i manage frequently so ill have to try that some time,1after banking with boa for  years to just be treated with no respect on serious matters it was a nice and refreshing transition to come to chase and this app is very helpful automatic money transfer and the quick pay option alone are worth using it not to mention all other options available for use would recommend to anyone,1im new to nanking with chase and was a little worried about parking at the nearest branch ha no need to park  i can do everything from the app i love it that i can deposit checks by taking photos of them easily pay bills and exchange money with friendsfamily through zelle without giving yet another app my banking info the user interface has been great so far,1great app love what chase os doing  just an idea it would be really convenient to have a simple calculator within the app its a pain to have to log off and back on every time you need a calculator for a finance based app like this one it would be really nice to have one right there in the app that you could just pop out use it and then go right back to paying bills or transferring money without having to log back on,1i love the ability to deposit checks from home  thats revolutionary id love it more if it actually worked amp didnt crash halfway through the process force me to start again only to have it crash again next alerts i get annoying alerts from the app but cant find the place in the app where you change alert settings maybe theres a way amp i just havent found it but if thats the case it needs to be more obvious,1it would be nice if i had the option to see all of my alerts for all of my accounts in one list rather than having to go account by account to see which one has the alert it would also be nice to be able to clear the alerts so i can know which ones i have seen already  and when i go to the alerts remove the badge showing that i have a new alert waiting for me,1you should be able to check your secure message center messages the worst is when you get an email telling you that you have a message and you cannot check it then on iphones you cannot access their regular site because it will detect and force you to use their mobile formatted site which is also pretty slick but you cannot check messages there either,1it would be nice if when you get an alert and you go to check it takes you directly to the account that sent the alert whats the point of clearing your alerts automatically if the first account you look at isnt necessarily the account that the alert was intended for i shouldnt be looking at my checking accounts alert history if its my credit card that sent the alert,1almost all features work fine check my balances amp pay my bills wno problem  but the only reason i downloaded the app was for the check deposit feature but it doesnt always work causing me to deposit my check at the bank itself which makes this app extremely frustrating  ive had the app for about  months amp have only been able to electronically deposit my weekly paycheck twice needs alot of work,0the mobile check deposit is the worst feature ive encountered throughout any apps i deposited a check via mobile after  days customer service explained that it was still processing i told them i needed the money for rent and to cancel the online deposit so i could simply deposit it at a nearby branch they told me that it wasnt possible to do that and if i attempted to do so i could be charged with fraud so if you expect the money in less than a week do not use this app wonderful for locating branches and checking your balanceactivity on the other hand,1i dont know what others are complaining about this is an excellent app very easy to use problem arises if you have a poor internet connection so dont blame the app the problem i had with depositing check is if the signee signs the check covering part of the checking account number and of course if the check amount is over the limit,1this app is good and all honestly i dont have problem with log in or anything else only one probem its the balance activity they updated super late and confusing for example puchased an item their charged immediately in the system but if the item got cancelled they dont fix it soon enough in account i dont mean updated immediately for balance activity  days ill be ok but cmon its been  weeks and nothing changes in account seriously,1ive been using this app for about  years and it works great  i especially like the push notification feature for transactions i seti do not have chase checking savings or deposit accounts so i cannot speak to those functions  credit card pending transactions show as pending immediately after the charge occursi use the app also to make payments and view rewards  payments are easy and can be scheduled in advance  pending payments are easy to view  rewards are easy to view and i like the push notification through the app when i have enough rewards to redeemim a long time over  year customer of first usagtbank onegtchase and things just keep getting better,1sounds like there are a lot of people that are challenged or using a droid i love this app function is perfectly fine i have had zero problems transferring money using quick pay mobile deposits or paying my bills i suggest they go to a branch and have someone show them how to use the app if they are having issues i use it everyday,1i really like the useful features that allow me to glance at my account fluidly the design of the app is clean and easy to maneuver in its just convenient to be able to access my financial needs at the touch of my iphone the updates keep making more options  features coming one thing i would like to see is maybe an updated graphically login screen its kind of blah app works as promised overall,0if you try to deposit a check or make payment on a iphone  after you input a key or number with the keypad that slides up but does not go back down when you press done on the depositing a check you can bypass the keyboard by not pressing the done button after you input the amount and scroll down the screen little and touch the bottom part to dismiss the keyboard but when making a payment good luck trying because it just doesnt work on a iphone  not sure about other phone models since i only have a iphone  at this time,1dont know what these people are complaining about below me but it does the job for mecheck balancesdeposit checkspay and receive paymentsif u looking for a more managing app then get mintand for the people complaining about depositing check on a gsthat camera and phone is out of date of course u not gone be able to get good shotsjust thought i do a review since a do its job app was getting bad reviews,1this app is amazing can do everything i need to only complaint is when i receive alertsi dont know which account it is for it would be helpful for there to be some kind of notification beside whichever account has the alert so i dont have to go through each one to find where there is an important issue other than that i love it,1chase continues to offer great customer service and this app is no exception  although you cannot quite do everything online on the app all the essentials and more are there  we recently opened up some accounts at another bank for budgeting purposes  although this bank is known as an excellent retail bank they do not have the same customer service level as chase in branch online or mobile,1i understand the fact that app designers want to scale down mobile apps from their desktop websites i just wish theyd still give them back door access to all functionality i always seem to miss the second month of payments because i cant set up or edit recurring payments in the appand im too lazy to log into the website god bless mobile apps when they arent too scaled down,1on the go this is the app to have all your banking can be done from your phone the  fee for overdrafts is a pain in the a and costly but can be avoided by setting up text alerts all in all im very happy with it you can even deposit checks from your phone by taking pictures of them if you have a chase account this is a must have,1hands down best mobile banking periodthe recent update made a lot of improvementsthe alerts are an invaluable tool to help manage my budget and even helped me prevent a fraudulent attack on my credit card check deposit quick pay wire transfermy local bank offers nothing as useful or as powerful as the chase mobile app,1the new version is better but as a banker with boa i have to say the boa app gives more information i keep tabs on my money and having the ability to see the check get the correct name of the business which i complete the transaction with is important the app is better than its pervious version but they still have some more work to do in order to get the five star rating,1i have always liked this app for the functionality  however the new look of it has too much going on  i liked the simplicity of it before  the size of the font when i am reviewing my account activity is too large  i used to be able to quickly review my account now it takes too much space on the screen and requires more scrolling  it seems minor but makes quick viewing more time consuming,1i would be completely lost without the chase mobile app with it i can keep track of all of my accounts get alerts when the accounts fall below my preset limits and i know when someone my wife uses the accountit is great for transferring funds and making credit card paymentsa must for anyone with a chase account,1i love chase not only the app is amazingly easy to maneuver but the bank itself provides awesome servicesi had some irregularities on my last bank online statement and i called them right away to report the problembam next day i got a text message in my phone saying it was indeed a mistake so i got my money back right after thatvery please with chase and chase app,1i got it for convenience it does that my husband would nearly overdraw his personal account because he relied to heavily in the chase text alerts got him this app and now he knows exactly how much he has in his account his is absolutely not smart phone literate but he learned this app with no problems and he actually thanked me for it i wouldnt be without it  ,0i used to love the simplicity and convenience of this app as i work out of town where a chase branch is unavailable since the recent forced update however the app nearly always crashes or freezes im unable to check alerts see transactions or make transfers  i may be forced to switch both my checking and savings accounts to a bank with branches in both my home and work towns i keep checking for an update to fix this horrible update but nothing sad because i really did like the original app,0in general it works the way it should  a few complaints   why do we have to update in order to continue using the app   i keep it on my phone for convenience but im not always at home to download the update which means the app is useless  second   is there a way to view statements from either the app or the mobile site   i desperately needed to do this a week or two ago and nothing worked   i had to resort to another site to get the information in needed  thanks a lot,1i use this app every day for banking including moving funds paying bills wiring funds and reviewing credit card charges  i also use it for my brokerage accounts and its fine although a bit annoying that you have to click into each individual stock to see the days movement only shows lifetodate for each security on the main screen,1i really like the simplicity behind the app with the capability of being powerful enough to do everything i could want the app to do the login is quick and easy especially with the addition of the fingerprint scan login the ability to quickly see and manage my accounts down to the individual itemization list is useful,1chase mobil app is simply the easiest most user friendly app there is they make it idiot proof which in my case is much appreciated  i use it often and for more than  years i have had zero problems the customer service is second to none and i would urge everyone reading this to go get a chase account and start using the app by the way i dont work for chase,1im very happy to see touch id supportit makes my life easier when dealing with my chase accounts in fact im more likely to use my chase accounts when making a deposit rather than accounts i have with other banks simply for the ease of use getting into the app i dont have to look up amp enter my password any more,0i really want to like the app overall it does what it needs to do and im able to access most of the capabilities with ease  however i occasionally get checks and have never been able to successfully complete a quick deposit transaction despite having and confirming and frequently reconfirming account information  that this is a highlighted feature in chases marketing and to not have this basic capability working is an extremely frustrating experience,0im disappointed in how the app displays purchase information after being used to the efficacy of the bank of america app the chase app doesnt make the cut it would help if it showed what the balance was after each purchase instead of having me wait until the transaction clears also there is no clear distinction between statements and i have to guess where one ends and the other begins these changes would be a good start towards a better app to help me manage my account,1i cant always get to a computer or atm and this app makes everything so much easier the deposit feature has really improved drastically the camera actually takes the picture on the first try now i just wish i could deposit more than  since my work doesnt offer direct deposit,0where i should start with app  ok due to my kind of business i do have accounts with few banks so of do compare this app to wellsfargo to deposit checks  oh boy this app will go out of business  always have to hold the phone and most of the time error comes out and says picture is not clear bla bla bla but the same check and using the same phone try out with wellsfargo app you will say wow the app does every thing for you from draw the line for you and even take the right picture and the second point if you compare chase app to bank of america app  good lord where i should start  more secure or more options and much easier to use and faster and give good option to stop your atm card right a way if gets lost over all its much more to it but i love banking with chase and chase as part of customer service needs to improve this application please lets do a real app update,1after the recent ios update with my apple iphone my chase app has not been functioning correctly whenever i use touch id to sign in the app closes ive restarted the phone and closed the app multiple times but the same issue occurs when i try to sign in using touch id i can still sign in by typing my id and pw manually but im still frustrated with this issue as i have gotten used to the convenience of the touch id option,1hey people complaining about having to type a password for anything but looking at you balance dont you realize how easy anyone else can add their fingerprint to your phone  digit pin why do you think that is more secure than a password  get real chase has security down im glad no one can withdraw funds with just a finger print read,1the only complaint i would have had about this app was how long it took to get on board the touch id train but theyre on it now for the most part other than you still have to enter your password to actually do anything with your money  the previously released preview function did that just fine  i still love it though,1the app and online banking is by far the most sophisticated and easy to use system any device and all my personal and business accounts are in one profile each account can transfer to any other or any bank there really isnt a feature in banking that cannot be easily accomplished with chase,1chases app helps to keep track of your accounts this is especially useful with their alerts function which can send you a message when you go below a certain limit you set in this day where saving is essential that feature alone not only makes this app amazing but beyond useful so i can reach my savings goals,1i am not a  tech smart person at all and even i can use this app i will admit it took me awhile before i got the confidence to deposit checks with it but after i started i found out that it was so simple and saved me so much time i hardly ever go to the bank anymore only reason i didnt give this a five star is because i cant read my notifications on my iphone  love everything else great app thanks ,1the ease of photo deposits the ability to transfer money to other accounts and send money to friends family or businesses auto pay bills see your balance with a slide of your finger receive alerts and now fingerprint recognition  lets see this app has saved me at least  trips to the bankso yes i love this app,1first of all i love the fact that i can deposit my checks by taking a picture i have a very busy schedule and this makes my life so much easier i love having quick access to my accounts to make sure i know whats going on at all times ive never had an issue with this app before knock on wood would totally recommend,1i really do love all the things this app has to offer everything from quick viewing your balance to paying bills although i wish theyd make a widget for the notification center i could just swipe down from whatever app im in and see my balance instead of actually looking for the app and opening it,1i use this app all the time to set up new payments and cancel payments and see whos been paid personally i think chase bank is one of the best online bill pay system color is i like the preview option when i didnt have fingerprint id but now that i have that on my new phone it makes it even better,1i havent had any issues using the chase mobile app its suppose to be safer than accessing it through the web browser it shows my bank account and my credit card freedom info the only thing i wish they had was the ability to schedule automatic payments for my credit card but its really good and havent experienced any technical issues thus far,1too many error messages or lack of availability due to system work im not sure why so many people writing reviews feel the need to tell others what is wrong with their experience with the app many people are technically savvy enough to know to upgrade apps use alerts or update their messaging notification styles for their phones some people simply do not care for the experience if you have an exceptional experience then great leave it at that,1this app has all the features i want and is easy and quick to use i love being able to access the rewards program from the app too the only thing i miss is being able to use my fingerprint to login ever since i updated my phone i havent been able to use it probably my error though,1i can do everything i need with this app check my accounts quickly look over each expenditure pay my accounts but the visual side of it could use a little upgrade the text is a bit small often particularly in the pay credit card section as i said very good overall,1great working app i use the app everyday the app allows you to access all your banking information without you having to go into the bank anything you need to know about your account would be on the app the app also has a great feature instead of typing your password you are able to scan your finger overall great app,1i been using this app from anywhere  in and out of usa and provided me great solutions to my financial need i can be able to do many transaccin from anywhere at anytime when i needed the most such as  transfer payment check my balance and make deposit etc i highly recommend this app it will be nice if i will be able to maje a copy or print my transactions to my documents ,1ive been with this bank for most of my grown up life but  years ago i moved to kansas where there is not a single chase bank the app has made it easy for me to continue with my account being able to send and receive money deposit checks check my balance in real time i definitely recommend it to anyone,1chase simply outdid themselves when it came to pumping resources and efforts into getting this app released for iphone customers i love that im able to seamlessly link together all of my chase accounts and view them under one account login through the app as well as incorporating the useful fingerprinting feature in ios for authentication purposes well done chase,0for a while now i cant sign in on my iphone  it says cant sign in because they no longer support below v my ios cant go to v  its like theyre saying sampampw you people with older phones  ive only had mine about  or  years  just discovered if i delete and try to reinstall the app it says you can get the last compatible version and gives a button that says download but when i press download it looks like its doing something but the icon never appears my ios is up to date for the highest my phone will allow,1i like this app mostly but if you sign on with your touch id you should have access to everything  i guess that gives it an extra but if security but finger print should be pretty safe another thing to correct is that putting in an amount to pay the qwerty keyboard comes not a numeric one and after you choose to put in a number it goes back to just the qwerty keyboard very annoying,1beware of this credit card company they did they give you a balance that you have to pay and if youd if you dont pay the balance the day before your statement closes then your card will incur charges after youve already paid the card off they will not help you and they are horrible very bad card,1i like this app a lot  its better by far than any of the others ive tried bofa and wells includedheres some requests give me a section or option to just view my check activity easily i want to see all the checks ive deposited and paid out i want to be able to filter by date right now i have to scan through all my other stuff when i am in an account  looking at activity let me search for a transaction  for example im in my credit card or bank account looking for an airline transaction  let me search for united let me rename accounts i have my kids savings accounts and i cant tell which is which by the generic name and last few digits of the account number,1im absolutely in love with this app super user friendly you can quick pay anyone with just a couple clicks pay your credit card and see your balance if you have the new iphone you can use your finger print to access your account and that in itself is pretty amazing there is absolutely nothing i would change,1i ended up with jp morgan when my mortgage company sold the loan with the way technology is on the rise we are all looking for better and convenient way to deal with the every day chores chase unlike some others has in my opinion included everything you need to do just that because there is no chase branch where i live i welcome the tech although you sometimes want to be able to do the face to face,1i am what would be considered a hippie  i with all of my heart should despise everything that chase stands forbut i cant  i have never banked with anyone who gave more respect to veterans who have gone out of their way to help me avoid fees  my local branches whether here in wa in socal or back east have been consistently staffed with friendly knowledgeable and professional team membersand the app  the app is awesome,1everything you could need to do via mobile banking is incredibly easy and efficient  being able to deposit checks and having a significant amount of control over your alerts etc overall great improvements over previous versions and their competitors mobile apps,1finally this app uses touch id thats really all i have to say been with chase awhile and i like the things they do get this app gives you lots of control over your accounts it tells me when i have a low balance when ive spent a certain amount i can deposit checks and what not solid app from a solid company thanks chase,1this is a cool app but there a couple things i would like to see resolved  first and foremost allow the apple fingerprint to unlock the app instead of password all the time  please   then the chase pay it is hard to do it on the app it keeps dropping and having to restart  and make it so you can choose what you see  if i dont want my investment account to show up i want the option to hide it  thanks,1i love this app so much  i live in a town where there is no chase bank or an atm machine  i opened my account when i lived in a city that had multiple banks and atms  then i moved back to my hometown and i was stuck  none of the banks or credit unions had an app  it was a big problem to even cash checks since i did not have a bank accountand did not want to open an account  i am very happy with chase bank,1i have a number of cards that i use especially when i travel so i set limits etc or card and this works for me but what is even a better comfort is that when i go to payoff my cards  check the statuspaid or need to pay alerts etc i know that it is just a click away and easy to use bravo chasejason parker,1the only problem i have with this app is when im paying bills or transferring money and old account i had in  keeps showing up the bank does not see this account on their side therefore they tell me they cant change it i accidentally clicked on the old account to pay a bill one time so that bill i was paying was almost late before i caught it,1this app is a must easy to use it keeps me up to date with my card and rewards if you do a lot of away from home charges on your card i recommend you use this app we have found charges not made by us and was able to deal with the problem right away not waiting on a statement to see what charges were made is great,1i love my chase app it really keeps me informed of what is happening with my account its so easy to transfer money for half of the bills concert tickets etc i would like the option to edit the send to list as some of the contacts would only be a onetime deal and having to find the right contact among a group of people who no longer apply is daunting other than that its a fantastic app,1i have been using chase online since before it was a web site  in the beginning you put in a floppy disk did your transactions then uploaded information they would confirm all transactions it was great when it started and is still great kudos to chase they make banking online as user friendly as can be,1powerful easy to use love the touch id login and the fact that they wait until after youve logged out to prompt you about leaving a review probably sounds dumb but thats a big irritation for me when apps prompt you right after you open them if im opening the app its because i want to use it now not because i want to write a review,1love being able to check my bank account on my phone fingerprint feature is awesome glad they make me log in with the password if i want to make a transfer the alerts are great as well i have it set up to alert me when i spend over a certain amount or when i get a deposit over a certain amount very helpful,1relogin with password to ultimate rewards is required to view cashback calendar which does not make sense should have quick access to cash back calendar to view current deals discover app provides easy access to the samewhen we click logout option there is no option to touch id login again either we have to kill app and reopen for touch login or type in password to relogin without killing app,1this is a great app sometimes i will be sitting in the fast food drive through checking my balance before i could leave i would receive a message this also reminded me to change my notification level im the one who was scared of cell phone banking now i am tickled to have it i dont use everything but i use it to my comfort level,0when i first downloaded the app and set my alerts everything worked perfectly after the update my alerts stopped working i have it set to send me notifications for certain events but i am noticing i am not getting any notifications whatsoever i went in and double checked my setting and they are still the same i hope this isnt like it was with the touch id where i have to remove and reinstall it to get the notifications working again soooo frustrating,1push notificationsif i elect to receive them dont store them in the app as well   that makes me go into the app and clear them there as well taking the convenience out of the equation  passwordi sign in using biometrics  why do i need to enter a password to pay my bill    anyone that wants to pay my bill is more than welcome    better account activity visibilityrunning balance that shows both activity payments and balance,1great app the quick pay feature for business purposes keeps my business running smoothly the direct deposit feature keeps me going efficiently without skipping a beat as a mom grad student wife and business owner this is my most used app and reason to bank with chase,1the app is quick and user friendly you can get everything done same as on a desktop from checking your sales to your rewards  as always chase is great in showing pending sales if you want to keep an eye on possible fraudulent charges before they go through,1i have a number of apps for banks i use and this app is definitely the best i have used  it makes all of my banking needs easy as can be  i read a bad review and it sounded like the person either has no idea what they are talking about or the dont bank properly  i have never ever been locked out by this app and have been using it for about  years,1i love the chase app especially  running a business and having clients that have chase its quick easy and free and not complicated to get the info you need asap saves so much time when i dont have time to get to the bank and deposit checks i can do it right online and the next business day its available to me,1i have banked with chase for eight years and i have been pleased with their mobile app i set up my mortgage payment through there and was able to pay several bills while away on business overseas i am pleased to see the bank upped the transferable maximum amount of money because that was a hinderance all in all its a productive app,1i have been using the chase mobile app since they released it years ago and it has been fantastic deposit checks transfer money check balances and individual transactions  from anywhere i rarely use the website any more thank you chase for making my life easier,1i recently downloaded the chase app and found its functionality to first rate    moving between accounts couldnt be easier and the user interface allows me access to every aspect of my account that one would have on a desktop website    a great app for those on the go even internationally,1touch id instead of password every time check scan paper check to deposit fab check all account balances and activity bill pay quick pay to any email transfer funds between accounts set up alerts to monitor activity now if only we could get decent interest on our money,1i am ecstatic to be able to deposit checks move money without leaving home  i would like to see a running balance for my checking or is it there and i cant find it and reading the posts about the lack of touch screen with the new update  is that   i have yet to install because i have yet to hear anything positive  this just adds to my negative list,0whenever i try to deposit a check it doesnt recognize the account number andor routing number and when i manual fix it and press submit it says to go to a branchatm to make deposit this is a really big inconvenience and wish it could get fixed also i used to be able to do fingerprint login and now it doesnt do that and i wish it would come back i do enjoy the easiness to go between my different accounts but please fix these other issues thanks,1i have been using this app for a few years now it has always been very reliable from locating the nearest atm to depositing a check via taking a photo it has always been easy and convenient to access my money whenever and wherever thank you for providing great service time and time again,1i love this app it has all the features i need and works well most of the time im an it professional maintenance must be done on apps timing is never convenient therefore i never say an app is bad because it may be temporarily unavailable for updating this app transfers  shows latest purchases etc what most could you want i love it,1this app is so amazing   love the fact that i can check the acct transfer money pay bills easy access to what i need  love that i have my statement on line being able to see my checks   with the alerts i know whats going on in my acct   you have a problem with your acct there one phone call away an they are right on top of the problem   stars,0i will be leaving chase soon this app is not dependable chase charges me a service fee every month because i am selfemployed and do not have direct deposit when i do try to deposit checks from my phone i experience a a reoccurring issue where i get an error message stating that the image of my check is not clear enough i reinstall the app try taking pictures again to no avail chase troubleshooting has no idea why the app doesnt work and just tell me to reinstall it again i guess i wont be missing chase when i move my money to a credit union,1functional banking app although menu navigation is cumbersome amp not intuitive biggest gripe constant updates there is no reason an app needs a mandatory update every  weeks unless money will get immediately siphoned out of my account by hackers dont make updates mandatory its an infrequently used app used for  sec at a time being forced to spend a few minutes updating just about every time i need to use is infuriating never convenient,1this app has made banking a breeze i highly recommend it to everyone that banks its chase that wants a simple way to check balances get alerted for all types of things deposit checks from your phone transfer money from your phone anything you can pretty much do in a bank in the palm of your hands,1i really cant top what others have written however i use this app at least every other day for keeping track of my bills to pay my home loan and it is all so easy and everything is set up so sensibly that anyone can use it with either no or little looking through the app to understand it thank you chase,1what i noticed right away is the ease to make an online check deposit before my check photos would not come out right the first time gotta hold my breath when taking pictures on both sides of the check but now its much faster to deposit a check online than going to a chase bank teller,1i believe we are rating the functionality of the app not the bank or its policies the app is great to get balance information or transfer funds the only issue is alerts when i have an alert and go to alerts in the menu it defaults to my credit card even if the alert is on my checking account i really like having the ability to set alerts to fit my needs,1i frequently get alerts on the chase app  however due to the fact that i have multiple accounts whenever i open the app i never know where the alert is coming from because the app defaults to one main account every time  please adjust alerts so that correct account loads for the given alert the other piece that is missing deals with quick pay now that chase automatically deposits quick pay payments it would be very helpful to be able to change the default quick pay account in the mobile app so many times ive had business funds go into wrong accounts and it jumbles my accounting please fix this outside of this the app functions properly,1app is easy and functionality clear to operate chase customer service is friendly skillful knowledgeable force and always settled my needs in one call my only problem with chase is not having brick and mortar presents in n virginia and greater dc metro area thanks for everything have a prosperous new year  be fair and balanced youre better than bank of america and definitely wells fargo,1as a longtime customer i cant help but marvel at how chase manages to stay ahead of the curve it is interesting to see how they stay so far ahead of the competition having held accounts at all of the major banks i can safely say chase is the best when it comes to technology and innovation for the customer ease of use constant improvement and reliability well done chase,1negative reviews are the only confusing thing i see thats wrong with this app everything is fast and easy to access alerts allow you to take action fast before fees hit most negative reviews i see are based on the assumption that they have no clue how to use a smartphone or are not technically inclined,1ive been with chase for  yrs or so amp have been using app since ive had a smart phone which is  yrs now in this amount of time ive never had  complaint about chase i would highly recommend chase amp this app to everyone i know amp dont know you can check your account  hrs a day and its so easy to do amp very clear to understand,0i recently signed up for a chase credit card amp so i thought i should give the app a try my primary bank is boa amp i have been using their app for years the boa app is much more user friendly the chase app is not as easy to navigate amp im still not sure where everything is at first i thought the home screen had not loaded all the way but its just blank which is unappealing to the eye as well as a waste of space its clear that chase does not pay much attention to their app because its just horrible,1there is nothing wrong with the app itself its actually really convenient to use and really easy to use the only problems that i have are with the card itself and the new chip not working properly  chases customer service could be a lot better too but since this review was about the app i gave it five stars,1i appreciate all the features that chase has added to this app over the years i remember they were the first to have the mobile deposit feature  i loved the quick look at my account balances and even though i can log in with touch id now i have  super fast options to access my account balances ,1what did we do before smart phones and technology we drove to the bank we mailed checks we did everything that took time money gas and effort this app makes it easy to make deposits transfers and everything i would normally see a teller to do this app is very intuitive and easy to use definitely recommend,0this app periodically turns off touch id also chase will frequently not recognize my password forcing me to reset password and come up with crazier and harder to remember passwords with more and more ridiculous requirements letter number caps i get it silly symbols no consecutive numbers no repeating digits in the password ffs if youre going to keep making me reset it stop changing your requirements its the only option however and itll let you see your balance when it decides to let you see your own accounts,1dear chase when you update the app i wish i could at least make one payment before forcing me to download the new version i dont understand technology though so maybe thats impossible i feel antsy as i wait to pay otherwise its easy to use keep up the great work but do take dvantage of future advances in payment interruption prevention,1i dont really have anything bad to say about the app so far i havent had any major problems and ive had the app a few weeks after chase came out with it the slightly annoying problems ive have experience theyve corrected through updates glad when the touch id was added a little bumpy in the beginning but works great so far like the new updates,1app is very user friendly i do not have any issues when in need of transferring money to other accounts i did notice that sometimes i am not prompted to use touch id and therefore required to enter my password i am wondering if that happens to others as well overall i am very pleased with the new update i am able to see things in a more organized manner which is very helpful,1this app has worked in the way i needed it to i like that i can access multiple accounts and pay my bills from the app makes it so much easier to get a payment out quickly also a big fan of quickpay it lets me share money with friends and family when its needed right away,1the mobile app is very useful  mobile alerts help you keep up with your account activity  however it should be easier to get to your alerts  i have multiple accounts and the account showing on the alerts screen is never the one that has an alert and i have to go to each account to figure out which one has the alert,1the app is good for what i use it for  a quick look into my bank account and money transfers i love the new improvement with the touch id making it much easier to access my account even if i dont remember the password and that i can just tap the touch id fingerprint versus having to close and reopen the app just to start it tldr  i love the app remodel touch id integration is awesome and keep on up the good work,1super user friendly and easy to navigate incredibly grateful for the realtime updates too thanks to this app i was able to stop an unauthorized withdrawal as it was happening still not sure how someone got hold of my information but regardless the notification of a suspicious withdrawal saved me from losing nearly ,1this app has many of useful features its simplified smooth navigational transitioning to amp from its multiple features leaves no room for frustration amp little room for error i really love the convenience in the ability to deposit checks right from the app now if youd kindly deposit one million dollars into my account id truly be thankfully  delighted mrs h,0finally they update the app to be native but copypaste for the password isnt supported i have a complex password that is stored securely very difficult to remember or type correctly this app wont remember my password and wont even let me paste it init does find atms which is nice but that is about it i doesnt let you enter a pin or something so i dont have to enter my password each timeit is very long and difficult to type on my phone i hope chase updates the app to be truly iphone compatible soon,1i wont give it a  star rating only because i dont use all the functions this app has  what i have used i was very happy with  if all the functions work as well it is worth a  staryes it has asked for verification after  app update and  phone updates but i would rather do that every once in a while than worry if the security is good  it shows me i can relax just alittle bit when using this app,1for my needs this app works perfectly its nicely designed and very easy to use i would read the reviews to make sure there arent features you are expecting that this app doesnt have but i mainly use it to check my balance and pay my credit card bill and it does those things with aplomb,1not bad pretty much works as expected one thing devs when using the atmbranch locator it only lists the atm closest to me not the branch that is about a half mile more down the road it seems if you need a branch you have to go through the contact us page and click on branch then input your current location if you could set up the locator to include up to say  atmbranchs from closest to farthest that would be a big plus ,1finally chase adds iphone  retina display compatibility i love the chase mobile banking app but ever since the iphone  arrived lots of people have been asking for retina display support its finally here with version  thank you chase for finally adding retina display support to the app plus the notifications for your iphone is a great addition as well,1deposited  check via quick deposit with no problems able to do everything over the app such as transfer checking to savings bill pay and such easy to use and handy for whenever i want my balance prob wont ever leave chase cause its about the only good banking app comparing to most of the banking apps out there,1app is running marvelously and i love the instant access to my credit card transactions i have not encounters any problems that other reviews have mentioned and am very happy with it i connected through app to speak with someone which i was able to do however that person was in india  would have given five stars if i had dealt with an american and i assume that for future calls ill be connected to a foreigner,0this app does not work bottom line i do keep up with ios updates and chase app updates it never logs in i used to be able to get in a year ago and have since reinstalled the app twice to no avail it will tell you if you type the password incorrectly so its connecting to something but when typed correctly it will load forever and never go to account details i guess i shouldnt say never since it does work on rare occasion about every  tries i also have the app on my ipad and experience the same thing not sure why the app is even available,1before the last update i had the same problems as other reviewers  i could log in and sometimes see balances but pretty much everything else was nonfunctionalnow the app works just fine i can log in check balances make or schedule payments and navigate the other menus without problems,0literally downloaded this for the check photo deposit feature alone has never worked to successfully deposit the check not even once it gives me every single error message it can possibly conceive to refuse my check things that dont even make sense like the amount that i entered does not match the amount on the check yes yes it does exactly the photos as clear as possible on a well lit pristine check itll give me different error message every time its complete bs hey at least thats one thing thats consistent about chase is a bank,1lets me do almost anything i can do at the bank still have to go to bank to transfer funds into my ira account but that is some what understandable also large check deposits where one check is over  i think must be done at bank love the fact i can do these things anywhere my phone has a signal of g or better,1before you could literally so nothing with the chase app but check balances accept money the bare basics but with this new app there is much more to be done without the typical desktop the new interface makes it easier to use and the addition of checking your secure messages is much better i love this app  more than the past one,1this is a necessary app if you use chase and have a smartphone you can deposit checks set up minimum account balances and pay all of your bills you can set up your chase account to pay your bills instead of giving your account information to all of the companies you do business with so your account is more secure,1ive been using this app for years and love it i especially love the alert feature that i can customize you can get an alert when a direct deposit is made a large withdrawal occurs and many more transferring money is so easy and quick i use that feature often to do business out of multiple accounts,1i recently got it without the knowing of what would happen on it but im able to check my account whenever and i like that you have to sign in every time because it makes me safe feeling that no one can just view my account theyd have to hack it or something which is incredibly rare i like the app and i would suggest it to anyone,0as others have pointed out the check depositing portion of the app does not work any more  the check deposit function is the main reason ive used the app in the past  if it cant work for depositing checks then the app is of little value to me   i have an apple iphone s  others with a different phone may find that it works for them  its been at least a couple weeks since i was able to use it  it should be an easy fix  so whoever the developer is please fix it,1ive been using chase for my banking for over years now they really understand customers needs and conveniences to get things done quickly as first priority easy to navigate chase app and pay bills quick pay is so convenient to transfer money among family and friends now you can use touch id to access chase app securely,1i honestly love this app it is so easy to use and convenient i use the app all the time its fast up to date and anything you could ask for in a back app or app in general you can do so many things from your phone transfer money change your settings i comment chase for making this app so easy to use its sleek and professional,1i use this app just about every day i can deposit my checks as soon as i get them but my favorite feature is that i can check balances without logging in just a simple swipe and you know exactly how much money is in each account  the site is easy to navigate and bill pay and money transfers are simple  love it,1i find it truly amazing that i can manage not only my personal account from my phone but i can also manage my business account as well with ease i can quickly deposit checks on the spot transfer funds and pay bills without one hiccup a great bank with great resources and up to date technology,1this app is definitely very convenient it lets me do everything related to my own accounts easily and quickly on top of that im able to check points on my credit card and use them from here my only complaint is that youre not able to instantly transfer money to someone elses account pilkingtons app can do that i dont see why chase shouldnt otherwise its a great app,1this app makes my life infinitely simpler i can make payments transfer funds pay bills and make deposits from wherever i am in the world from my living room on li to a cafe on cobblestone streets of prague i can take care of  of my banking needs  if you could only figure out how i could access my safe deposit box it would be ,1at first this app was mediocre but then they added a few amazing features like the finger print login and the swipe right feature to see your balance i really love how easy the quikpay feature is as well all around and amazing app that helps me keep up with my banking without the hassle of having to find a computer or go to the bank ,1its good does everything it should however ive told it to remember me but still once i leave the app amp return even if its only been a minute of exiting the app i have to relog on this wouldnt be such a big deal if it didnt take so long to load but sometimes it takes forever anyways if that could be fixed this app would be perfect because it is easy to use amp understand see my deposits amp withdrawals,1i like this app i only have a chase credit card no bank accounts but i like the swipe preview so i can quickly see what my balance is while waiting in line for example other bank apps i have it is required to log in to see your credit card balance but not regular account balances nice features good looks,1under the credit card section when i clicked current balance it showed the list of transactions and when i clicked credit card  it used to show statement balance current balance available credit and credit limit now clicking both will give me the list of transactions why the change please change back,1as a credit card only customer my abilities within this app are definitely limited but one thing that really needs to be improved is touchid its great that we can use this to sign in now but touchid should give you access to everything its a secure log in process so why must i still enter my password to pay my bill come on chase every other big bank allows this touchid  no password capital one does it discover does it lets go chase,1i have os have no problems with the print reader the app has been working fine since it first came out i like the fact that my fingerprint wont get into the account i dont want anyone using my fingerprint to access my accounts if im incapacitated the password to access my account is just plain common sense security but then im just an idiot,1i have several accounts from different banks to manage i downloaded wf cb co and chase of all this is the most user friendly i was so frustrated with the other apps i ended up deleting them all ill just stick to online banking for other banks i like its touch id option unlike other users i havent encountered any problem accessing my account using touch id,1i do everything with this app im always checking my balance helps keep track whats been spent and how much i have left i hate the background that they have now tho i also hate my debit reward point system is there even tho they stopped that system i hate inconsistency all minor things wont stop me from giving them a  star,1out of the countless apps i have on my phone this is the one that im sure i use the most it keeps me informed on anyall transactions up to the second its extremely easy to transfer funds from one chase account to another and the quickpay feature i think is the greatest invention since fireif you have a chase account and you dont have this app make sure you download it youll thank me later ,1thank you chase for making life that much easier i can deposit checks transfer money and manage my accounts quickly whats more is that any time a security issue has come up the company has been sure to report and protect my account although that is more about the company than the app,1ive been very happy with my chase online banking app it just makes life so much easier when u can do things without having to go to the bank and when its so easy to navigate i would not mess around with anything confusing when it comes to my money and this the opposite of confusing very clear and easy to understand,0i was so excited for touch id to be added to the app but they added a requirement to enter your password to do anything other than view balances i use a long random password via password and have to enter the app to get my password before coming into the chase app this is what i was doing before touch id support and was hoping to i wouldnt have to do this anymore you dashed that hope i understand the security involved but thats what touch id is forthe password requirement defeats the purpose of touch id support,1everything about the app is so user friendly the touch id is such a convenient way to log on you can access all accounts transfer money quickpay friends and family pay bills and more all in one app its user friendly and updated regularly the best banking app chase stays ahead of the game and i love the progression,1i really like the app because it is convenient but one thing i am upset is that i already had three times since i have downloaded that bank wasnt available to be accessed due to maintenance or something else i wish it wasnt so often  thankfully it wasnt an emergency when i tried to use an app or i would be furious,1simple but attractive ui with everything generally functioning as it should ive been using the app for at least a year now and i think ive only once ever gotten an error message from it and that was quite some time ago i love that i can scan checks to deposit them rather than making a trip to the bank,1i really love this app because it makes life easier i can deposit checks pay bills manage my account and send money to people from my phone at any time without having to log in to multiple apps or accounts the interface is simple and easy to use there is nothing to dislike,0ive had a couple problems with the app since ive gotten it twice ive been locked out of my account because of too many incorrect password attempts on the app when i use touch id i then have to call chase and change my password each time and theyve told me everytime that this has happened that there had been no unusual activity so it basically keeps locking me out of my account and making me change my password for no reason,1this is the most reliable app on my phone to date its quick and gets better with every update no steps backwards taken suggestion you guys should make a notification for whenever there is a deposit to your account only think i get notified for is when money gets taken out should be viceversa as well,1this is by far the best financial services iphone app that ive used it is userfriendly functional and most of all professional i never need to jump on the laptop anymore with the various capabilities of this app you can pay your credit card view statements earn and cash in rewards and more great job chase,1this app is pretty standard bankingapp fair and works well chase is an awesome bank and i love itthe only thing i could ask for would be the ability to add text message alerts to my account from the app as i no longer have a computer available to use but that isnt even a huge deal to me,1in the truest sense this app mirrors the experience on the web i agree with others about the messages and notifications being a little clumsy but i feel the same about the design on the web  anyway for core banking functions the app works paying bills is super easy transferring money is a breeze and depositing works as expected,1ive used this app for several years i deposit checks pay credit card bills and transfer money between my checking and savings the only glitch ive ever encountered was the touch id feature to login which i never got to work i just type in my password instead absolutely essential app for banking wth chase,1my use is limited since i only have a chase credit card but i prefer the app to my other two financial institutions  love the apple thumb identification instead of changing and forgetting both my log in and password for other banks i clearly see charges and payments love the auto alerts for charges i make,1all bank apps do basically the same things its just a matter of how fast and easily it gets you to where you want chase has made a very quick responsive app that quickly gets you right to where you want to be and being able to use touch id to see your accounts makes it so much quicker,1although we all dont like seeing when our numbers are hitting those low digits or even worse when flatlined or under the bar  i love having to be able to access everything i need straight from the app without having to call in or go to the bank itself saves me an abundance of time that i must account for love this app ,1this is a great app if i have to move money from my checking to my savings or vise versa things couldnt be easier ive been with chase for a long time and i hope to continue to receive all the benefits i currently have and more their in house banking drive up teller banking and atm services far exceed any other bank ive dealt with i love this bank,1this app is probably my favorite part of banking with chase i mean the company is great with their low rates and amazing customer service but there are just some days where you dont want to get up to deposit a check or move stuff around your accounts hey you might now even want to speak to a human for the day no worries the chase app has got your back,1love it the updates have made it easier to use and the interface is nice my favorite parts of the app are the fingerprint sign on and the ease of making transfers i also like being able to make deposits with taking a photo of my check basically i can do all the banking possible outside of physically going to the bank,1this app makes my life sooo much easier so far it has been glitchfree and easy to use i love that i am able to deposit checks right into my banking account without making a trip to the actual bank chase has embraced technology the customer service is always excellent and i havent had a problem yet keep up the great work chase,1i like chases app the ability to swipe right to see balances is handy transferring money from one account to another and billpay are great too the only reason i gave it  stars and not  stars is they dont have biometric login we also bank with usaa their app allows fingerprint and facial recognition login that being said everything else about chase is better than usaa especially the customer service,1i thought this app was great until i tried capital one app simple reason easier to get the  earned cash back on the credit card to be deposited into a checking account only a click away i would love to see them change that also the cash back earned on capital one shows right away with chase you have to wait a month to see it in online banking ,1once set up you can easily manage your account my card has been stolen before and it was easy to manage what purchases were not mine and get them removed also easy way to see other accounts and check your points only suggestion is a thumb login instead of the password everytime otherwise great app,1i would give it  stars if it allowed access to credit report like some bank cards and more importantly it would be great to allow you to tell chase if you plan on traveling and the statescountries you visit this would save on a phone call to them other than that its basically there to show you balance,1i love this app it has everything i need i can pay all my bills through this app and keep up to date with my account the alerts are perfect for when i need to know if my balance is low or if my paymentschecks have posted i get all my statements at the touch of a finger literally the touch id is amazing and makes things very easy,1i love being able to deposit checks from home and the recognition software is excellent and rarely misreads handwriting the alert functionality is not at all intuitive i see that there is an alert yet must hunt through each account and through messages to find it during the process i often accidentally logout due to placement of logout tap which is next to the switch account tap,1ive been with chase for a few years now  and have previously been with other banks i find chase to be so much more userfriendly  the app is very convenient i pay all my bills through it and when ive had issues and had to go into the bank the staff is been extremely helpful recommend it highly,1the chase banking app works well and is simple to use i like that you are able to deposit checks and send and accept money through the app  this app definitely makes banking much easier  i use it for almost all of my banking and all of my accounts are visible and linked  makes life on the go much easier thanks chase,0the app is a good start but falls short of app expectations for example it should provide a better way see the details of an individual transaction  also it should be a way to configure alerts on the iphone instead of having to do this on the website  next the app should support touch id because it has been apart of the iphone since iphone s  in short the development team needs to do a better at adopting the technologies of cocoa touch to create a world class experience for their customers,1love this app super quick and easy for when you need to transfer money over from one account to another transfers are immediate and you can also deposit checks from home takes a little longer to actually go thru but it saves you a trip highly recommend this app for anyone who banks with chase,1no complaints has done everything i can think of i need done except dispense cash like that all my accountscheckingsavingcredit cardare in  place also that my daughters accounts are there so i can transfer money or remind when theyre getting low chase pay is good too pay the tutor through it very convenient,1does everything i need it to do and then some rarely go to the bank unless it is absolutely urgent there are sometimes where the app goes under maintenance and some of the features like quickpay send money to people instantly is not functional but that is to be expected overall great app well integrated with ios good job to the ios programmers at chase,1ive been using the chase app for years the only problems ive had are with check deposits thru the phone it can sometimes be challenging to get a good enough picture to deposit checks through the app although this could be the check itself however ive had no issues since i upgraded to the iphone s,1this app is really good and quite secure  keep up the good work  there are times ive encountered discrepancies in balance info between actual balance and what shows on app  computer access or going in to bank is always accurate  still giving  star rating but please make sure app is able to accurately access all banking info,1at less than a year i have been using the chase bank account banking application and it has worked pretty well and has the security features working with it just like the website and old fashioned telephone automated as well as customer service representative support does it seems fairly very stable considering most things go averagely well and errors are self corrected pretty quickly and cleanlyjoshua alexander mcnair,1ive never liked going to the bank since the invention of online banking i have dealt with several big name banks and a few different bank apps it just has to be said that in my humble opinion chase is my favorite i have not ever had a problem with any portion of the app i use it at least twice a day and usually more  i love you chase app people,1this app is everything you can hope for its easy to log in with the new fingerprint login easy to navigate i especially like that you can see all of your accounts on the home page transferring money has never been easier and depositing checks i havent been to an actual bank in years,1been with chase about  years now this app lets me do everything i need to quickly and with minimal jumping around  love the deposit check part and being able to transfer money quickly from one account to another  have very little trouble with the app except middle of the night when they do updates  lol,1this is a super friendly and easy to use app i just left the store after using my chase card and sign email that my account was overdrawn  pulled out the phone open up the app transfer money from savings to checking   problemsolving all in less than two minutes thats what i call awesome customer service  thanks chase,1this app gives you all youll need from your credit card online account i love the touch id it makes it very safe to use as touch id is the safest form of a password you can find everything you need from within the app  stars for sure a lot of thought went in to making it user friendly,1chase has made it possible in my opinion to bank using only your smartphone or tablet   deposit checks   take a picture of the check  done   pay bills   theres a menu for that whether its a one time or monthly bill   since theyve added touchid capability  its made using the app that much easier,1i can take care of almost everything on my app so i dont always need to access my computer its great when im on the run and need to check accounts or even deposit a check with a photo i love it and use it every day im able to send myself notifications from the app regarding my balances too its perfect thank you for this app,0this app is completely useless  the first time i tried to use it it showed that i have a checking and a savings account but both were greyed out so i couldnt deposit a check in either account  after logging out and then back in to the phone the app was grudgingly willing to let me deposit a check in my savings account but not my checking account which is what i wanted  i tried it anyway after following all the instructions it gave me an error message which provided no details about what went wrong  needless to say ive deleted this pos,1i am a blind user i love this app because im not expected to obtain sighted assistance identifying a picture just to see how broke or rich i am  this chase bank app allows me to enter a password and my information is still safe  ive used other apps from financial institutions and i had to click on images and all that nonsense i can use this app,1if you bank w chase this is a musthave  i quickly easily and immediately deposit checks whenever they are received saving me a trip to the atm also use it to pay bills and transfer money between accounts and to keep track of balances highly recommend,1i just have a credit card with chase but this app allows me to do everything i need for that account i especially like that when making a payment on the card one option is the full amount from the last statement so i dont have to go back and look that up my main banks app does not do that,1ive always loved the ease and speed of this app i check my balance in seconds mostly right before a transaction  i love the updates too its a clean look with the simplest navigations because of the chase app the most complicated transfers payments and deposits are made easy and are getting better and more fun to do,1i really love that i can set up my future paymenti had missed a couple of if payments and i am always on time with everything elsethis option give me peace of mind no more worries if i have set up the next payment i receive an email telling me the date and amount i have scheduled easy as piethanks so much,1this app is great ive had other apps from other banks and they dont hold a candle to this one you can make deposits with a picture of the check check your balances transfer money from your money accounts to credit cards you have with chase etc ive had the app for years and i love it,1i like that you can easily pay bills transfer money deposit checks and see all your accounts i used to complain you cant search a merchant through the cc details and then it got even worse now every time a statement is ready all the charges are gone and can only be seen in the statement  annoying before recent update you could see a month or two charges irrespective of statements it was so much more useful,1ive used this app since i got my chase acct  years agoand it gets better with every update  i am very busy so the things that i can do with this app when im on the go is timesaving and simple to complete  thank you chase  now my  children both have chase so i can send them money quickly securely and easily,1ive been really happy with the app especially since i can now use finger print option i use the app a lot for depositing checks although you do want to double check routing and account numbers because signatures that over those numbers are hard for the app to read otherwise works really well,0the ui for this app is a bit lacking most users want to login and be able to see basic account information what is most important to them the main account page only displays balance so much more useful information could be added here ie payment due date and short listing of recent transactions or available credit there is so much waste of space when it can be used more effectively the app is not very user friendly at all ps please dont raise my apr for this review  as a proud member im only trying to help in improve the app,1i can see all of my monies right from the app and can do maybe  of the things ive wanted to do from either my phone or ipad  well designed and flushed out  i havent experienced any glitches or bugs in my + years in this app which is what i expect from the company that i entrust to keep my money handled  solid app keep it up,1ive had nothing but good experiences using the chase app i mostly set up the checking amp savings for direct deposit to make sure i always could quickly and easily pay my chaseunited visa but it soon became a good method of paying other bills online and depositing incoming checks ive found it to be easy to use and full featured,1easy to use with my iphone so much better since the new update where i can now use touch id to access the apps full capabilities without having to re enter my password to pay my bills and deposit checks etc such an improvement chase thanks for listening to your valued customers,1the app is for the most part okay the ui is unintuitive but it does serve its purpose i do like how easy it is to use chase quickpay however one thing i dont like is that once you cancelled the touch id prompt there is no way to sign in without either inputting the password or going out and in of the app there should be a touch id button to trigger the touch id sign in if it has been cancelled to look at the account preview,1i have tried multiple mobile banking software apps and investigated others this app is so convenient i really like the instant text notification of debit card purchases on my phone they usually appear while standing at the register and i can compare the receipt and the text for confirming amounts,1i bank at several financial institutions amp i have to say chases mobile app is at the top because of all the features it offers such as detailed transactions including pending amp the ability to deposit checks by phone to name a few its clear chase is definitely making investments in technology amp customers are  benefitting from it keep it up,1overall its a great app very simple and straight forward the only thing i wish was better is the touch id to log into the app with citibank its instant as soon as u open the app put your finger and your logged in with chase u have to wait a minute or just put in the password manually but again its a well designed and put together app,1this app is super convenient i can log in using touch id i get notifications when my balance is below a certain amount i can instantly check my account balance deposit checks amp check purchase history within seconds the app has never crashed or had any problems all in all very reliable,0first of all the app feels very web like  its like they just built a javascript based app and wrapped it in a native shell  yes we can all tell the difference between apps like this and native apps about half the time when i launch the app it tells me i have to go resetup touch id  why cant this app remember i set that up  also i have all of the rotating to deposit checks  the app doesnt support rotating until you deposit a check and then it forces you to rotate horizontal and back  fix both of these please,1the app and now the website does not show a running balance with each transaction this is inconvenient especially since the statement balance does not reflect payments made after the statement date to know how much is still owed for a given month i would have to manually account for all transactions and payments after that date whereas a running balance would make this unnecessary,1couldnt be easier can online deposit checks  super user friendly format only negative i could fathom would be from a user who isnt technologically savvy i love this app and how it helps me perform my banking needs  couldnt see how i would make it better  no way this app deserves the  stars thats on the average ,1wow  i havent experienced any of the difficulties others reported with using the app  the touch id works every time for me  i do however find it annoying that for my chase visa posted transactions disappear rather quickly and i have to wade through statements to find them  the atm visa transactions do not do this nor the savings account  i find this app superior to those for other bank accounts i have,1this app is great it gives me alerts when my account is low or transactions over a certain amount has taken place this helps me not to overdraft my account when a large sum has been removed i get an alert so if someone has fraudulent being in my account l can immediately call the bank,1i use this app almost daily i have business and personal accounts that i have linked so i can conduct business on both with one log in i can check balances make payments to my chase cards from my account look at statements the information is pretty up to date with my balance its easy and user friendly,1ive always used the app for the simple things like checking balances and such and it has always worked well  one thing that i would like to see implemented in the future would be person to person paymentsmoney transfers like services like venmo and google wallet offer,1i like the app as it is of quality just like chases service just what i expect out of a bank app complains  the app wont let me deposit certain gov checks and thats fustrating  it doesnt show account balance next to withdrawsdeposits ex ive a  remaining balance on my credit card and i made a payment recently but i doesnt indicate how much i had left right after my payment,1this app is a tremendous help when it comes to managing the accounts i have for my kids and myself i can keep track of their spending and deposit extra money into their counts its helpful to be able to look at my businesspersonal account whenever i want and especially on the go,1relationships matter ive been with chase over  years and though theres always room for improvement chase just keeps gets better especially with this app makes book keeping quick and easy also unlike some other banking apps chase mobil app updates quickly for their customers,1this app is amazing i use it all the time to transfer money pay my credit card and to deposit checks the only thing that got in the way was the app review reminder when trying to use my finger to scan in the option would go away after the review reminder other then that it is awesome,1the app has a lot of functionality and i am able to do most banking actions on it the only reason i gave it  stars instead of  is that periodically i have to type in my password again not a huge deal but it always happens when i am in a hurry and need to do something on the road then im locked out until i can get back home and look up my password its a huge inconvenience,1i only use this app to pay my mortgage i dont bank with chase at all ive used it for years now and havent had any issues at all but here recently ive noticed a very fast response once i select what i want its almost like having broadband internet with blazing speed easy fast and convenient thats always a plus,1the interface is super simple to use and it shows all of your transactions like they do online but its less cluttered and easier to read i love using the check scanner since i often put off and forget to go to an atm to physically deposit a check and that way i can keep the check for personal paper records,1i love this app ive read other reviews where people state that they have problems i dont have problems i use the deposit check function a lot and have never had a problem i use this app daily to keep an eye on my credit card balances if you have problems delete the app and download it again,1this is the best banking app ive ever used  i switched from my local bank to chase because i have a work commute and could never make it to my bank on time  i can do everything on my phone now from depositing checks to transferring between accounts and sending my wife and other chase account holders money  great app,1i really do like this app and its great features i find it to be so easy to navigate i truly enjoy being able to customize my notifications not only is it easy to use but its very helpful much better than the other banking apps       compared to the other mobile banking apps chase bank mobile app is the best ever yet you go chase bank,1although updates keep things secure its aggravating when the chase app requires  updating i wish i have received notification that the update is waiting before logging in and being that notified of the update and then having to login again quite the hardship i know but it is the only thing thats contrary to using this great app,1ive been in the banking world as an employee for over  years but not any longer i have to say chase is progressive technologically and they have great customer service at my branch on elston in chicago but i love that i can just do all my banking from home especially since i am disabled and its difficult for me to get out making a deposit from my couch priceless,0this app has some great features like mobile check deposit ability to make transfers pay bills etc it was rather disappointing though because over half of the time it wont even let me sign in saying that the app is currently unavailable the mobile check deposit feature has not worked for me for over a year now it is actually pretty useless to me as of late because of these issues i am thinking about switching banks,1i have been using the chase app for awhile now and really think it is easy to use saves me trips to the bank easy to check balances transfer funds and send money to people only occasionally do i have to retake photos when depositing checks but when i change to a darker background it usually always works,1very user friendly ive been using quick pay since my daughters were in college and it was always very easy to use even then my daughters bank with chase and it makes our life so much easier the one new add on feature for checking your fico score is a bit complicated but im working on figuring it out,1ive been using this chase app for many years now its the best that i have found in my life i had many different banks but also many problems ive been with chase since they were washington mutual i will never leave them they provide great service and great knowledge to the customers needs thank you chase bank for all your great help,1accurate easy to use likewise sapphire credit card provides easy to understand terms incredible benefits and helpful english speaking customer service staff however when card was compromised and handed over to chases fraud department the numerous reps that i spoke with over several weeks were not reliable and talked in circles they failed to followthrough on promises made  in a later conversation a customer service rep suggested that i always demand to only speak with us chase representatives,1for on the go users this is a great app  balances history transfers pay bills locations with gps even wire transfers what more can you ask for  thats why its called mobile banking not online banking its a snapshot of the things we can do online but through our iphone   lets all be happy that were able to do this and its free,1i check my balance like twice a day even if i dont buy anything haha so im very happy to have that at the ready  i havent used the bill pay feature since i just prefer paying over the phone so i cant review that   also i would love to see my leisure reward points so maybe if you guys ever update this app you could toss in that feature too,1i like the app for a place to look at both my accounts  i just dont understand why there is a choice for my rewards when all it does is tell me to go to a diff site  when im on my account page online i can see my rewards details so why not here  its been this way since the beginning  i guess it doesnt matter for debit cards since those rewards are gone bc of barney frank,1this is a very put together app that does just about everything a mobile users wants find branchatm online bill pay funds transfer and of course check account balance i am sure there are more improvements on the way but basic functionality is all there nowanything more is an added bonus,1why does this app not allow me to quickly switch back and forth between my personal and business accounts  having to completely log out and log back in is annoying  if there are security concerns that necessitate that then at least make a shortcut or something  there has to be a way to preserve the security but making it more convenient for customer with multiple accounts,0deposit feature is nice but the majorissue is the keyboard bug that does not allow you to complete deposits or transactions once you input the numbers and click done the keyboard does not slide away and so you are stuck unable to submit or complete any tasks such a simple thing yet its been a problem for several versions nowupdate  extremely frustrating cant even schedule a credit card payment because it constantly crashes again its the keyboard pop up that causes this zero stars if i could,1i use my app everyday i signed up for alerts through text message so i always know whats going in with my account every morning i wake up to seeing the balance in my account so i always know whats there if you have ever been taken advantage of by a bank youd understand my fascination with notifications i say try if it if you havent yet,0this app is way better with some of the upgrades but it needs work on bill pay done or submit should be at the top instead of log out its just not the right place i cant tell you how many times after typing in the amount i go to look for the done button which is white and almost hiding but instead i go to the top where it says logout because that is green and makes sense please change this its taking way too much time when paying bills on the mobile app thanks,1i love the app it makes my life easy it saves me the trip to the bank there is only one thing i wish theyd change i have an external account linked to my chase accounts the mobile app will not allow me to make a money transfer to my external accounts i have to log onto my computer to do that thats the only thing that i dont like if it werent for this minor issue id rate the app  stars,1a good ap for keeping track of your credit card it gives current status and even alerts if you have unusual activity the only bad thing would be the lack of customer support if you need it that sends you to using your phone if there is an issue for a call kinda hard to review the account while talking to support and using the ap at the same time,1the upgrade fixed all the bugs i had been experiencing with this app and now it works great i also love seeing the chicago skyline whenever i log on because it reminds me of back in the day when chase was st chicago bank   keep up the great work  oh and i forgot to mention how very convenient it is to have your banking at your fingertips ,1the new version of this app functions way better than previous ones the interface is pretty and it is organized so that things are logically where youd expect to find them within the app i really like the added feature of being able to view the secure message center,1i appreciate this app it comes in handy when i need to check my account be notified when im below my budget deposit a check or transfer money however it crashes sometimes when im trying to deposit a check and it does hold information like my account number or routing number other than that it gets the job done this app is very convenient  ,1this bank is my favorite bank of all them and the app is the best i love how the keep becoming innovative and always updating it and adding new user friendly options  by far the check deposit is the best i commend chase for always providing  service and commitment to their customers ive never had a bad experience with u guys or ur service thanks,1love the convenience of  online banking very easy to check balances transfer money amp pay bills my only critique would be with managing alerts while i appreciate that they are fairly frequent amp accurate it is a rather tedious multi step process to be able to clear the alerts there has got to be a more efficient streamlined way to clear alerts other than that love the app amp the new look,1this is a great app  i have an i phone  and have never had a problem with iti can deposit my check by taking a picture and my account balance is always updated automatically and frequently usually right after i make any transaction great app for keeping track of my balances ,1i use this app a lot because it is my primary debit and checking account however it would be even better if you can allow account transfers through the mobile app for that i have to go to a laptop or onto the full chase website also please optimize the mobile app for the iphone  plus it looks weird having such large texts,1im so happy with the refinement of the app couldnt be any happier i dont know why everyone has bad things to say about this app i have no complaints nor have i ran into any problems while running the app and the swipe to preview your balances is also very helpful i have  other banking apps and non of them compare to the functionality of the chase app,1this app satisfies most if not all of my mobile banking needs and from my experience with the wells fargo mobile app is much superior however there are still things that can be improved upon touch id audible amp vibrating notifications ability to remove the badge app icon upon entering the app instead of having to sign in go to view alerts and select the specific account,0i just signed up for a chase account and started using this app so far its been a frustrating experience its not as userfriendly as my other bank apps surprisingly bofa even has automatic check deposit picture taking the most frustrating part of my experience is that it keeps having trouble with depositing a check it cant seem to detect the information on my check and tells me the numbered i entered is different from that on the check this app needs work,0we have seen updates after updates but little progress in user comfort the user direction in the message center remains confusing and uncomfortable mostly after more than half a year dont tell you adapted the app for the iphone + any banking app that still does not provide touchid login is simply outdated and not adapted to the iphone  you can link your chase visa to apple pay but cant log into the app using touchid if chase it managers think that makes any sense then jamie dimon must quickly replace his vp for it,1been waiting for this update for almost  years since touch id was released they have it now i can give my  star rating i have used almost every other major banks app on the app store at one point none of them from first hand experience come close to what chase has to offer and the simplicity of their overall experience,1ive had my chase card and app for a year or two now and i am most pleased with both the ease of use and accessibility with the app i can check my balances and pay my bill quickly and without any problemsalso with the rewards points i am amazing with all the options especially the itunes cards haha,1i absolutely loved the app until last week  updates started happening and now i am unable to transfer money  or dismiss alerts  or anything else  without getting the message error we are currently unable to complete this action  i also dislike how sometimes when i spend it doesnt appear on my app until later this makes it easier to accidentally overdraw  please fix the error message,1i am constantly on the go and i need an app that lets me see the state of my finances quickly and move money or pay bills on the fly  this app does that and more i get alerts on transactions that exceed my guild lines and pre established limits  all established by me  and can immediately see what hit my account  highly recommend both chase and this app,1this is one of the best apps out there  who would have thought years ago that you would be able to deposit your checks by taking a picture of them  i have been banking with chase for many years and this just one ups them in my book over all other banks  i probably use this app on a daily basis,1i remember just a decade ago or so having to call and dial through prompts just to get your bank balance now theres having to verify your identity of you log on from an unrecognized computer i love this app because you can bypass all of that its welldesigned and easy to use the touch security login feature just made it better,1no struggle to use no worrying over the reliability of it feel very secure when using it all the necessary things a banking app should bedownloaded it at the bank while setting up account only took a few minutes really appreciate this app makes it very easy to transfer funds from different accounts or pay rentutilities,1its extremely user friendly although i wish it would pending statement and  balance instead of available current balanceit can get confusing at times thinking you have more money also wish they would have a reminder set to make a deposit if you are overdrawn to make deposit before charging overdrawn charge,1i get a text message every time i spend moneyor money is taken out my account because it is constantly being updated i feel my account my information and my money is always safe and secure i have seen other bank apps and feel they are difficult to maneuver through the chase app flows with ease thank you chasev rodriguez,1i love being able to check my balance when you guys integrated the ability of being able to log in with our fingerprints i loved it my password is complicated so being able to simplify it with just a finger was awesome but now i hate how that doesnt even work anymore i put my finger and it just disappears so i have to put in my password why have that feature if it doesnt even work everything else is fine,1i enjoy using this appbank for its ease and convenience im busy and always on the go so paying bills while on the move is great for me  i also like the fact that after paying bills your true balance is reflected immediately  one improvement could be is to have a fingerprint sign it for faster access,1i remember back when i had to get to a phone call the bank  number and dial in all my account information just to get my balance i love being able to check my account from this app on the go or deposit a check any time i need to and the alerts when money is spent is a very helpful thing too great app,1this app is a mini bank teller for your iphone i love the addition of touch id my only gripe is the fact your are promoted to enter your password after logging in with touch id this is not necessary if some customers want this maybe make it an optional feature if chase wants an extra level of protection prompt for the touch id pw not the account pw,1i love the app for chase i use it to check my current balance and my recent activity i have also used the direct deposit a couple of times and it is great it is so quick and easy to deposit checks i love all of the new updates and the new look of the app the most easiest app to work with,1this app is great especially since the closest branch is a half hour from my home  the only complaint that i have is not being able to deposit checks online if you are overdrawn  thats when it should be readily available  its quite a pain to drive  minutes outoftown just to make a deposit,1this app makes life easy for this working mom of love it i have push notifications set so if anything is out of the ordinary i am notified the instant it occurs i can send amp accept quickpays amp deposit checks while sitting in traffic or brushing my teeth getting ready for work in the am  if you have to multitask amp want to stay on top of your finances then this app is a dream,1chase has made an app which is intuitive and helpful for the less tech savvy individuals like me i often am without internet and must use my phone for transactions there are very few functions that cannot be done from the phone and they are always improving the app to include new features great asset for customers,1of all the other mobile banking apps out there this app surpasses them all the flexibility and options that are provide it make banking much simpler and accessible when youre on the go i can practically do all my banking through the app short of it dispensing cash for me i highly recommend all chase customers to give it a try,1first of all great appone of the things i would change is when depositing a check through the phone when you take pictures you have to toggle backandforth instead of just clicking nexti would also add that feature of when youre done you can sign out and close the app,1this is such a convenience for me i love it feel secure and its so easy to do banking issues that back in the day took up your whole lunch hour either at the actual bank or later online now its amazing what can be done here a different world  makes those of us who are older and remember the hassles really appreciate it  great features thank you,1monitoring transactions making transfers managing credit cards and depositing checks from my phone works well recent increase in daily deposit limit helped  emails inviting me to sign in to read messages which i am unable to delete from the mobile is inconvenient so i just ignore them and let them pile up  they are no help to me usually a bank cya  the important stuff is texted to me anyway,0have been using this successfully for well over a year  months ago deposits that the app showed as successful did not appear in my account at first i thought it was my error but then i started doing screenshots and was able to verify it was a problem with the app for over  months this had happened with at least  checks now i take screen shots of every deposit and look on line to see if it appears in my account when i checked with chase they were neither sympathetic not apologetic and  suggested i go to bank to redeposit checks,1in updating my review i will still say that sending money with chase customers through quick pay has been so easy as well as to pay your credit card on here or to transfer money from checking and savings vice versa its smooth you can log in with touch id if you have an iphone with finger print scanner,1this site is fairly easy to use everything is labeled clearly so i really can maneuver around with no fuss also the site allows me to set up alerts for transactions above my set limits and these are quite accurate i was burned once by an erroneous withdrawal so set it up to avoid this also did the same with credit cards very easy site to use,1i think this is one of the only apps i have that hasnt frozen or crashed on me easy to use and navigate one improvement id like to see is when searching past transactions id like to be able to choose one payee and see history for just that one instead scrolling through all past transactions thank you,1this app is great i routinely check my transactions daily i have had no problems with it i honestly got an account for the  apr did not like that it was not clear that the free balance transfer period was only  days and then the  fee kicked in but i guess that was my own fault for not calling to verify before i confirmed the transaction overall i find the app excellent,1i normally like chase app  its clean and functional but not this time  why did you put your credit card advertisement on top of the screen  i dont use a big screen cell phone  so when i open your app i just want to see useful stuff not those stupid ad to eat my screen space  hate this part of the new app  i wish i didnt choose upgrade option this morning,1i have used this app quite a bit it is very easy to use and for most every day things it works very well one single complain is that the check deposit limit is only  usd this is occasionally a problem because i cannot use the app and have to make a visit to a chase bank location would love to see the limit increased to k or even k,1ive had this app for about a year now but as of a few weeks ago i can only get on it every once in awhile ill click on the app and itll just go back to my home screen every time but then sometimes it will let me get on but then it doesnt let me use my finger print anymore needs to be fixed,1i love the idea of a virtual bank this app allows me to handle all of my banking needs online theres also the ability to speak with customer service to resolve problems andor emergencies no matter what hour of the day it occurs im sure there will be even more innovative enhancements and customer focused services moving forward good job chase bank,1easy to use and i use it daily to check my account balances we no longer live near a chase bank so i use the app to deposit checks and transfer funds our new bank doesnt even offer an app for its business customers so i have kept the chase account for our personal finances just because of the app,1best banking app ive used compared to citibanks intuitive with a simple interface and paymentsdeposits post very quickly note when using for travel via ultimate rewards datestimes of scheduled flights will not be update in the app if there are schedule changes so you will need to visit the airlines site for updated itinerary,1this app is terrific fast easy bill pay transfer funds check balances and activity i have used the desktop version for a decade or more and as soon as i bought my first smartphone i was in love it i have also been able to count on amazing tech support needed exceeding rarely an absolute gem i wish all my apps ran so smoothly,1us banks are not known for their technological savvy please explain why paper checks still exist however this is one bank app that is sophisticated yet userfriendly i can do transfers pay bills check balances and make deposits in seconds no more wasting time driving to a bank and waiting in line chase youve set the bar,1this app is great for depositing checks via my phone its free i know of  other banks that charge  cents per check to do mobile deposits using their own app  very easy to transfer money between accounts and the quick pay feature is very fast and convenient also very happy with the app and chase,1this app is truly a time saver i got it specifically for depositing checks it continues to save me countless hours spent traveling to the bank to deposit checks it is friendly and usable for even me computer illiterate in every way it is also quick and gives me all the information i need when traveling with just my phone love it,1ive had accounts with several banks from td bank to bank of america to citi bank and none of them compare to the chase app they make things simple and accessible i love the transfer money and the depositing of the checks there are so many features one can use and just eliminates hassles all together this app definitely does not disappoint ,1its a great app i do all my transactions and payments on this app chase gives you all the tools you need to make banking easy and safe most importantly i dont need to run to the bank for every little thing like it was banking in the past im very excited to see what new features will be added to app next keep up the good work chase mobile app ,1i honestly love being able to check on my credit card balance and savings while on the road and with this app constantly updating and keeping uptodate with the latest in banking services i give it a  star it has never been so easy to access the information you need,1i recently moved our banking to chase coming from a regional bank to chase was the right move this app is excellent the previous update hit all the marks for excellence so far this version has been right on the money nice work chasethe app is easy to use i can check our account balance daily deposit checks and make transfers thanks chase,1for quickly paying a small number of bills i find the mobile app easier and faster than the full online browser based application   ditto for checking activity and transferring money  thats pretty much all i use this for so im happyps i dont deposit checks via the mobile app so i cant comment on that,1this app has made it a dream to bank from my phone thank you for the hard work and attention to detail the flow for transferring money between accounts is the only issue i have with the app it works great but sometimes when i want to click next i accidentally click cancel,1since the last update i had a few issues the touch id didnt work i had to delete and reinstall the app it works now also just called customer support because the quick pay option had a glitch when adding a comment it would not let me send the money  i erased the what is it for and then could send otherwise a good app hopefully they will resolve the glitches,1i have enjoyed using this app for yrs but hated the money transfer option because i had to relog in with my password after i was already logged in with my fingerprint since im constantly transferring money to my child in college this was an inconvenience now i dont have to do that anymore i have no problems with other parts of the app since i use it most to check balances and transfer money,1now with touch id access this app makes mobile banking very easy i seldom have to access my account on computer anymore i switch banking from wells fargo to chase and never looked bank this is what banking should be like now i bank with b of a and chase b or a is the worse i dislike their attitude apps excessive fees and service i guess that makes chase the best,1its great for chase members to have such easy and fast management of their money  i use it a lot for chase to chase when paying rent or if i lead to lend money to someone or viceversa  its also very helpful with the push notifications making monitoring direct deposit effortless  plus transferring from one account to another is right there at you fingertips,1honestly this is the best banking app ever i love that they have a feature that you dont even have to sign in to see your account balance all you have to do is swipe for a preview when youre on the go all the time like me this feature is the best im very meticulous about my money so its great that its so easy to check whats going on with my account highly recommend both the bank and the app,1very easy to use user friendly and can move quickly through pages glad to bank with chase always making life easier best part is being able to pay anyone anyplace even someone who doesnt bank with chase this is an app i use everyday love it,1best bankingcredit card app i have all the others pale in comparison the only suggestion i have is make the app able to do everything and i mean everything that the website is able to do you know that the whole world operates on their phone or tablet these days few people use a computer for anything thanks,1a little upset because i wrote a super long review and it dismissed everything i wrote once apple asked me to change my nicknameanyways i love banking with chasenot just because this app is fabulous in every aspect possible but for everything else chase has to offertheir service helpfulness and convenience they off to their customersalthough i know i have the convenience of snapping a picture of a check and depositing through the app i dont mind walking into the bank to deposit thingsthe airconditioning is always so great and it is always very clean almost scary clean jokesanyways this app never disappoints thank you chase  stars all around,1this app does everything i need from a banking app it is easy to use and i especially like the feature where i can swipe to see my balances without logging in  it may not satisfy the super tech but in my case it operates great and the only function that may be missing is the ability of sending money to an outside bank however that is not super high on my list of services,1the latest version of chase is really nice  since i began using it i only deposit checks from my phone no more bank visits or atm stops i have never had any issues with it also i travel a lot for business and being able to access all my chase accounts and activity in one location is incredibly convenient,1itd be great if the app actually let me in when i needed to use it if im not on my home wifi chances are it will say mobile app temporarily unavailable this is very frustrating for a large bank youd think they could hire a decent it department to make a quality online banking app dont get me wrong im glad they arent opening accounts on customers without their knowledge but id really love to be able to login to my account when needed,1this is by far my favorite app i use it weekly amp sometimes multiple times daily to keep an accurate record amp to maintain my budget the best feature within the app to me is the instant transfer tab without it i may have oopsied on a couple of things in the past i also love chases customer service which is bar none brilliant ,1i love this app it gives me easy access to my account while still having security features  it allows me to send and receive money requests and have it delivered to my bank almost instantaneous  i sometimes dont even need a password to login touch id allows me to sign on to my account however it sometimes wont ask me,1i have been using this for four years and i love it ive never had any problems or issues with it  i love the text that i receive letting me know when money has been taken out of my account  i didnt have any problems with the new app it took me a couple of tries but i got the hang of it i can always get into my account,1my only complaint is not the app but online banking itself they often change the format requiring some time to find your way around not all changes are for the better i do wish i could use touch id since i do not store my user name and password in my phone  all in all this app is a great convenience,1this app is always improving and never letting me down i love all the features that it has even when you login it knows what time of the day it is where i live and changes the picture its amazing so convenient and userfriendly the original bank who came up with the convenient and brilliant ideas in this one app,1i use this app for my liquid account i like it cause its real time none of that hey when did this charge come up as long as you keep your notifications on you get instant updates from deposits to withdrawals to whatever you spend that very second i gave it four stars cause i cant really utilize the app the way i want cause i have a liquid account other than that its handyin my life ,1i have nothing good to say about how customer service is when it comes to meet your needs but the design of the app is definitely user friendly and easy to navigate and their push alerts added with apple push alerts keep you up to date with due dates and deals that may interest you,1app is great very user friendly can easily check account balance and activity and make wireless deposits and i dont use it for much else chase is not what i would call a customer or employee centered business however their app almost makes it seem like they care  stars because i only use it for the things mentioned above and cant vouch for anything else,1this app is amazing its super user friendly and allows me to take care of my banking needs on the go the only thing i wish it could do is be able to set up repeating transfers too i never log onto a computer so i have to remember to set up a transfer to my kids savings account and that doesnt happen as often as id like other than that its a great app,1love this ap because its very convenient and easy to use ones you are logged in the only negative is that i have to put in my password every time i have to log in other apps like this one has simplified it with use of fingerprint to do the same pls consider it during you next update thanks,1ive been using this app for years it is one that is simple and easy to use i pay all of my bills  transfer money between accounts and love the quick pay  it allows me to send money to my kids and others as needed in about  seconds  talking about convenience the best banking app period ,1this is a fabulous app now ive been using it since chase came out with it and it has dramatically improved over the years i love being able to deposit my checks using the camera i live about  miles from the nearest chase branch and its saved me a lot of trouble by being able to do that keep up the great work chase,1it does most of what i can do from the banks website it will even let me deposit checks by taking pictures of them it now allows me to make transfers from external banks as i can from the website it allows me to see checks written or deposited it allows me to use my thumbprint to see my account activity some of my earlier criticisms have been corrected including verification of transactions by thumbprint i would still like to see the following improvementswhen i have a new alert available on only one account display the alerts from that account rather than the first account listed in alphabetical order let the badge show the total number of unread messages not just ,1mobile check deposit and quick pay are great features that save time visiting an atm or bank maybe the most underrated feature is being able to set up custom alerts to lee you know when withdrawals of a certain size happen this really can help stop fraud immediately,1thumb sign in works all the time easy to navigate the app to all my accounts they recently upped my deposit limit from  to  when getting paid every other week my checks are bigger and i always had to go in the bank to make deposits so working off the app makes my time worth while to do other things thanks chase,1and i see someone else agrees we cant make mobile deposits if the account it even slightly or will be overdrawn by pending charges as the other person says it seems like punishment  except for that i like this app and use it all the time truly never have to go in the bank and can easily transfer  between accounts and check activity,1my issue is that once i put my password in then ive got to put my password in again to look at my statement seems a little redundant if someone has penetrated the access its just another additional time they put the password in that theyve compromised seems a little redundant if it was a different type of access password that would be one thing but it just asked for the same password,0this app is really lacking any thought about how to make a credit card holders life easier it isnt apparent when a billing cycle ends when you need to pay your bill or how much is owed you cant set up your bank account on mobile and you cant see any of your benefits or points its almost as if you accidentally downloaded the banking app and it shows that you also have a credit card take a page out of the book of the amex mobile app,1i gave this app a  star rating when i first downloaded it but theyve improved the app drastically since and its now a clear  star this polished app makes online banking so easy i use it to pay my credit card bills send money via chase quickpay and monitor my account balances its one of the best apps on my phone,1i use this every day and really only have a few suggestions a why is my daughters high school account show up as the go to account for everything i do in this app makes things difficult when in a hurry b why do you continuously ask me to review the app even after i have said no i dont want to review it pretty basic run of the mill banking app i can see my funds and transactions i can transfer funds and do other things,0this app was much more convenient to use before the credits and debits are not totaled anymore on the credit card and now they got away from even showing all purchases from the previous month you have to look at your statement to see them very inconvenient this makes it more difficult to watch my balances for my credit cards i wish it could use more of the old set up of the accounts the app gets worse every time they update it making it less convent to me,0i dont know why this is so hard please fix the login every week after changing my password the system tells me that you have entered the incorrect password and finally says youve attempted too many times your account is locked and must be reset although you know you have entered the correct password as large of a company that you guys are im pretty sure you have someone who can finally fix this issue youve got one job now do it a decent app when you can get into it fix that and go from a  to a ,1i love the mobile app we have a credit card through chase and the app is easy to use easy to navigate and everything is laid out to where i can quickly get to it and check my balance the statements show up fast when i use the card so i dont have to keep track of receipts to know how much i have spent on it,1if you need to deposit checks check balances get notifications or make transfers then this app will let you do it  does it have the most elegant interface no  its a little confusing to use takes a few too many taps to do simple things and looks like a boring banking app does any of that matter not really overall  good job chase,1the chase app allows the user to do several things including secure messages to and from chase which is a great feature  my only complaint comes from inability to do certain things such as request a credit card line increase and on the business side add a business credit card to your business account  other than that i wouldnt change much,1ive been with chase for over  years ive never had an issue from customer support to tellers and now to this great app its easy to use simple and the notifications help you stay on top of everything going on with your account best service there is when it comes to banks hands down ,0use to love this app but more recently the transactions posted disappear after a certain amount of time really dislike this feature i use to check my accounts daily and it gets extremely hard to do so when the transactions you want to see have to be opened separately in the statement pdf instead of scrolling or when they are gone and you cant see any transactions for this month anymore and the statement for this month is not available,0i hate using my chase app i have both boa and chase and i avoid banking with chase whenever possible if can because their app is not user friendly they dont have finger print identification and the transactions dont give enough detail on boa if you want more information about the transaction you simply click on it and all the details open up including the picture of the check on chase the description gets cut off and im left wondering where money went to or came from,1theres very little consumer banking needs that this site doesnt meet in efficiency and intuitive ui has not failed to be available  one improvement in the billpay to a chase cc one option to pay should be the statement balance the only choices are the minimum payment and the outstanding cumulative balance please address,1i used it to check balances pay my credit cards send money receive money deposit checks basically everything i used to have to go to the bank for i can do on the app except get cash i just go to the atm for that i cant remember the last time i went into an actual chase bank,1i absolutely love how convenient this app is ive  used this now for  years and it is always improving it keeps me up to date on both my personal and business accounts my clients also use it to pay me for their appointments instead of their cards this is app is the main reason why i continue to bank with chase,1this app is great to be able to quickly see any activity on your account i also really like the alerts these notify me of any transaction that exceed my set parameters works great for me my new credit card account appeard soon after i first used it now both cards right there for my perusal  i still feel the same this is one awesome app,1fast and easy they make it convenient for me to look at my account in a snap i only have problems when my service is down and have no internet connection other than that i primarily use the card for last minute payments and get plenty of time to pay back the card debt,0the app itself is nice easy to use and love the clean interface but the downside is that once i log into my account using the app or laptop a few times  it will lock my account even though i use the correct pw each time this has happened to me every week for over  months its annoying to unlockreset my password on a weekly basis its annoying enough that im considering closing my account dont know what the issue is but wish chase could fix,1this app meets my present needs for the most part  it is easy to manage my accounts within minutes and any occasional  limitations i am able to log into the web versionthe area that needs work is the text alerts  there is a delay informing me of low balances so that i may transfer funds  not sure if this is intentional but i feel that it should be more immediate to avoid fees,1this is a great app it updates immediately works well and has plenty of features for all your needs the layout of the app is very professional looking and is easy to navigate i personally have had no problems with this app and have been a user for just over three years now,1not a great app ui is dated i imagine this is to their advantage but seeing a total of your charges since your last statement would be helpful also needs push notifications for charges citi and amex are great examples for this some people like to see how their cards are usedanother helpful addition overall is to separate transaction by users gives some autonomy to card holders while giving access to the primary card holder if desired,1this is an app that does everything that it needs to do intuitive interface simple screen layouts and effortless touch id login make it a breeze to use definitely recommend and after several months of use i can confirm that this app is stable even with the few improvements that they have made to it good job chase,1i find the app very convenient especially being able to deposit checks without going into the bank i also enjoy the touch feature i have been a chase customer for over  years and they have come a long way in technology always convenient and reliable,1the best thing about chase is that they show you your credit card balance within minutes of making a charge really helps when youre tracking expenditures otherwise its a solid app easy to access and lots of info in a convenient format,1have been using this app for over a year and love the easy access to current balance and charges as well as looking at statements from  months or years ago all you have to do is type in the dates you want to see statements from no need in looking through a whole bunch of paperwork like we used to,1used to love this app and chase but now every time i login it tells me i and use touch id because i have to log in and allow it i never remember my password so ive had to change it five times in the last few months to log in then i turn on touch id then go to log in again and surprise no touch id activated i ended up starting a new account with a different bank because of the inconvenience and only keep this one to pay my credit card bill,1it does exactly what it is supposed to do and it does so cleanly and easily if you have any type of account with chase then you need this app i know this review is not all that detailed but there really is not that much to say beyond that it works is nice looking and you have your accounts in the palm of your hand oh and its free of course so do you use chase yes download this right now,0the idea of the remote check deposit is very cool  it saves me a trip to the bank  it reduces lines at the bank  it saves chase from accepting and storing the paper check  everyone wins rightno  you dont win  this is only useful if you want to never deposit more than  in a thirty day period not a month  a thrity day periodmoreover when you enter an amount over the limit the app wont tell you it wont accept the check until after you take a picture of your signature on the back  so now you have a signed check and it wont take ithow hard would it have been to make the app alert you that the amount you entered is more than allowed  or heck show you the amount you can deposit insteadlame and suspicious  either they have an ulterior hideen motive for the limit or their just that dumb  but you can bet your tax dollars paid a bonus to the executiev who got the credit,1fast in updating live transactions i love the fact that seconds after i deposited in the atm it posted as pending when i checked the mobile app the closest chase bank to me is over  min away and to make check deposits via mobile phone is amazing now only if it were possible to do the same thing with cash lol i love my bank,1i downloaded this app brcause i just received my first check from my job and i didnt want to go to the bank to deposit it so i downloaded this app to do a direct deposit from my ipod touch and it worked really well i now have to wait for the money to clear so i can use it i would say this app is a go you will not be disappointed ,1its as simple as this if you love to manage your finances electronically you should get a chase account and this app i seriously believe that if i didnt have a chase banking account id open one just to have this app the functionality and ease is beyond anything else out there ive been banking with chase for  years and this app puts the icing on the cake very well done,1i find this app useful and have had no stability issues it allows me to see my many chase accounts balances and activity in one place i also like the many useful customizable alerts i would rate this higher but find a limitation in account transfersi cannot transfer money into my chase accounts from outside accounts even though the outside account is setup online please add this functionality,1overall  firstly ive been using this app for about  years now and i have almost no complaints anymore most flaws have been dealt with so im happy the ui is very simplistic i bank with bank of america as well and the way they have their application set up is amazing i would recommend chase to do so as well functionality id give like a  it does everything you need it to do but no wow factor theres nothing that sets it apart to make people say your app can tell time well my chase app can do that and teach me how to tie a tie i know how to im just out of it and cant think straight suggestioni think it would be awesome to incorporate touchid with the application like if im using my finger it looks into my account but if my wife were to use hers itll log into hers,1i never had an issue depositing a check with this app until this last month  i dont know if there was a recent update or something my apps update automatically but seriouslydo i need a tripod to use the camera on this app to deposit a check  it is nearly impossible   i just spent  min trying to hold still enough for the picture to takeand i had to just give up  i could have driven to the bank and deposited it manually by now,1i live the new update to the app but somewhat disappointed being that i received an email last week that this update was coming from the email i just knew they were going to incorporate touch id for logging in hopefully apple will allow this in the future other than that slight let down im thoroughly impressed thanks again,1i personally love the app i dont have any complains about the font size or the new layout it sometimes time a while to load but no biggie if you have a problem with people looking at your screen maybe you shouldnt look at your bank account around others simple as that i love it  i recently switched from boa to chase the app is waaaay better than boa,1i love the new interface it feels welcoming this app is very convenient and very well thought through i think chase has done an exceptional job at the thoroughness and mindfulness in putting together this app for our convenience i use it often to check the balance or deposit a check or to transfer money,1i like everything about mobile banking except finding out i cannot make a mobile deposit because the check i intend to deposit totals about  more than the mobile deposit limit if the mobile deposit process generates digital images  front and back  of the check why impose an arbitrary limit on the amount of the check deposited via mobile banking,1as banking apps go this is about the best out there  i would like to see  upgrades  the ability to see a cashed check without having to go to my computer and  it would be very convenient to be able to transfer money between different financial institutions that being said i still give the app a star rating,1cant tell you how much i love this app its been so unbelievably helpful on the go my only qualm is that not all features on the internet browser are included on this app however its a great little app for when i want to check my account or make a quick transfer i highly recommend it,1very functional and convenient my young adults have their high school bank accounts with chase this app makes it very convenient to transfer money and keep tabs on my money as well as my childrens money i have never had any issues using this app and i am not good with technology stuff highly recommend,1chase has great online banking service but i loved the old version of the app betterafter the update everything is so too much bright and colorful it distracts me in finding the information im looking for also the font used is too big i normally open the app when im away from home work by the street and i feel that i have less privacy since the font are so big other people can easily read from distance,1i use this app daily to track my account ive customized my alerts and they are a great addition for me to stay aware of my acct usagemy one complaint is that i have to take what i feel are too many unnecessary steps to view the actual alert messages a simple tweak to display the alert message after login would be appreciated and would add to the already userfriendly aspect,1chasess iphone app has become my daily right hand man for my business and im glad they improved the apps performance when depositing checks previously it used to take a few attempts when taking pics of a check before it would finally register and deposit but now  its accepts them on the first shot very convenient,1i am able to do my main daily functions on the app without any issues however it is annoying that the notification bubble never goes away the number just keeps ascending as more notifications come in also why doesnt it take you straight to the alert after you select it from the drop down screen lastly we should be able to delete alerts from inside the app,1i wish i could login to my account with touch id as i have an iphone  this would be a lot faster instead of typing letter by letter my password and i dont really get the swipeto see my account feature because if i ever lose this phone my info would be all out there for some one to swipe to the right and see not feeling that touch id is a must,1i never thought i needed this app until it saved me numerous times with alerts and how easy it is to access my account it helps me keep track of my spending and its great to know you can go back in your account history and see how you spent your money salute to my banker for strongly suggesting i download the app immediately thanks for the heads up,1best features for a banking app  check deposit feature works very well and seeing balance at a glance without logging in is worth its weight in gold the new touch id just adds to the abilities of this app  love how my bank stays current with the technology  all banks that dont embrace will perish  thank you for a great working and functional app,1greatbeen using this app for approximately three years the app was wonderful when i first installed it it has saved me many hours of time in the last few years i would recommend it to anyone and everyone i know  the improvements over the years have only made it better i would actually recommend chase bank to everyone,1love this banking app i never log onto the website any more as this app does everything i want quickly and easily and now it includes touch id logon which is even better never had an issue with any of the functionality and i appreciate that the chase team is constantly releasing updates to make it even better,1chase is always making great improvements like the accounts preview or the fingerprint password anything quick and easy is what i love and chase surely takes that to the next level with features mentioned above and the push notifications and quickpay options overall this is my favorite banking app,1this app is so convenient everything is easy to find and very user friendly you are able to check statements quick pay pay bills etc they give you alerts of any maintenance or updates ahead of time i use the app more than the bank and website thats how easy and simple it is,1this app is pretty much everything you really need from a personal banking app real time account balance for debit card and credit card help finding atms transferring money and all of the other random stuff that i never use its nothing fancy it just works this is why i gave it  stars it delivers exactly what it is supposed to,1if you happen to bank with chase i dont see why you wouldnt have the app  its added convenience and ive been seeing improvements to something that was already pretty helpful to begin with  the amount of things that i can do from my cell phone with this app is crazy and more importantly appreciated,1id give it  stars if i could i use it all over the world to access my bank accounts credit cards and other bills and i pay them all remotely wherever i am no hassles you can set payment dates in the future if you know you might be away from internet for a while life saver these past  years of travelling,0i cant give enough info to actually state if i like this company but i am closing my account because chase made it difficult for me to use me own card for the first day i called the  number because i was declined they forward me to a fraudulent department and they could not verify me i have several accounts and this is the only company that cannot verify me if i were to have another alert in the future going through this hassle is not what i want to go through at all yes i am ok with having fraudulent alerts but if i am the account holder and i cant get helps why stay,1i love this app and the fact that you added the fingerprint sign in  is awesome the only thing that i dont like is i couldnt access my secure messages unless i put my password in what other more secure way is there to access your account than your own finger print i think you should have full access when using the finger print login but other than that its a fantastic app,1i love how i am able to keep track of my account on my phone in real time the only problem i have with this app is that with this new update i am having to constantly verify my devise because it stops recognizing my phone i have had my phone for a year and i have had this app even on my last phone i have to verify every  logins or if i havent logged in in a few days it is becoming a hassle to have to keep doing this,0im a busy mom who works then is running around with kids i dont have a desktop hooked up right now just moved amp dont have time to stop at a branch with my overly active yr old to update my addressorder checks your app doesnt have a desktop version nor gives you the ability to do either of the things i need to do you can not take care of all your banking needs with this app ive tried going thru safarigoogle but get redirected to the mobile version so frustrating fix it please,1the app lets you see your account balance and lets you quick pay its also cool that the background of the app changes to the time and your location youre in sf itll be bay area themed in new york itll be big apple themed etci dont know why other people expect more from this app trust me its a must have for chase bankers,1i can honestly say that i havent had any issues with the chase app in all the years ive had it i use it everyday and its been a huge convenience whether its depositing checks with the photo feature or checking my checking savings and credit card balances it even searching for branches and atms this app is wonderful,0update still a good app but too long without a widget that can display account balance decent app for most features cant complain but the app needs significant improvement on push notifications rather than a range there should be an option to be notified of any and all transactions instead of a lengthy message notifying a transaction above your alert additionally there should be push notifications available for chase quickpaythe app should be made more simplesque in reference to the bank,1while im happy chase finally decided to support touch id they still require you to enter your password password is required for actions such as depositing checks viewing statements and probably more i can understand if it was for sending money out but this is not about security and its hurting my workflow if the user authenticated once why would you ask for a password again and again for each action,1can do everything that the website is able to  plus the check deposit function is top  i appreciate if i get sidetracked and forget to log out the app does it for me easy to use each function thanks to chase for really working with customers to create the most user friendly and easy to use app,1this app is so helpful and works consistently well i have occasionally had an issue with being able to log in as in the boxes to enter text would disappear sometimes but there are no problems now it has many features offered on the online version so its great for onthego banking,1my wife and i have use this app for years the ability to deposit checks from anywhere is very liberating i also love that i can pay my bills without additional fees from anywhere the app is welldesigned and never crashes  i only wish that they would add a feature to support the fingerprint login,1love the one touch login the edeposits and the easy intuitive menus i use the app all the time on my phone chase seems ahead of its competitors keeping this app useful and easy to use i cant wait until i can one day pay for everything directly from my phone and i wont have to carry credit cards or cash around anymore,1this is my favorite banking app by far i can easily do everything i need to right from my phone one thing that could be improved dont require me to enter my password to view check images when ive already used my fingerprint to log into the app its an added step that is a waste of time please fix this,1ive been using the chase app for a long time and have no complaints  i find everything very easy to use  i use it most for deposits quick pay checking transactions and paying bills  i think chase has been a banking leader in mobile technology for years  very happy with chase overall,0at one time you could make a purchase with your credit card and with in minutes your phone would tell you that you theres a charge on your credit card i guess they stopped that  i could log into my account and see what money i owed and i could pay on that account now i can only pay on the account i cant see what im paying for now i have to login with the name password and fingerprint id and it should only be with fingerprint id nobody can copy that so why am i using the mobile app,1i have been using this app since it became available to deposit checks and have never had an issue recently i started using the chase quickpay and enjoy the option of paying my bills on it especially if i am traveling and forget to do it at home i absolutely love the convenience it provides,1this is a good app however there should be the ability to peek at current balance payment due date and amount and available credit from both the notification area and when the app is open but before logging in this feature is available on my barclaycard app and is excellent,1i really like it it makes it easier for me to check my balance when i need to know if i can use my debit card and i like being able to take a picture of my check to get it in my account i also love being able to get money transferred over if i need it for an emergency or if i need to pay someone back for paying for me,1this app kicks a except finding you have  alerts buried away somewhere in the app easy to use simple and truly enjoy receiving the alerts on me phone chase is killing it with this app just a little fine tuning and chase is   long time downey saving customer gives it  two thumbs up btw us bank charges  to deposit checks by phone forget the measly price its the principal,1easy to use reliable does everything i need it to doonly one criticism sometimes the check images are not clear enough even they obviously are and the check cannot be deposited this is most likely a backend problem but i wish theyd fix itother than that im satisfied,1my husband and i are truck drivers and are never home through the week we do all our banking from our phones we each have our own account but our accounts are linked so we can easily transfer money from one account to the other i really dont know what we ever did without this service,1i could not be happier with chase or their app it is the most oft used manner in which i bank and pay my bills i love the efficiency and fact that i do not have to open my laptop to get things done they have made it so much easier to not just check my balances but pay my bills and transfer money when i get in a bind thank you chase,1so ive had this app for about a year now super convenient and easy to use im two states away from home and whenever my parents need to send me money we use quick pay and works every time and the best part is you can use that recently transferred money on the spot i totally recommend this app for people who dont have it,1i really do love this app it makes my life so much easier monitoring the various accounts my family has my mom tends to be overdrawn and being able to transfer money to her account immediately from the app is such a huge help i love being able to deposit checks on the fly without having to go to the bank,1has the bank information and functions i need and does them well pretty solid and stable platform  only a few glitches to report the finger print window sometimes fails to load a quick pay submittal cancelled for no apparent reason had to do it again and when i double click to close the app it frequently goes to my debit card remote paying mode,1this app is pretty perfect lightning fast always up to date and never down or out of service lots of thoughtful ways to speed up getting you to the info you want the snapshot and fingerprint reader are cool ways to get in quick i love being able to view statements without being sent to a website like almost all other banks i have,1works very well for basic account maintenance ie checking transactionsbalance making payments etc  it can be annoying to have to go to the full site for more involved actions such as contact info update etc but for daytoday business this app works very well for what it does and has a pleasing interface,0mobile deposit max is  only my husband and i share the exact same accounts and he has a  limit so he often has to deposit my checks for me annoying i called chase and they said k is the max when i told them impossible because my husband has k and deposits my checks for me it goes through they said no cant be and they wouldnt extend my limit they were completely useless i have been with chase for more than yrs without any problems except this,1the chase app has all the basics and a bit more the login is easy and all my accounts are listed on the first screen even my credit card i can access quickpay with one swipe the layout is intuitive and you can get more detailed account information with one click im quite pleased with this app,1the app has an easy to use interface with all the functionalities i need to pay off credit cards transfer money to and from savings and keep a record of my spending its great to be able to check my account whenever i want wherever i want and helps me feel like i can make more financially responsible decisions,1super helpful i love this app at any time i can just open the app to check my last transactions statements current balance everything is there for our convenience also it has the option to use touch id for security pretty awesome app id give it  stars if i could but  will do for now,1i hate having to go to the bank for deposits this app makes it very easy for me to get my money amp i love it transferring money on here is also a plus only thing i wish they would work on would be the statements page i wish i could click on a transaction so it can tell me exactly where i made a purchase other than that cool app,1i love that all my banking is accessible in one place its really easy to transfer money make payments and deposit checks my chase credit cards are automatically linked to the app which makes it easy when it comes to making payments probably not the most convenient if you use multiple banks,1its a great app for my personal and business accounts i love the mobile check depositing they finally increased their limits on mobile check deposits which makes it even more convenient nowi like the swipe to quickly preview account balances as well as chase quickpay and easy bill pay,1ive used a couple different banking apps and this is by far the best one i have checking and savings accounts investments and a credit card with chase and i can manage everything in one place this makes my life much easier and i love that i can get a feel for my financial situation with just one glance at this app great job chase,0hate hate hate having to enter my password for every single transaction i do what is the point of the fingerprint just to view accounts apparently but yo can do that on the account preview without a sign on or fingerprint its not like entering a  digit pin for every transaction at the arm this is absolutely ridiculous and needs to change if my fingerprint can open the app then it has to be me so i should be able to don anything once in the app like every other app out there that uses fingerprint the whole point is to avoid entering a password,1user friendly simple to use and great for making credit card payments easier to make happen i love quickpay check depositing and the apple touch fingerprint login option ive used chase all my life and i will continue to do so since theyve made banking easier for me while on the go,1the touch id option on this app makes it super fast and super easy to just get a glimpse of your current balance right before you make a purchase which i love im able to do just about everything through this app that i would normally be able to do on my computer its really convenient,1this is my go to app for almost everything i do with chase the only thing really missing from a five star review is the fact that finding a location or an atm is very useless vague street addresses when i am out of town dont help having to leave the app to see a map location in comparison to where i am is dumbif you could imbed a pinpoint map i would give you five stars,1as a technical person i can definitely say that chase mobile is very robust application the user interface is intuitive and easy to navigate its the ease of use that got me the best feature for me and my friends is quick pay the bestif you need a spokesperson for chase i should be your st and only candidate im passionate about what i like,1i cant find much wrong with this app  all the functionality built into a intuitive interfacereminds me of apple productssoftware which are the best in the industry at this  hopefully they dont mess with a good thing in future updatesonly thing i would add is an easy way to access rewards unless it is there and i am missing it,1its a snap to manage all of our accounts  including our kids  with this terrific app  the only complaint i have is that my hubby can see two of the three kids accounts but i can see the third and ha cant see her so it makes sending money to their accounts more complicated than it should be,1so easy to use i can control my money from anywhere ive had this app for awhile now and ive never had any problems with it i have the settings turned on to notify me if my balance gets low and with the click of a couple buttons i transfer from one account to another and dont get charged any fees,1i appreciate the one view of all my accounts and the ability to quickly see detailsi can manage payments on short notice plus the added benefit of making a deposit without having to go to the bank is wonderful updates seem to work without issue,1i do not live close to a chase so this app has to work when i need it i use it daily to oversee my account and do transfers and make deposits the deposit application could use some work but overall it does exactly what i need it to do the customer service you get when you have to call in that could use some work,1does what it should  access account info deposits pay bills chase pay straight forward interface still needs work on the alerts when you get to alert screen it would be better of you could see you most recent alert across all accounts right now you have to browse through each account to hunt for the alert,1i love the convenience of using this app especially to check my balance when things get a bit tight that said my local branch is staffed by the most helpful and friendly people so i do like to visit in person from time to time chases combination of online convenience and personal attention is impeccable,1i like that i can pay bills and deposit checks with no issues it would be nice to just get an alert once until i change something not every single day like balance alerts i know its below after the first alert obviously its not going back up or down until i deposit money or pay my credit card alert me the first time and then stop,1this is a good and convenient app only thing id like to see in a future update for ios is having a thumb scanner option in lieu of entering your password bank of america has this feature and it makes accessing your account much easier its an optional feature for their app for those who dont trust the scanner security would be a five star rating if they had that feature,1i love this banking app easy to use always reliable and you can basically do anything you need to including check deposits transfers check balances and recent transactions view your online statements and even wires its amazing i would bank with chase just because of this app so much better than my other banks app,1because of this app i almost never go to the bank or atm for anything other than depositing or getting cash i love that it automatically integrated my chase southwest credit card when i signed up for it making paying my bill a breeze i love the flexibility and comprehensiveness of the alerts that can be set up,1i really like how easy to navigate and smooth this app runs i rarely have to go to the chase site for anything because all i could need is located right in the appi do wish the secure message center worked better though i usually cant get it to load i also wish there were customer support links somewhere in the appoverall though i really love it,0i open the app with touch id but i still need to enter my  character alphanumeric pass word to pay bills i have an ipad pro and an ipad air that i use interchangeably each time i switch from one to the other i get the message that i am using a device never used and have to go through the identification process all over again i was told by customer service that it was a problem with ipads that they were working on its been about  months now maybe i miss understood and she said they were sleeping on it and not working on it,1i only use this app to pay my loans i dont like that it doesnt show the original loan dates or things like amortization to check extra payments etc  i cannot use the desktop version on my phone because apparently chase made it so that it takes you directly to the mobile version if you tryat least on my end so now i cannot check any of these things at all now  for paying bills its fine though,1no other banking app works as well as chase i never have to log onto the main site because i    can access and navigate all of my accounts and make transfers and utilize quickpay appreciate the updates and that they dont hinder my usage because they are never done during business hours great app if youre a chase customer,1easy to access simple to use my only suggestions add a search function to compare like transitions  ie to quickly calculate how much you spent on groceries in a set time also an inapp calculator would be neat the functions is does include are fabulous easy to check balance transfer money to one of your accounts or someone elses and set alerts,1this app has rejected every check i have tried to deposit and it tries to blame my pictures for not being clear enough  well if a large legible infocus and perfectlyaligned photo taken by an iphone  camera isnt clear enough the fault sure isnt minei previously used bofa where you could take pictures of checks extremely quickly it seemed to autoalign and they were always accepted,1the most user friendly of the apps i use the information refreshes in live time i recall going to a nail salon and not knowing they charge a fee to use cards because i use this app an alert appeared on my phone including the fee at which point i brought it to the shop owner that this fee isnt posted anywhere to notify their card carrying clients love this app,1ill start with the one frustration  its too often down or unavailable aside from that when it is functioning fully i love the ease of control and access i get with this app depositing checks with my phone makes things easier on me which is always a plus the redesigned app looks much nicer and works better than before and i appreciate the attention to detail,1i love this app because of the convenience it offers its literally banking at my finger tip the only thing i cannot do is handle physical cash love that i can deposit checks from my phone find bank locations also the swipe for balance feature is very helpful this app allows me to do everything i need to do on the go when i may not have time to sit in front of a computer,1i love this app and the convenience of being able to see all my account information with just the touch of a button this app would be five stars if the check deposit would read the check properly and fail to accept the photo i tried multiple times to try to get the check deposited and it failed every time other bank apps like usaa their deposit mobile works great please upgrade,1i can deposit checks easily transfer money between accounts and pay off my chase credit card without leaving my house or even having to log in to a computer the user interface is also really easy to navigate i love this app and i use it all the time,1chase mobile app provides all the convenience of banking love the direct deposit of my paychecks and option of depositing checks without having to go to a local branch i dont drive and the nearest location to me is  bus rides away i work from home so not having to travel to the bank to make a deposit is priceless,1overall its a good app it provides pretty much all the information you can get from the desktop website i am giving it  out of  for one reason it could use the fingerprint authentication to login instead of using a password unfortunately this is one app that doesnt enable this particular feature otherwise i would give it  stars,1chases mobile app is by far the easiest banking app ever  not only can you see your balances but you can also transfer make payments and make deposits all from your mobile device the neatest feature is the ability to see your balances without having to log in its such a time saver,1this is now a very polished easy to use app its what a banking app should be still i wish theyd let me pay all my bills in a list the way i can online rather than just one at a time just add a see all option on the payment screen if you think itd be too busy or let me select all i want from the select screen,1i have been using this app since the beginning of time or since it went live and i have to say its a really great app its reliable and dependable it meets all your needs at the palm of your handor the whole hand depending on the phone you have the only thing you cant do is spend your points if you have any,1this app is very clean with its layout and very simple to use much better than other credit apps i have used my one complaint would be an easier login no matter how many times i ask for the app to remember my credentials it doesnt then using the token is just extra work when i still need to type in my password i hope that this app inherits touch id login soon,1best app ever so easy to use i have everything i need right at the palm of my hand deposit checks send money receive money etc i just wish they would be a little faster on preapproved transactions my car insurance has an autopay their app shows its payed but it wont show up on my chase app until  days later,1the app does just about everything id expectlike a bank app to do the only thing id add is touch for password my password keeps getting invalidated because of too many attempts to break in so i have to keep changing it it would be nice to be able to get in without having to go through the new password activation when im away from home and need access quickly,1this app is a joy to use the best feature  depositing a check by simply taking a picture of the front and back my account information is always at my fingertips the interface is well designed intuitive and responsive i cannot think of a single issue well done,1its great and convenient i use it to make sure recent credit card transactions are recorded correctly the only thing id improve is the signin process yes i understand it needs to be password protected but now that my iphone has a fingerprint scanner maybe the chase app should have one too makes it easier to log in while still being secure,1there does seem to be a little bit of a problem with the check deposit as of late i have not had a problem but i did two months ago  you have to be careful about the angle and shadowing of the image when you were taking the picture im not impressed with the hunt and peck in the alerts for each account but that could be a quick fix,1it needs improvement on updating balance and pending amounts its sometimes not updated accurately which makes you think you either have funds or no funds which can be problematic for account owner four star for the the app easy to navigate and fast i like the layouts as well and the greeting just the efficiency of the funds available and accuracy needs work,1the application do the work as a charm on the basic transactions check balance on accounts transfer money in the spot quick send and received money from other chase accounts holders is in a second some people wants a super bank app please keep track of you own vacation groceries some place else by the way we dont use all that information at all for me does great,1banking on the go something i prefer when making transfers or seeing transactions i still rather bring my checks in the actual bank however im glad the app finally works for depositing checks without having to go to the bank it used to crash or not work at all for me,1everything it does it does well im unsure if this function exists but i cant seem to find it itd be nice to be able to filter and search transactions in my accounts for example in my checking account it would be nice to be able to filter a search to the following all transactions from  june   june between  something of that sort great app though,1i like the dependable banking approach right from my phone a couple things biggest thing to get fixed is the decimalwe are working with money it should be in place right away second i dont find this new online setup very user friendly it is harder to find unused hidden accounts and bring them back when needed for bill pay overall great online approach,1in general i find dealing with chase a very pleasant experience the people inside the bank are always very courteous and helpfulas a suggestion my discover card has the ability to lock my card i think every card should have this featureother than that im very happy with chase,1i use this everyday and it works great the complaint is that when it indicates a message or alert but you have to look through every account to figure which account has the alert i have  accounts and might see an alert badge but when i click into alerts on the menu there is no indication of which account so i have to look through every one until i can find the alert,1i dont know why this app has such low reviews ive been using it for years and love it for all my banking needs ive never had an issue and recommend it for all chase users and for those people that complain about it not being able to sync with apple watch thats not a legit reason to give it a  star rating,1without comparing this app to other banking apps i think its nice and a grand improvement over its previous versions there are improvements that can be made which i assume are in other posts one improvement i would like to mention is the ability to use my thumbprint sign on after switching from the preview and a more intuitive search while in my account detail,1i use this app almost daily and its fine for basics i can pay a bill but cant set up a recurring payment from app when there are alerts it defaults to the first listed account and i have to guess in which account there is an alert they fixed the issue with problem account numbers that you couldnt correct in the online deposit function so that works better other than that its a stable usable app,1great app i personally use this daily one minor complaint is that whenever they do system maintenance after completion the thumb print login is inoperative i have to log in then reinitialize this feature for it to be operational most likely this is by design but i always use the same registered device so it would seem that the system should operate the same after maintenance,1its an app for chase bank it works and is easy to use i have multiple accounts and travel frequently this app has made banking so much easier now that i dont have to go out of my way to find a chase bank in the area they are always improving the app which just makes it even better,1another bank i deal with allows logging in by drawing a design on a grid of dots its easy and fast i would like this app better if that were incorporated here too other than that i have no complaints  they allow fingerprint sign in now but it never asks for that i have to put in my password i have another app that keeps all my passwords when i get the pw for this app and return to it then it asks for the fingerprint its very annoying,1this app has really been a huge convenience since i travel constantly and have no time for making bank stops or searching for the next branch city to citycouldnt imagine ever going back to traditional banking only wish i could increase the limit for even more deposits without limitations perhaps somedaylove it either way,1i use this app for transferring money in and out of other accounts of mine and to check balances etc works great for me checks are so yesterday although i do write a check maybe once or twice a year havent deposited a check in years electronic payments and deposits work fine chase customer service is excellent thank you,1the app is great but i dont understand why it takes  days sometimes to post a purchase also the purchases never match the day i made them if i made a purchase sunday it says i did it tuesday like really the app sometimes takes forever to load but overall its a great app i can easily transfer money request and send money and thats really great thanks chase programmers,1this app really allows me the freedom and peace of mind to be on top of my finances in real time no ghost figures to worry about here folks and all while my sensitive account information is totally safe and secure mix that in with the level of service when you call in for help and you have your self a  star rating thanks the bautista family,1this app is very user friendly as i think about what id like it to do while exploring i find it can do exactly what id hope it could from offers to paying a bill to communicating my concerns im admittedly surprised that a bank as large as chase would have mastered customer service at this level well done chase very well done,1i love how convienient this app is i love just opening it and seeing my current bal the only thing i dont like is the new update for the account history for my credit card i used to be able to see my total history for my credit card and be able to see it more clearly but since the update its way more confusing to see what i actually owe or how much ive paid,1the developers deserve a great deal of credit for this app the screens are very deliberately designed and each screen is very clean it takes milliseconds to load and contains all of the features you would expect couple these things with the usual great customer service and ladies and gentlemen you have a winner nice job chase,0when i tried adding a new recipient using quickpay with zelle using this application i entered the name and the email address i did not enter the mobile number since it is optional then the app does not show me done or add recipient button or option i had to click the mobile number field to show the done button please fix as user would just cancel adding the recipient since they would think it is not allowing with only email mobile browser and desktop versions are working well,1its been ages i have logged in my account from desktops all my required and other kind of transactions are managed from here only one quick suggestion if feasible allow to view routing and account information as well as any online checks required to print out for submitting eft,1i am loving the updated version of the app before it was too difficult to look at transactions more than a month old and now theyve simplified the view i love how youve got all of your cards on the home screen easy to see all your info huge improvement,1thank you chase for using apples fingerprint id system love everything else about the app and find it makes managing my multiple accounts simple and quick for my most frequent account needs including funds transfer and balance check remote check deposit remains my favorite feature,1i have found this app easy to use i can use the app for bill pay chase quick pay and easy check deposits  it also links to customer service and tech support i can view all my chase accounts at once get and view my statements  great new update for iphone users is fingerprint unlock,1this app is very easy to look at and use  i find it very useful for keeping track of my accounts and moving money between accounts  depositing checks has always worked flawlessly for me and transferring money to others with quick pay is easy and seamless  no complaints  if they put an extra  in my account ill add the th star,1i have to take points off my rating because the finger print integration needs improvement    when i try to get a quick review of my account it is annoying when the fingerprint scanner doesnt work and i have to reopen the app to get it to workupdate the addition of the fingerprint button is useful  instead of having to restart the app i can press the button when the fingerprint scanner doesnt open the app,1ive used this app from the beginning and have never had any problems some of the negative reviews are not app related but the lack of understanding of how billing works i pay bills transfer money use the finger print option and track my spending no problems,1this makes my banking quick and easy i love that i can send and receive money to any other chase account holder of course checking my balance has been made simpler as well as depositing my checks has changed my schedule and made the quick trips to the bank no longer eating up my time this app is a time saver,1i love it and have as long as ive had an iphone  i look at it daily sometimes more a day  it helps me greatly  i also have a credit card and can move between accounts  it was easy to learn and use  i can deposit checks without going to the bank which is awesome  all in all the app makes my life easier,1this app is very easy to use very convenient you have access to your accounts and even credit cards with chase i would like them to add the option if you lose or misplace your card where you can lock it with the swipe of a button if possible that is all that is missing,1ok i can now pay my credit card  my card was taken over by chase and they didnt keep the payment info on file  i had to set up payment info from their regular website  after that everything is fine  so if you have problems with this app make sure you properly set up everything on their original websitegave  stars because to compansate for the single star i gave it on my previous rating it deserves  stars since i cant use my wamu checking and savings on this app they took it over so they should have included it by now   previous commenti can view account info i cant make a payment on my credit card,1the latest version of the chase app makes me happy to be a customer the ability ti deposit checks via the iphone is wonderful and i have deposited at least  checks via this method flawlessly  this is a tremendous time saver and supplements an already strong set of features which includes bill payment and transfers great job chase,1the new check deposit feature worked for mei made a check deposit to a premier checking account but it appeared that my free checking account would have been eligible for the service too if you try it and your account isnt eligible you might want to talk to a banking rep at your local branch to see why,0this app only provides an error message saying were temporarily unable to log into chase try again later  iphones later  calls to the tech dept   rude supervisors and  order tickets later  of which got lost and the other i was told that the tech people were in the back without a phone and refusing to work still no workable app no courtesy phone call nothing although im not surprised that the app doesnt work chase is clearly too busy improving their stellar customer service to bother with such things as troubleshooting,1i love the app only problem i ever had was that the badges would add up and could not clear them but in order to clear the alert badges when logged in to your account go to more on the bottom right then click alerts and then click alert history when u do this the app recognizes that you have seen the notification and clears the badge overall great app,0i opened a chase account just to use this app  the idea is totally cool timesaving  unfortunately no checks over  dollars can be deposited and no more than  per month in total  for a middle aged professional this is inadequate  i have not been able to use the app or my account  spoke to chase asking to raise the limit  they were helpful but ultimately unable to make any changes  dont know whether i will close the account or wait a year and see if the limits are raised  im pretty disappointed  really wanted to bank this way,1love being able to view my account with a push of a button love the direct deposit but really wish chase would raise the limit i can only do one check a month it saves so much time to just deposit your check from your phone please think about raising the limit to about two thousand,0when you log on to view an alert example  you have a deposit over x it doesnt take you to the alert  furthermore when you click the alerts tab it doesnt take you to the alert  you still need to click view alerts and then guess which of your accounts had the alert because upon clicking view alerts it tells you you have no new alertsmy suggestion would be to have the app automatically take you to the account with the new alert  also it should keep the red alert circle until you click it and also display the circle with the number of alerts on each accountthere should also be an option to saveremember password  i have a password on my phone it is annoying having to log in every single time for all these appsderek,1since am always on the go nd not really keeping track of my money i just simply login to check my amount  transfer money to another chase holder account in just second  helps me safe time nd gas that i could be waisting by going to a bank  i just simply do it off my mobile app nd taraa like magic the other person receives it in less then  mins,1ive been using the app for a year managing my accounts and two high school kids accounts  my biggest complaint is the alert system is cumbersome it is always hard to see which account i am being alerted about  often all accounts had only old alerts but i still had a warning number   ios seems to have wrecked it but i am reinstalling hope that fixes it,0i loved this app until it stopped working i cant log in or anything ive tried deleting the app and reinstalling ive rebooted and tried a couple of the codes that were sent it just times out or says it cant log me in and try later well its been over a week now and nothing for three days but the same issues i hope they get the problem is fixed oh yeah im pretty savvy on the mac and pc were temporarily unable to connnect to chase please try again later thanks for your patience im using an iphone but i understand the evo is also having trouble,1overall the chase app works well the one issue is that the developer seems to have over thought is seeing account balances at a glance upon login you have to select your particular account and go to the next screen before you can see your balances there is ample space on the first screen to display balances even if you had  or more accounts,0the only reason its at one is because i didnt have the option of  stars ever since the most recent update the app has been by far the worst mobile banking app ive ever had it literally has taken me up to  minutes to load after putting my password in for those that say it might be my wifi ive tried this in multiple locations and also tried my other mobile banking app for my separate account and had no issues this needs to be fixed i never had this issue before the forced update on july  please do something,0i dont like leaving bad reviews but delt it was necessary very disappointed there is basically no functionality of the app just the bare minimum whats unfortunate is that i tried to open the website in safari and it continues to take you to the mobile version which is of no use not even a full site link the app is okay if all you need to do is pay a bill couldnt even look at the messages in the app in which i was having a conversation with a customer service representative very basic app i hope they make changes and add functionality,0i went with chase from bank of america because the business checking was less and still offered mobile deposit it never works i do business on fridays and saturdays its always maintenance on weekends it takes  tries to get a photo to take just to say unable to process if i would have known this i would have went elsewhere boa mobile banking is perfect always worked always went through not chase might as well go with a local bank you have to go to a branch to deposit checks boo hiss i wish i wouldnt have switched ,1i have no problems with this application overall except one when your automatic system sends alerts it is sending them on all my devices  ipad iphone and ipod i wish that alert notifications disappeared if i reviewed them on one of my devices unfortunately i have to log in and review same alerts on every device and it is annoying,1the app is overall convenient quick amp my main source to check whats going on in my finances my only gripe is that the app crashes a lot when it comes time to deposit checksas i recall the older versions crashed less and the only thing wrong with the older version at the time is that it was slower great but fix the check deposit reliability please,1i love this app i never need to go to the bank because i can do everything i need from my phone the alerts are great and let me know anytime my balance is low or i have reached a limit i can pay bills while on the go and deposit checks right from home its easy to use and the interface is beautiful,1i love this app i have it since it began and each version adds or improves it i love the convenience of making transactions no matter where in the world i am i can pay bills check balance transfer funds but the best feature chase offers is the alerts it keeps me up to date on a daily basis and flags any out of the ordinary activity,1i actually like the new version of this app it still is a bit confusing when i get a notification and there is a badge on the app i try to read it by going under the notification center and it shows my account but i have three cards and i dont know how to find which card the message is coming from other than that the app is amazing i really love it,1sleek design easy to navigate best photo deposit feature other banking apps ive used are more cumbersome the quick pay alert feature is inconsistent which caused me to miss the deadline to except some payments the badge icon for the account alerts needs to go a level deeper so you dont have to look thru all accounts to see which one has the alert overall a great app,1this app is a must have if you have an account with chase bank i check it every other day to make sure my account is good the fact that you can open an app on your phone and see everything that is going in and out of your account makes my life so much easier i dont know what i would do with out this app,1this app is great i love being able to check on my balances and transfer money between accounts the only problem is that the check depositing part isnt working i take the picture of the check then try to hit the use button and nothing happens i never had a problem with it till the last update,0i dont have a chase bank account just a credit card i do a lot of banking on my phone so i downloaded the app to get my statements on the go however the amount of information this app provides is very limited you cant see statements at all the list of transactions isnt even separated by statement its just on one long list also this is a rewards card and i cant redeem my points through the app either whats the point i have to go to a computer to do everything please add more features for credit card users,1as an ios developer i found this app pretty amazing aligned with ios design simple fast and pretty animations here and there has added to the visual appealing of the app thumbs up to the development teamas a bank customer it satisfies all of my needs i do not have complicated usecases but comparing to the other bank applications i have used this one is the best keep up the good job,1i use it to keep track of my accounts my savings checkings and my chase credit card its fast and great when using the pay my bills feature or even when using your phone to deposit a check just have to take a picture of it i would definitely recommend it its a great bank,1the chase app is one of the best apps ive seen my only problem is that i cant deposit cash money into my iphone lol it allows me to deposit checks manage all my accounts and pay bills just recently i was able to add my thumbprint so i dont have to type my very long pass word in i love it its free and my advice to you if you thinking about using it do so,1its a great app for my onthego moments one thing thats a little irritating is that the transactions stay pending for a long time when i log in to see how much money i have and nothings updated for a while but its also like that when i log in on the computer so maybe they can do something to speed up the process of transactions being recorded other than that i love this app,1i have utilized this application for transferring money remote check deposits and other normal banking transactions ive yet to find a flaw or functionality missingthey just announced biometric authentication and im excited to put that functionality to the test im sure it will be as solid as everything elsehighly recommended,1this is an app that i have utilized everyday for almost a year now and i absolutely love it the convenience is amazing and much appreciated the ease and availability of this online banking including deposits shows that chase cares enough about their customers and our busy lives to customize this app to keep up with the changing times i love it,1this app has had a history of bugs that seem to have been fixed for the most part it was nice when they raise the limit for deposits has orientation problems on the ipad that get on my nerves especially when youre trying to scan a check to deposit but they probably listen to customer complaints and fix what they can on the whole its pretty good,1this is a awesome app people that critic this app about changing payments dates and other stuff is because they do not know how to use the app this app make my life easier you can see you balance make transfers payments even take a picture of your check and make the deposit find atm and branch locations and much more i recommend this app ,1ive been using the chase app for a few years now and probably use most of the functionality offered  i like it so much that when we recently moved to a state that has no chase branches we are still able to use chase as our primary bank deposits are easy checking balances a breeze thanks,1this app is so user friendly  i use it daily to handling my banking transactions  i bill pay between  bills on the app and they usually post next day   you can do quick deposits using your camera transfer fund request amp send money tofrom nonchase bankers and so much more  awesome app and highly recommended,1i love it it just gets better and better what next  my bank in lake station in and the portage in chase bank are wonderful i love online banking the only thing i would love to see is the pig bank where they round off what you pay and the money goes into the pig and it gets fatter and fatter until it blows up and says see you next time  i love chase,1compared to other bank apps chase is my favorite its really easy to navigate user friendly and bill pay option one of the friendliest one so far i love the reminders and can keep track of transactions since i get notifications if there is transaction that exceeds my set amount,1it does everything that i needs it to when you deposit or withdraw money it shows up instantly every time more money than your set limit is spent it gives notifications anytime your account reaches below your set limit for how much you should have it notifies you you can transfer money from the app great app in general,0out of all my apps for banking this has to be the worst it is simple in how it shows information but lacks ability to do anything worthwhile other than see your balance and pay bills all of my other cards give me the option to make changes to my account like you can on the website and this app is locked down as well as their noble site to only showing their customers a few things out of all the banks i use this has to be the worst app always has been too simple and continues to lack behind their competition,1this chase app has improved our managing of our finances so much better than the old paper method of the last century  thanks go to chase for their forward thinking  i now pay bills right from my iphone as well as transferring money between accounts at chase as well as external ones other than chase  reliable,1we are a family of  with  young adultsteens theres been so many times one needs cash here amp there or i needy hem to go to store for me with a few clicks on my phone transfers get taken care of quickly i love this app i even deposit my weekly pay checks without having to go to the bank or the drive thru get it,1chase always seems to be the leader in online bank services the only thing i can think of that would be a great improvement is granting the ability to the user to direct received quickpay funds to different linked accounts each transaction just like is currently available for sending funds,1of all the banking apps ive used since i started mobile banking some years back the chase app has been pioneering and innovative in features and functionality as well as it has maintained simplicity the only area in which theres been little change has been logon security except for touchidbiometric improvements within the last year overall not so bad,1the app is improving constantly the one thing i wish i could do is to be able while in the credit card area is to click on the purchase amount and get information about that company it would just make checking on things so much better also the same while in the payment area other than that the app works fantastic,1i love the app im taking off one star because i have multiple chase accounts so my business account and my personal account each have credit cards and whenever i make a payment i get the following email message sent to either of my email addressesyour notification settings were changed for your chase mobiler app for iphoner or ipod touchrdear chase customeranother customer used your iphone or ipod touch to turn on notifications for their account the app only sends notifications to one chase mobile user per device so youll need to reset your profile if you want to get notifications about your account on your iphone or ipod touch,1app is simple to use whether youre checking your balance edepositing a check or sending money via quickpay i dont have any issues or concerns with the alerts as some users have mentioned even though i too have a few chase accounts i highly recommend the app as well as banking with chase,1i have credit card with chase  so far its a good app fast and does all the major things you need with chase for credit card  i cant speak for other baking services  two things need to be updated  first and foremost is fine print scanner instead if typing pw everytime you login second and not as big of a deal is aspect ratio of app for ipad needs to be updated,0i have an iphone   i love my phone  i use chase apps on my phone for a long time and now with a new update on chase app required my phone to have an ios  or higher in order to be able to get into my online account is ridiculous so hat mean chase is supporting smart phones company to sell more new devices but getting rid of clients that dont have up to date devices amp ios  i hate it and i think chase doesnt want me as their customer anymore  i will look for other financial institution now  thank you  upset customer,1overall the chase app is remarkable it allows you to see deposited checks as images and even let you deposit smaller checks directly into your account using your camera the general functionality is great one irritating drawback it makes no sense to have the biometric fingerprint access if you still have to manually sign in with your password in order to do most basic tasks this is irritating,1i have been very satisfied with chase  they are friendly to speak with every time i call about any questions even when i have a user error  also they keep my money safe and the bank staff at the locations are always happy  the bank mobile app is very easy to use and secure  thank you for being a good bank,1i love that i can sign in using my apple id finger print the app is easy to use because all the men yes and fictions are conveniently accessible from the home screen i have been using the chase app for many years and they have always adapted to an ever changing world of technology by enhancing their app to meet the standards of a face paced and tech savvy customers like myself,1personally i use this app for the bulk of my banking transfers deposits bill payment schedules are all possible on here which i find easier to use than signing onto a website every timecompared to the other apps i have seen chase easily has the best customer experience i recommend it to everyone,1its a great banking app very easy to use always accurate and up to date i love when banks show the pending amounts and deduct them from the available amount it save a lot of confusion the check deposit feature works well ive never had a problem overall great app,1just like i briefly described in the title i only use chase banking app because it is the only banking app that i have that and because my bank is chase so theres that too but even though i dont have much perspective on any other banking app i still like using this app because the chasequickpay is a cool feature which i like,1i love using the app for on the go money management  i can check and pay off balances and its everything you need in a mobile app  one drawback if any  i can use touch or swipe technology on my other money management apps to log in  having to type in log in credentials feels a little outdated  if they improve this feature it would be my ideal app,1i love you chase always have thanks for making everything so convenient with your amazing online banking features you make my finance life less of a burden for me and make it easier to manage thanks for keeping things up to date with technology and yet still simple enough for me to use keep up the good work,1the app for the past few weeks has been unreliable only on the weekends does it seem to act up but its annoying when it happens i can usually tell when its going to act up because there is a delay in the prompt for logging in with my finger then when it does prompt it kicks me out of the app i can be in the app and log off and  seconds go back into it and it wont let me fix whatever you screwed up this is ridiculous,1i am delighted by the chase mobile apps for ios  i appreciate being able to easily check balances make transfers and pay bills i also like the alerts to notify me of changes the app is easy to use allowing me to more efficiently and effectively manage my accounts both business and personal,0this app has been great for years but at some point in the last couple months it has stopped working reliably i have fingerprint login setup but often times it wont come up when i open the app also more often than not when i try to log in with my password the app crashes i noticed this around the same time that they started putting a credit card ad on the login screen no idea if those two things are relatedim running  on an iphone ,1the best feature of this app is the check deposit i love it  only takes a day or two for the funds to be available the entire app is easy to navigate to pay bills and check statementsi have to input my password to access additional sections of my account such as looking at statements even after using touchid that is inconvenient ,1i love chase mobile it actually was the first banking app that i knew of in atlanta where you could deposit online  i only wished the limit was higher then when depositing a twoweek paycheck it was hard to deposit much else without going over the k limit thats why you get  stars i dont care for the alerts either never can view them online,1the app has made significant improvements and continues to make even more i enjoy being able to navigate freely without having to open and close too many screens to get to where i need to be however i would like to see a list of routing numbers that coincide with my stateaccounts on the same screen  other than that developers  good job,1ive been using this app for several years and it keeps getting better  the add more features as time goes on and to date i cant think of any improvements it needs  this is not a complete substitute for certain things you can do on a laptop but a great addition to most all tasks for personal banking,1the reason why i love this app so much is because it has everything the website does it is convenient easy to use has fast transactions and updates constantly i also love how the home screen background changes depending on time of day and where you are it makes me feel comfortable and at home,1this is the best designed mobile banking app i have used i love to deposit checks pay billsquick cash transfer and all your credit card chase credit card balances and accounts are all together this app is easy to navigate through and it just makes banking easier,1i love banking with chase the online app makes depositing checks transferring money and managing my accounts fast and easy as a recent highschool graduate i was nervous managing my own accounts but this app has helped me be in control of my budget and save chase quick alerts notify me of all my purchases allowing me to be aware of my spending and prevent fraud,1love this app i know every penny i have at the click of my finger i use it daily sometimes multiple times i have the app personalized for my needs having access  allows to me transfer funds instantly send and receive money with quick pay selection pay bills timely from anywhere never received a late fee,1this app is pretty amazing it will keep your account on its toes will be informed and i really love it i think that she is one of the better apps that the banks half so i think that everybody that has a chase account should have this app and it helps me keep track of just everything sometimes even when i dont want to know whats going on,1great app can do everything from anywhere except take out actual money notifications make it great when traveling overseas my wife had a charge on her card that was not authorized we she was notified and just a simple touch of a button saying she didnt charge anything and no more problems,1i use this app for both my personal and business accounts our family has over  accounts being able to check on the accounts transfer funds and pay bills all from one home screen is invaluable great app keep the improvements coming,1i have never had any trouble with my chase online it has made doing a lot of transactions easier for me to take care of without having to leave my house  as an amputee it is sometimes very difficult just to get out of the house much less go to the bank and i really appreciate the mobile,1this app is convenient user friendly efficient and always accurate  i can easily and quickly use the app on all my electronic devices with ease  security is ongoing efficient and of the highest caliber  chase maintains communication with me on all levels of my banking experience and makes me feel important wanted and appreciated no other banking app compares,1i really like the various options for the notifications works especially good for tracking purposes if you have more than one card on the account  my only issue is not being able to clearly distinguish between multiple accounts so i find my self going back and forth trying to find the right account to view,1everything is good about this app except you took away the finger verification method what happened  please bring that method of sign in back  i dont know if there were some problems with that method of sign in or not but that was very convenient for me and a lot of other people  i rated it four stars because of that missing ingredient  bring that back and this app gets five stars,1learning to use this app is quick and easy i have never had an issue with it it isnt glitchy and always loads pretty fast i havent found anything on the desktop version that cannot be done on this app my favorite part is the quick glance in the start up swipe left to view your balance,1the app is great and easy to use i work long hours and sometimes cant get to a branch before they close i can deposit my checks and do everything i would at the branch from work my car or home i have accounts with other banks and have their apps on my phone this app is by far the most user friendly,1handy to see you have an alert indicated by the red dot in the side menu but once you click view alerts you need to go on a wild goose chase to find which account the alert is for can you not have a red dot next to the account or the account name in bold on the select account screen i want to be able to clearread alerts quickly thank you,1this app has become a permanent fixture for my home screen being able to see my balances and make transfers easily is a huge help the check deposit feature is cool and works well though i still prefer using atms for that still i probably bank more through this app than i do online,1this app is very useful to all those people who rely on their banks mostly for their part on handling their money i havent had any problems with the app yet but im sure i wont i was amazed on how fast the push alerts appear on your screen as soon as you use the card so im pretty much satisfied with the app and definitely feel secure,1have to agree with others here that there are some bugs to fix lately ive been getting an unexpected error when trying to deposit checks the errors went on for days i live  miles from the nearest branch so i depend on the app its frustrating when it doesnt want to work right otherwise the rest of the features are nice,1i bank at  different institutions but primarily utilize chase easy to transfer  between banks once verified also quick pay is excellent as is the alerts on activity over a certain amount only thing missing is credit score which capital one has but credit karma takes care of that separately,1very useful i also have apps for a couple of credit unions and they are not near as functional as their websites the chase app gives me all the website does as far as i need perhaps there are functions missing but i have not found plus the direct check deposit and fingerprint authentication,1two features that make the app valuable are the ability to transfer funds and the abundance of alert options also love the ability to view images of the checks that have posted both front and back would like to see a login pin option added very functional and easy to navigate,1i love being able to deposit checks from home and not having to leave home or im out of town i also find it extremely helpful when i need to do a quick transfer to my children or just being able to transfer money from one account to the other,1i use many banking apps and i must say that this app is probably the best my one complaint is that remote deposits are currently limited to   im not sure why there is this limit when i know other banks have higher deposit limits i use the app for many deposits but still often have to go to a branch because deposit limits are low increase the app deposit limit,1would love it there was touch is to log on with your thumb print i would use it more typing a password is a pain when you are in a hurry i also wish that there was a  hour warning to make a deposit before we are charged with an overdraft i think that once its overdraft i tend to leave it but if i can avoid an overdraft fee i would make a deposit asap sadly but its true,1ive been using the app and i really like it even the website looks like the app and is so much easier to navigate i love the fact that i can make deposits especially now that moved out of the us and still use my account to pay bills back home makes easy and very convenient since there is no branches near me,1this app works well pretty to look at easy to use but please stop naggingbegging for reviewsits so unattractive especially when weve already left a review  its not our job to promote your companysecond request add electronic billing statements ala wells fargo yes i know we can schedule payments but thats not the same as receiving the bill and making a payment based on the bill this is imperative for utilities amx and other accounts where the payment due differs monthly,1love this app been using it for almost  years with no issues i use it exclusively since there are no chase branches in my state the check deposit feature is fantastic what makes the app so great is that anything you can do on the website you can do through the app  i no longer go the browser version,1i like how you can use touch id to do simple things like check balances but then have to enter in my password to move money to pay bills its just another layer of security that i like i also like that you can transfer money to accounts at other banks from the mobile app and dont have to go online to do it,1why not have us input the due date of our various bills when we set up or edit our payers and send a text that the payment is coming due a day or two before and one again on the due date that would be exceptional service just an idea,1i love this app easy to use and clear i can make transfers between accounts easily see my acctrouting s in case i need them i wish my history had a search option bc sometimes i need to look for a specific transaction and its  tedious scrolling until i find it other than that i love the simplicity and efficiency of the app,1this chase app is perfect for me i dont have much time getting to the bank for any type of transaction being able to view my account at anytime is very convenient having the app at my fingertips allows me to monitor all purchases and checks cleared i would recommend the chase app to all chase bank customers,1ive always found this app extremely easy and useful now that ive been deployed for a few months its been a lifesaver ive seen on here that people are upset because things dont clear quick enough for them but that seems to be vendor waiting not chase ive had nothing but good service from this app,1i love the quick pay feature sometimes im out amp dont have any money amp my husband or family member is able to send me money in less than  minutes i gave  stars because im so disappointed that they removed the chase atm out of walgreens i know that doesnt have anything to do with the actual app but i hope someone reads this amp put chase atm back in walgreenss stores,1i love the app for everything except i get messages telling me my due date is  days away even after i scheduled a payment prior to the due date  i would like to have text messages sent when i schedule a payment and also when the payment posts so i dont keep having to log in to double check,1i generally really enjoy this app however twice ive paid to old payee accounts since the app will list them all even though ive hidden obsolete payees through the desktop version the first time i thought it was my error but after that incorrect transaction i doubled checked my payee statuses so when it happened this time i was able to figure out the problem please fix this,0with chase streamlining the app to make it easier to see statements and purchases they have lost all the bells and whistles that made it great i literally have the app and no longer use it because its just statements i have lost the ability to see anything about my home loan credit card features etc i have to login to the main webpage to do much of anything now even paying cards is a pain now on the app takes me  mins to find the pay features,1i use this app to manage my credit card  recently i lost it and did not have immediate access to my paper statement to pull up my number and account info along with a contact number  it was all readily accessible from the app and i was able to use the contact number to speak with a representative immediately to resolve my situation,1the overall chase app is fine however the ultimate rewards section needs some work it crashed the app three times in a row when i tried to access the menu after making an large number of button pushes to even get there can we get a separate app for the ultimate rewards it would facilitate shop through chase and booking reward travel,1best banking app love it has made keeping track of everything so much easiertook away  star because it gives alerts for my acct but when i click alert it doesnt tell me which accountcredit card the alert is for so i have to click through all the accounts to see which has the most recently dated alert please fix this then itll be a  star app,1this app works perfect for me on an up to date iphone banking is banking its not the most fun thing to do often apps that handle mundane tasks seem to try and make up for that and get in the way this app is easy to navigate and has a simple ui i get done what i want to get done quickly and move on the app does a great job verifying the actions ive completed,1hello everyone who reads this review of this applicationsince i installed this application it has simplified my life in terms of handling my accounts to deposit a check i do not have to queuing at the bank or wait at atms if i have a negative on one of my accounts or if i want to make a quick  pay to another person in a two by three i can do it i can easily transfer money from one account to another and thus avoid any charges on my accountin my opinion this is one of the best tools that chase has created to each of its customers and i thank in advance to the creditor of this application thank you,1i have been using this app for years  it is so easy to use and i love having access to my account balances at my finger tipsive never had a problem transferring funds or looking up a transaction  i love the check deposit feature no need to drive to the bank i just snap a few pics and im done,1its not bad but definitely needs work super convenient main problem i have is that some times youll take a picture of a check and go through the motions of depositing and youll notice  days later it doesnt show in your account ive been using the app for  year specifically for this i think i know how to use it  i definitely need something more reliable on top of that theres no way to review your processed amp deposited check history ,1the app works for multiple things check your accounts payments international transfers and pps but the app also offer the management of your rewards points and the interface is slow and unstable the app should also have the fingerprint id option i got apps for other  banks and chase is the only one without the option,1i have accounts with multiple banks both big and small and chase is the only app without touch id for a major bank to not have this as an option on their app is annoying because i have to lookup my password every time i log in i keep complicated passwords so im not able to memorise them other than that the app is easy to use and works fine for me,0i did like the app for most online banking however i had to delete this app from some of my devices due to a software upgrade from chase that broke compatibility with several of my older devices the strange thing was the app continued to receive alert notifications from chase but i could not log into the site to clear out those alerts for that device its pretty amazing that several of my other banking apps for other banks continue to work on those same older devices for my kids my parents and other family members,0frustrating the mobile deposit sometimes does not pick up the correct account number on a check in the past this was not a problem as the app would allow me to manually fix the incorrect number now i dont see that option i tried  times to deposit a check but had to cancel as it keeps picking up an incorrect number please fix  otherwise i am happy with the app,1all features that i would want work really well  depositing checks viewing account history etc  more functionality than most apps which only have a small fraction of the features of the full website  this has pretty much everything youd need,1ive had no issues with knowing my balance and paying my card balance it runs smooth only thing that can be fixed is if you have one account it should not take me to selecting that account like its looking for me to select from many for payment not a big deal though,0chase has added advertising offers that pop up over the header of the screen when you log in they are annoying make it hard to see your information and there is no way to shut them off  they force you to look at them and dismiss them unlike alerts which you can turn on or off in settingsvery disappointed in you chase please turn these offers off and let me get back to managing the money that ive entrusted you with and stop using my phone as a way to force your advertising down my throat,1have the people complaining about pending balances even used this app its pretty straightforward and shows all pending activity i can do most of my banking on my phone except withdraw  obvs and set up travel alerts not sure why thats not available yet other than that its easy to use and should be even for the most technically challenged who still balance their checkbooks,1ive worked with the app pretty much daily for months checking the account for activity using the different features checking payments and balances as well as transactions etc and it works really well love having all my account information at my finger tips right on my iphone  stars the app is perfect,1this is a really great app and i basically do  of my banking through ithowever the way it prompts me for updates is so annoying i enter my super long secure password only to be promoted for a mandatory update and then when its all said and done i have to enter my super long password again just tell me theres an update before i put the password in,1all i can say is is is been a lifesaver no more telephone calls and waiting and you know i can pay my bill they use my fingerprint reader on an iphone  and i just its just you ever design this in a really nice job now the question is in rea lity will they leave it alone because it works and very well at that cvl,1i am able to do a lot of my banking with the chase app  there are limits on daily and monthly deposits that can be made using it but it is useful most of the timethe popups trying to get you to switch to electronic statements are annoying  i guess chase is hoping that someone accidentally presses accept and has to pay to get regular statements again,1i wouldve given  stars but the process to remove push alerts is far too clunky and time consuming alerts should be in the sidebar right when you log in and users should have the ability to delete them from there instead of the current process adding touch id to access the app pushed my rating of  stars to  so bravo on that move,1really like the ease of use no problems so far previous problems have been fixed that i was experiencing only feature i miss that i had at another bank was if you sent money you would get a email or text telling you your money had been sent then again when it was deposited successfully to other persons account,1i love all the features available through online banking its super reliable make your deposits online send money immediately through quick pay pay my bills online makes having to go to the bank a thing of the past get it,1love the app the only problem ive had is when it or apple does an update and i end up having to change my password because it locks me out saying i have tried to access too many times not sure why this has happened and hopefully that problem has been corrected,1chase mobile makes banking on the fly easy and convenient users can make remote deposits transfer money within personal accounts and send money to others via chase quick pay the app even functions well in areas with low coverage,1easy to use and i can see transactions immediately  only thing i had issue with is when i was on vacation and tried to transfer some money from one account to another it didnt recognize my location  i had to call cs and was on the phone for quite awhile but eventually got it worked out,1not sure what everyone elses issues with the app have been but it seems to work just fine for me  of the time i havent had issues with fingerprint id or paying through the app i probably only sign in  times a month to make a payment or check the balance,1the chase mobile app is convenient easy to use and fairly uncomplicated the issue i have is the text alerts from the app and online banking site are not in sync with each other or with my actual account balance the alerts are always behind so i still have to open the app or log onto the website to get the real time balance,1ive been using banking apps for several years this one has improved over the last several years although after a recent update ive had to redeposit checks several times before they are recognized i use  different banks apps on an iphone overall this is one of the better apps for online banking ive seen,1glad to have an app to work with but here are some of my frustrationsthe app continually forgets my phone and reverses my touch id login preference with each update my other banking apps never do thisthe forgot password ux is difficult to follow and the error messaging is generic and often misleading eg it says the password does not meet requirements when i really just need to confirm the pw in a field that is covered by the keyboardwhile there is a lot of functionality in the app the key details i really want to see about my account are hidden several layers down i also see misapplications of my payments and reversalsfixes almost every month i would hope your autopay solution could apply payments correctly without retroactive accounting solutions,1appreciate the quick review feature but the touch id is touch and go sometimes coming on erratically during signin the menu bar needs to be smoother in navigating to essential information otherwise i find this quite useful for my current needs it would get a star rating once those glitches are corrected,1im contractor i get checks almost everyday the best part for me is using the app to make all those deposits i only have a limit of k a day but next morning is available to deposit another k so far none of the checks has been put on hold for a long time but no doubt this app has make my life easier,1the chase app is amazing its so convenient and easy to use i even convinced my sister a long time customer to a competitive bank to give it a try and loves it its so easy to use and really has pretty pictures on the login and balance screen of whatever major city you may be in sending money is so easy and fast,1i love the chase app much better than the bank of america app but on the  update the app now works considerably slower where it gets anoying compared to how quick it was i deleted the update and synched the old chase app from my itunes library until they correct that issue ill give my  stars when they speed it up ,1so far so good this application is the best online application from any of the us largest banks the online deposit option works amazingly i can deposit my checks just in front of any of my customers of course i ask if they have sufficient funds first overall very complete app the transactions tracking menu is very complete,1it would be nice when you go to pay your card through this app that you get an option to pay the last statement balance seems like the most obvious choice instead of the minimum due total amount currently outstanding or other  it makes it seem like they do not want you to have that option  also it would be nice to see any previously scheduled payments that have been set up,1this app is useful but the push notification that you cannot remove is really annoying  ive done everything conceivable to remove that  message alert on the app but nothing works  i even sent an email and was directed to do what i had already tried must be a bug  needs to be fixed  come on tech people,1do you want an app that allows you to lose   even  pounds of unsightly belly buldge   i know i did  but then i found chase and those things didnt matter as much for a moment   i was able to check all of my accounts in just one easy location  i could deposit a kings ransom i could pay my bills all with a pleasing blue background,1after reading all these reviews im curious if there is even a new chase app ive received the same email about updating before the th my app now is fine and i updated the first time to the ios i do have another ios update in my settings that says i need hmmmim thinking i wont update either oh and i gave  stars for the old app ,1ive had nothing but a good experience with the app  super easy to check my balances make payments and transfer money  i even deposited a checksaved me a trip to the bank  i have another bank app and its super confusing menus in weird places and just kind of ugly to look  chase is super user friendly in comparison,1ive had very little problems with this app or chase in general but the newest implementation of a completely arbitrary mobile deposit limit per month is just sort ofdumb mobile deposit has been a huge time savior for me and now just isnt i cant wrap my head around how giving chase too much of my money is like inconvenient for them or something otherwise we cool,1it is very easy to use and i have never had any issues with the app i use it on a daily basis to ensure that fraudulent charges have not been posted to my account or to see if my purchases have been posted and it updates immediately i really like being able to transfer money and pay bills from the app,1the most recent version has a cleaned up interface that suites the app on ios my two nits are that some of the dialogues are still using a heavy sarif font while the rest of the ui is using a light sanssarif font its visually jarring and inconsistent and although it is old school id like to be able to see pictures of my cashed checks without going to the desktop web interface,1the new background graphics and fonts look nice however its impossible to separate charges based on billing cycles and to keep things somewhat organized from a functionality and feature perspective the app has take a leap back from the look and feel it has taken a couple of steps forward now if chase could just make the next version the best of both worlds well all be in business,1i have been using this app for years and love the new version and particularly the check deposit option which saves a trip to the bank  however i also use this for our business account and am still frustrated that i cannot view the details of incoming wire transfers which means i dont know which customer a payment is from  otherwise i am very happy  thanks chase,1i will start with the negative when we deposit our checks they have a limit and i hate that we live  hours away from chase bank and we feel the quick deposit should be higher than what it is it puts us in a bind having to drive that far because of their limits other than that love the app its convenient i can keep track of our account love that,1i love the app and love my chase account  mostly use app to check balances and pay bills  it never has a problem  i use atm to deposit checks and withdraw money never have a problem  i visit my favorite branch to say hi and because i am shopping in the store they are located in  always friendly staff and always the best service  i will never switch banks,1i am not typically a fan of the bigger banks but i will say that i  a fan of this one not only the bank but this is one of the more user friendly apps i have ever utilized in the banking world i have not had one issue with any mobile deposits and i love the other functions that just make my life easier highly recommend,1i always get a tiny bit confused making a payment but thats because i only use the app once a month to make a vehicle payment i wish chases systems interfaced though whether its the app or the website they have no idea if you schedule a payment or transfer unless you call amp tell them i find it amazing that in this modern age they dont have systems that communicate better,1ive had chase for years and the app since ive had an iphone never had an issue the app is extremely user friendly and one night i saw my boyfriends banking app compared to chases and chases at the time and still seems to be way ahead of the game in features he was poking around and surprised at what is standard for a chase user that his banks app doesnt even offer,1this app is actually pretty awesome i mean there isnt too much in the way if bells and whistles but its incredibly easy to use and gets the job done also i love the cash a check using the camera and easy wire transfer features they make life so much easier when youre on the go all in all great work chase and keep it up,1this app saves my teenage kids from going hungry or getting stranded all the time ive had the app since it became available i use it a lot to transfer money to a high school amp college account for my boys that think my funds never run out its a great app use it daily i enjoy taking a pic of a check amp depositing right from my phone very very useful app,1this app has always been perfectly fast and stable in my experience it is full featured and easy to use however i really wish the developers would integrate touch id support discovers app has had that for at least a year now also the app looks ridiculous on my iphone  plus why hasnt this app been updated to officially support the resolutions of the iphone  i wish chase would keep up with the advances in technology offered by apple,1i was fine with the app until the recently removed the counter for the  of transfers from savings to checking to help one know exactly when to consider making them before now receiving a drop dead make one more and youre getting charged email the counter used to display telling you how many out of how many remaining and it made so easy to plan out your moves bad idea to remove this simple function,1love this app especially now that chase has increased the daily deposit amount i have a small business account and i love the convenience of being able to deposit checks by phone the convenience is enormously helpful to a small business owner who runs all aspects of the company by herself thanks chase,1ive only been a chase customer for several month what ive come to realize is how helpful they are they make banking a breeze the on line app is very user friendly and gives my a quick look at all my accounts no more pulling my hair out trying to find mistakes i just sign on and compare my numbers against theirs,1this app not only works well but chase continues to improve it i am especially appreciative of chases leading the banking industry in security and fraud detection i took a new chase card and used it once getting gasoline chase quickly asked me if i had made a purchase  miles away the card was compromised and i had a new card the next day well done,1outstanding this is the word thats sums up the application im only a credit card user so my point of view is simple from the easy to set up and use biometrics to the justintime notifications and ease of making payments to credit cards the chase mobile app has it right thanks chase,1this is one of the many reasons i will never leave chase they have award winning internet banking and apps they are monthsyears ahead of the competition yes they have fees like every other bank in this country dont be stupid with your money get direct deposit and you will never have to worry about those fees,1this app is the sh  ive been with chase since high school and i remember downloading the app when it first came out i thought i was best thing since sliced bread   i use it everyday to manage my spending and its easy to navigate it also features the quickpay feature which i love kudos to the people at chase for creating the best app ever  sincerely a happy customer,1like its online counterpart its a nice functional application that is somewhat cluttered compared to the competition  and a little more cumbersome it looks great and has most of the features you want but unlike bank of america it lacks a check image view and with simple things like bill pay activity you have to maneuver around multiple screens to see all the info,1i love when touch id was added to the app but unfortunately it rarely works does not present the screen i found that in the past i could close the app and restart it and then it would prompt for touch id  now that doesnt work either  another app i use datavault works flawlessly every time  not sure why a company as big as chase cant get it right  otherwise the app is acceptable and gets the job done for me,1since my cell is my only connect besides my desk top i find this app a real help havent ever had any trouble with it and it has been a life saver when i needed to transfer funds maybe a couple of minor inconveniences that might take and extra ten seconds but nothing worth getting irritated over over all it is a really good app,1i like the app and i feel that it has some great security aspects to it  but lately it has been not recognizing my password on a regular basis after about  weeks of use so i have to change it and then change it again  weeks laters and so on  its getting pretty annoying and im not sure the reasoning or the cause for this is  other then that the app is pretty helpful and spot on,1i love this app it allows me to avoid having to walk into a branch for practically everything its easy to navigate and im a senior citizen ive used the app to deposit checks to transfer funds between accounts and to pay bills along with more routine functions im comfortable using it and have never encountered a problem or an error,1i love the app especially the preview feature but there is one thing that has changed that annoys me  it used to be that if i touched businessselect chkg it would show the current balance and available balance that was convenient if id made deposits that hadnt posted yet rather than having to do the math when it is still listed as pending when looking at the regular available balance,1i love being able to check my balance no matter where iam and to keep track of all transactions i love setting up the alerts i was able to catch a fraudulent transaction while it was still only pending this app just makes banking easier i really cant see myself without it now lol,1i can deposit a check relatively new which gives me access to almost anything i need without traveling to a branch  not to mention  access  i am still taking the time on occasion to visit my kouts in branch though because the folks there are the truly my friends  they care about me and prove it time after time,1i switched my banking years ago to chase because of their forward thinking and implementation of the latest technology this app is by far the most user friendly and does it all i send wires transfer money manage bill pay and view all my account activity from my phone thanks chase  i also love the new atms,1wish my other banking accounts were this easy to access and maneuver through clean look easy navigation only thing i would change is being able to easily differentiate which branches have the drivethru on the locator having  kids i prefer to not drag everyone out just to drop by the atm ,0this app used to be great however lately none of my settings seem to stick how i set them therefore i count on notifications to keep me from accruing od fees seems like it picks n chooses when to notify me and also ive opted for the easy swipe so i wouldnt have to sign in everytime i want a balance but it only stayed that way once still having to sign in every time so annoying i can tell they just want to be able to charge me a fee as if i had extra money for that if i cant even cover my own bills why take more money from me that i dont have ,1this app is great  the ability to deposit a check using your phones camera is priceless it was a little buggy when the app first came out a few years ago but they fixed that shortly thereafter and now the app is flawless in my opinion easy to use great features what more could you ask for,1everyone complaining about having to use their passwords is so whiny you can access you main portal using touch id balance where you have made purchases and for how much etc but if you want to do anything with your points or make a payment you have to enter your actual passcode i dont mind the extra security at all,1saves me so much time over having to take checks to the bank  the linking feature allows me to see and manage all of my accounts again saving me tons of time and energythe only thing i wish it did was go right to the account referenced when you get an alert instead of having to hunt through the accounts to see which account had the alert,1i love using my chase app it has everything there convenient for me whenever i need it transferring funds paying bills setting up alerts i absolutely love the swipe option to just check my balance for my accounts i like the ease the accuracy and how quick it is this app has never failed me,1i love this bank and the app is just great as the bank the only thing that i would like to see is add an option for the amount you want to pay on automatic payments because now it only gives two options either pay the minimum due or the whole balance,1i really appreciate being able to transfer money and manage my finances instantly the app is very organized and easy to use i especially enjoy being able to quickly see an overview of my accounts without logging in so far i have not had any issues with the app,1since i got my iphone and my chase account i have been able to manage my money very efficiently and effortless some tasks may require various confirmations but like in simple life measure twice cut once good job chase improvements always and still some people will resist changes but eventually even other institutions follow chase innovations,1love the chase app thumbprint sign in on iphone  is so easy and convenient perfect for a quick check of account or to pay my bill chase has also protected me twice from credit card theft been very helpful during the process and refunded all the fraudulent charges integral part of my financial experience thanks so much chase,1this app is so easy i love that i can take pictures of my checks to make deposits gone are the days of racing to the bank several miles away to make my deposit i also love that i can transfer money between accounts this app makes my life so much easier now if i can just get it to make my bed and do the dishes ,1i simply love this app it makes my life easier by saving me trips to the bank photo deposit and online bill payment yes that last option is available online too but its common for me to get a bill in the mail grab my phone or ipad and schedule the bill to pay the day before its due thanks chase,0you decided not to support the iphone  original operating system as i cant update the phone i can no longer use your app rendering it worthless please support all software versions geez the phone isnt even that old  my company still has to support our website on ancient internet explorer browsers not everyone can keep up with rapid technology well i guess i will now go back to the dark ages and sit with your reps in the branches to process every paper check and check my balances isnt that costly for everyone thanks a lot,0i hate this app i consider my self pretty tech savvy my job is to teach a specific computer program and im in my late s i hate having to use this fracking app so much its not intuitive ive had to change my password a billion times it constantly asks my for my password even though i have the finger scan on it makes me want to leave chase just so i never have to use it again i have completely lost patience with this app and my boyfriend has talked me off a ledge by offering to call customer service for me chase mobile app you blow chunks,1fast efficient interface plenty of features i can get done what i need to do with my various accounts from my iphone  mobile access sure beats paper transactions at the bank it wasnt that long ago that we drove our horses and buggies to the branch to do paper transactions with people called tellers ,1with how things are now a day that all information is needed at the moment this app helps you stay up to date with whats going on without having to call the bank in just seconds you can know if you have the funds for any transaction this app is a most have dont leave home without it,1a musthave for single busy moms with teenagers no matter where i am or my children are i can instantly transfer money from my account to theirs through the app my clients can send me a quick pay as soon as services are rendered i can pay my credit card bill with the touch of a button i love it,1i like this app it would be nice if your payments would reflect right away when done on your current credit card balance and if i didnt have to enter my password every time it needs to have the apple touch id overall i use this app every day and its a good way to keep track of my finances with chase bank,1i continue to find new features that make it easier to track my money this app is not missing any feature that i expect from a bank app my favorite function is depositing checks i receive a few a month and its easy to take care of them right away if only they could teach it to dispense cash,1i have never had any trouble with this app it never shuts down freezes up or gives any other problems appreciate the quality  it makes things very easy when i need to review my account or pay my bill i also appreciate the notices that i receive when i have made a purchase on my chase visa card,1chase keeps this updated and with new features check deposits are easy and they were one of the first no need to go to the branch except for the most important of transactions i use this app daily to keep track of where all my accounts are,1the chase app only gets better and better love the ease of use whether depositing a check transferring money to fellow chase members pay bills or checking our accounts each day love this app if i only had one app to choose to keep on my phone this would be it thank you for making my hectic life a bit easier,1its good that they have a chase bank app because you can easily keep track of what is spent and it tells the status of the payment if its pending or made instead of writing it in your notes or paper or keeping a receipt its helpful but it doesnt pay for you just a practical app,1why is it so hard for other banks to figure out i have multiple accounts but chase is far and away distanced itself from competition i have been almost forced to use chase exclusively due to the significant performance lead in transfers deposits and payments i even wired money for property transaction from my phone very well done,1miss some of the ease of use from previous versions liking the touch id thoughi dont use any advanced functions but for balancing and noting processed checks its consistently smooth and easy to open also the ability to view the check images helps when ive forgotten to enter one in my log,1the app works every time i use it to pay bills including my car payment i have through chase the only thing i would like to see improved is to have fingerprint sign in for iphones capitol one has this and it just makes it so much easier to sign in rather than having to type a password every time all in all it is a good app,1this app allows me to quickly view the status of all our chase accounts i use it daily check deposit is a terrific feature really like the update that shows copies of checks written i agree with the previous reviewer the alert feature is irritating i have turned this feature off,1this application does everything i need it to seamlessly from depositing checks to reviewing account statements and paying credit cards i cant think of any negatives to write about just a great intuitive application that lets you manage your banking from your mobile device highly recommended,1my only reason for not giving it  stars is  things i wish it kept and showed a running balance on the credit card information after each transaction like my my other cards do  and i cant wait until they raise the deposit limits so i can deposit any check  other than that it is very user friendly and the best banking app out there,1having switched my business from a rival bank i can testify to the superb quality of this app and the chase website i am able to do all of my banking without ever setting foot in a branch if there were a way for the app to print money and help me avoid the atms im sure chase would have figured out how to do that too,1i really like this app it makes banking and credit card usage very simple all your credit card and banking info i one place is great i have never experienced a crash or weird bugs in this app i absolutely hate the standard picture of the older woman and dog i love dogs and all their other picture but for some reason i hate the standard picture i hope they change it soon,1i just use this app for the basics im a college student so i just need to be able to quickly log on which im able to do and check my balance and also transfer money as well as accept money transfers its a good app rarely crashes on me its an appdont do huge transactions on it why would ppl do that anyway ive had this app for years since about  recommend,1i rarely use apps but i use this one all the time i can use it from my phone or laptop and its easy to use even for people who are not very tech savvy my only complaint is that i had to start this review over  times after learning that previous nicknames were taken it didnt seem to save my review last attempt,1while the prolific nature of their branches and atms had a significant influence on my decision the strength of the mobile app and quickpay were major reasons i switched to chase when it comes to mobile banking nobody does it better i have yet to come up with a complaint about the app after more than two years of use,1i seriously couldnt function without quick payi just wish that they let the fingerprint login be fine for using quick pay it is stupid to make me enter my password to use these features either the fingerprint scan is safe or not  entering password is such a hassle,0its great that we use our thumbprint to log in but its really annoying that we have to enter our itunes password for everything after that like making a payment and even rating this app please either remove all subsequent verifications or make them all the thumbprint also the homepage needs more immediate information like available balance minimum payment and due date having to search for this basic information is infuriatingthank you,1ive only been using this app for a little over a month and find it easier to navigate than when i access through my desktop computer will probably be using the app more than the desktop since its so much more convenient and less hassle free,1extremely convenient ive had it for about  years and no major problems easy to add payto accounts and schedule payments on that note chase should make it faster to pay to payto accounts for example i get paid on thursdays and when i want to schedule a car payment to another bank it can take  days thats ridiculous,1definitely my best credit card app easy to navigate easy to use mobile banking is here to stay and this app is one of the reasons excellent app for nearly all your banking needs definitely recommended i just wish i could figure a way to adjust the app to make my credit card bills go away,1i love this app and ive used it for years to manage my main checking my kids accounts and credit card account along with my earned pointsi also deposit checks remotely and transfer money between accounts pay bills from account and send money to family monthly,1i really like the app and i really like the accessibility it took some time to get use to as i have been using the pnc mobile app for so long like pncs mobile app i wish there was a calendar option to view average daily balance as well as the ability to see the amount of pending depositswithdrawals at a quick glance other than that i really like the ease of the app amp that it is quick,1functional and accessible never had any glitches or inconveniently timed updates the quick pay feature is amazing as are most other features if they could figure out a way to let the app photo scan and deposit checks it would be absolutely perfect but its very good asis,1i use this app all the time i love the convenience and information it provides i have several accounts and it is so easy to see them all at once quick pay is the best i appreciate being able to transfer funds easily being able to see image of check now on app is super loyal chase customer,1chase has done a great job with their mobile app which is responsive and very well designed with a clean and intuitive interface and they appear to be doing a good job of innovating on the platform id like to see the ability to look up past payment info but thats a small quibble,0easy to spend your money but hard to pay your debts this addon really rakes in that mentality so does the website by making it hard to really recover lost information in case you only see it once a month before you pay and forget the money went away into a magical place of bank heaven im not sure what im more upset about jumping through hoops to get logged in or the fact it feels like the app and the company itself is rooting for me to be late on payments and trying to make me occur late fees by making the account pretty inaccessible,1i love this app i use it for paying my bills transferring money from one account to another and checking my balances and cashing checks but i sure would like to use my fingerprint to be able to login most apps now are doing that and that would be a big upgrade hopefully that can be done in the futurenear future,1chase is the best of the best like no lie im not saying this to tickle their ears but you guys are truly the best in all honesty my mom has been using chase for almost  years i guess you could say and this is my first year  im absolutely in love with chase i would never ever go with any other crappy banking system ex wells fargo and others because it cant get any better than chase,1i use my chase app on a regular basis i like the new update as its more user friendly i like the touchid was fixed as i had issues in the past but now it works fine i also like the transfer money menu this update made it simple and easier to transfer funds between accounts,1one word seamless i am able to use this app to do all of my banking from depositing checks to transferring funds to calling the bank if i need something i love being able to transfer funds to other account holders in seconds and i love the touch id to sign inchase makes all of my banking needs available at my fingertips,1i really enjoy using this app its easy to use it saves me a bunch of trips to the bank i can transfer money within my accounts like checking and savings so it saves me the trip to the bank and the overcharge fees and i can also check all of my activity i really enjoy the new login option of just using your fingertip,1the best bank account management app out there quick easy convenient  chase needs to put in a finger security and access option in and allow the app to pay bills from savings directly without a need to transfer into current checking accounts otherwise super reliable app,1i like that i can access all my statements from the beginning of my account opening unlike other banks chase doesnt make me ask to see amp wait for approval for statements from  years out amp older easy signins amp easy to navigate from one account to the next if you have more than one with chase,1i use this app multiple times a day to manage my checking savings and credit accountsit allows me to monitor and manage my accounts efficiently with an intuitive and simple user interface the apps touchid integration is near seamless allowing me to complete tasks fasteri highly recommend the chase app to anyone who banks with chase,1love the app much better than other banking apps ive used set the app to update automatically so you dont have to log out and update when they are available great functionality still wishing chase would increase their mobile deposit limits but that has nothing to do with the app functionality gj developers,1this isnt my dominant card so granted i may not use the app enough to have run into potential issues but its easy to see my card balance and payment due dates the overall layout is appealing and i have never had issues making payments through the app,1this is a c+ grade as far as banking apps go the graphics are decent and its usually responsive i like being able to search for individual merchants credit card charges by name but the apps from both of my other two financial institutions small credit unions use touch id to speed up logging into the app this feature is table stakes  any serious bank the size of chase should be embarrassed that they dont offer this as well,1the app is user friendly in my opinion sending money via quick pay is a breeze and paying the credit card from your checking account is no problemi dont have much complaints except that the app goes down for maintenance often however thats a plus because issues are resolved that way,0so recently i moved money with this fabulous app to my sister she then moved some of the money back using the same app as sisters you know this happens often well recently she moved the money to me and it mysteriously was sent to a boa account neither one of us or have a boa account first they take over  days to provide a solution  not one time offering to refund the money and then theychase is refusing to refund  im not very happy about this at all and i wonder how many other customers out there have they done this to,1i love being able to take care of my banking on my phone it makes my life so much easier sometimes the app glitches and wont login itll just show the loading page for a while but that doesnt happen often other than that i love all the things i can do within the app instead of having to drive all the way to the bank,1i love the app my previous bank app was so ridiculous i could never understand it it would never even tell me the balance in my account chases mobil app is great i like all the advanced features i am so happy to make such a big switch i know it would definitely make a difference on how my manage my account,1i used this app both on my iphone s amp the mini tablet it works great on both i really like the touch security which has never failed i also use this app to deposit checks using the camera that feature sometimes does not focus well amp i would have to take several shots before i had a good picture i have had no problems with the checks depositing in my account,1there should be a new background picture every season and every month even for like breast cancer awareness something pink leukemia something orange or the alzheimers awareness something purple it should be like everyone elses app holiday decor and festive i love my walmart and sams club apps they are too cute they have like colorful lights on one and drizzling snow on the other soon as it hit december   at pm,1chase did a great job on this update i was dreading getting used to a new way of banking but it is very intuitive amp pleasant on the eyes some reviewers actually complained the text is too readable too big people could look over their shoulder well i do my banking at home i dont need to check my balance at the register good job programmers,1a very user friendly app which seems to put the customer first in that the quick view is so simple and provides the information i need with a simple swipei have used several other banking apps and this one provides a high quality service without any sacrifice in security,1nice update  this version to high tech for me  im old school person i am  years old i the last year version better  this version to high tech for me  this version slows down my old iphone  plus  i updated to iphone  plus faster but i still use my old iphone  plus this version slows it down,1its nice to be able to do all my basic banking and money work from my phone moving from checking to savings arranging transfers and payments and even building autopays into the system are so much more convenient when i do can do it right as im thinking of it helps me keep my budget tight and everything accounted for,1i love chase amp i love their app its efficient for the most part i feel secure checking my balance before and after a transaction as most of the times it reflects as soon as the purchase is made sometimes different purchases take a few days to show but its my effective way of balancing my checkbook i love you chase,1the biggest issue i have with the app is failures to complete actions most often when i use remote check deposit  of the time it has issues or doesnt complete the deposit also they have added redundant picture confirmation screens that slows the deposit process in a most annoying manner just a so so app on my opinion i cringe every time i use it hoping it will do what is supposed to do,1this app has been great i love being able to view both credit cards pay my balance redeem my rewards etc all in one place easy to use and good navigation thru system that makes sense help me be able to track mine and my husbands expenses quickly easily and accurately,1ive been using the app for years chase was the first to have one of this kind and the functionality continues to improve it is essential for my on the go banking needs especially since my current city doesnt have a chase branch maybe in the next version itll allow my phone to dispense money,0this app does the basics but its really behind compared to competition on a lot of things first off all similar apps now have touch sign up on this one you need to type your password every single time second it allows you to filter youre charges by text but does not offer a simple sum of the results whats the use of a filter if you have sum the results manually then it doesnt categorize youre charges like many other cards do overall very basic i would say,1so far so good i got my chase freedom card as a balance transfer card and thats great in itself but this app makes it very easy to transfer from my other card and monitor my account all in one place also chase orders great customer service and account security features  i always know what happens with my account,1i really appreciate the chase app i pay all my bills from the app check my statements from the app and occasionally deposit checks i have a chase credit card and the app makes it super easy to check my balance and statements and pay the bill right from the account page super convenient thanks chase,1with all the bad reviews i thought id add a positive review  i especially like the fact that when i sign out it doesnt ask me the annoying are you sure question  i have had the touchid do a reset but ive seen that on other apps and wonder if its ios issue   ive never experienced a crash which i have on other banking apps and the accounting is correct and readable  a good app overall,1ive been using this app for a few yrs now its very userfriendly not sure what others are complaining bout i have an ancient iphone  ive used it internationally as well  i have a kid in college and one in high school and often i have to send money immediately within seconds it hits their account thank u for this absolute convenience,1ive had this account for years and ive been using this app with all its updates flawlessly not sure what problems everyone else is having but i bet its user error i love the ease of use the alerts everything i use it for transfers bill pay and quick pay with no issues keep up the great work,1this is the first mobile banking app ive ever used im pretty pleased with it its easy to use easy to navigate and its surprisingly intuitive now maybe im just so new to this kind of app that im unaware of allegedly better apps then again this app may very well be what a clean adequately equipped amp featured mobile banking app is supposed to be,1there are many good features like quick pay and photo deposit you can pay all your bills and even see balances before log in nothing is perfect id like to be able to control alerts better and which account alerts pop up first but that pretty minor,1the chase mobile app is so easy to use i appreciate the simplicity of depositing checks remotely it eliminates the need to run to the atm or bank all the time i can quickly check bank balances and move money between accounts the fact that i can do this all on the go makes it even better for me it is such a timesaver,0i used to love this app but i am starting to loathe it since the last updates the  touch id only works sporadically then when i try to sign in with my user id and password it tells me ive used the wrong password and exceeded my allowed password attempts  after i know i used the right password and only entered it once i then have to reset the stupid thing it is so annoying that i cringe every time i use the app i have to turn on the touch id again and pray it works the next time i use it its exhausting,1so i got this app in my first year of college and its been amazing to have as my financial situation has progressed the app makes it really easy to keep tabs on your money pay bills and allows you to make transfers it also has a ton of resources in the touch bar to help you get acclimated would totally suggest this to a friend,1this is a great app it has pretty much all we need to know about our transactions it could be way better close to fantastically app if the application can let us know a minute after we make a purchase with a little more details about where we used it and what we bought stead of just a transaction number,1ive been using this app as long as i can remember and the only problem that i have ever had is most recently where i could not deposit of  check because it was too large an amount ive never had this problem in the past and i had to physically go to the bank which i dont necessarily mind,1this app is almost perfect there is one extremely annoying feature  when i receive an alert i have to go through several layers to finally clear it  if i dont clear thank you for scheduling your epay then the alert persists so i miss important ones like someone just charged xamount at ystoreplease make it easier to clear alerts,1every time an update is made or when anything new is offered i always worry because i am not very techno savvy but i must say i have always found chases apps to be sooo extremely easy and simple  just my style  thank you chase for providing such a smooth easy app  keep up the good work  we have been customers for  years and counting,1love my chase app but i hate that i have to wait for the touchid pop up to load and then i have to cancel it as i usually will be taking action in the app which a touchid log in does not allow id prefer a touchid button on the login screen then i have the option to put in my password to take action or tap the touchid button to only review,1i really like the online services they are are user friendly and intuitive plus you get rewards i like the convenience to pay everything with my my card and pay it off monthly no interest for paying the balance and then get points to do whatever i want or need i like the arrangement,1the app lets me do what i need to do the main thing i wish it had that my bofa app had was let you click or check a box after i had entered a transaction in my check book register yes i still do that then it is easy to quickly see what transactions i am already aware of and have tracked and which ones are new as they arent always in the same order put that option on here and i will change my review to  stars,1this app is so convenient the mobile check deposit is awesome for a while the touch id was not working a few generations back but they fixed the bugs and it works like a charm now thank you also love the convenience of being able to check balances and make transfers on my iphone,1i have two banks and chase is one of them my other bank who shall remain nameless has an app as well that one is not as userfriendly as this one i also like that with this bank i can transfer funds without getting charged any fee from chase that means they get more of my money more regularly it would be nice if they would add a touch id otherwise its a good app,1i am having trouble making a check deposithmmmm it was good until i just did the required update   it would be helpful to tell you what is wrongfrontbackamount so you only have to redo that step not the whole thing    all pics look okhow am i to know what is wrong   i use this benefit in the interest of timenot beneficial if i cant get my paycheck depositedwill overdraft fees be waived if the problem is the app,1this app is easy to use and allows me monitor both personal and business in one location i can move money deposit checks pay my credit card and cash in my reward points from anywhere anytime i have accounts with suntrust too and i can tell you that this app beats suntrust hands down,1the quickdeposit feature needs to use the light from the camera flash i tried to deposit the same check  times using different lighting and positioning in the end it failed miserably every time because of lightning and contrast issues sorry chase that money ended up at wells fargo because their app works the first time every time,0im frustrated with the app because i cant access my account with the recent update i constantly get a temporarily unavailable at this time message when im not connected to wifi and have internet connection and unable to use the touch id feature ive had to remove and download the app repeatedly and these are new problems i never experienced before with chase ive reported my issue to chase and waiting for it to be resolved,1just use it to check on credit card acct  wish it was faster to go directly to alerts  the notifications are ok but no way to delete them once viewed got a pretty huge listing now and ive read all so no need to keep them any longer otherwise no complaints easy enough to use i still use pc and web to make payments and download statements so cant comment on those aspects of the app,1i have several kids in this is so easy to use to transfer money to their account or from their account if theyre doing something theyre not supposed to do i like to check the balances theyre spending its easy to logon its easy to use its easy to pay bills with i love this app,1i would highly recommend the alerts to every chase bank account holder i believe having the alerts save me a lot of time and trouble when it comes to keeping abreast to my checking account it makes it easier to keep track of everything also  thank you chase for a wonderful business may god bless,1great ability to access and use my accounts like being able to move money and pay bill getting frustrated with the need to reauthenticate my phone every few days despite using the same phone now for  years i guess im supposed to appreciate the level of security thats on my accountupdate some noticeable improvements,1honestly its very convenient its a lovely seamless experience and they added that little button for touch id if you ever dismiss it by accident or sign off and then you want to reenter to view your account without typing in your passwordoverall i love it its an app thats mostly reliable and it never lets me down,1remember the days when if you needed banking services you actually had to go there monday through friday between am and pm  avoid lunch hours unless you planned ahead and brought a sandwich to eat while in linei truly appreciate all the effort your employees put in to ensure banking services are available  thank you chase,0its a real inconvenience to have to update the app or you wont be able to use it at all one or two times is fine i get it there are bugs or we u have to fix but seriously it seems every week now i have to update this and its really annoying especially when i dont have the space to spare on my phone the app is fine the way it is and gets the job done can you guys stop forcing us to update or at least make it so its optional so we can still actually use the app,1i enjoy checking our accounts almost daily it helps me stay up with the bill paying and automatic withdrawals that are made to our account if i need to transfer funds from saving it is so easy app and bill pay make me a chase customer now that my fingerprint is used to open my account i feel more secure  great app,1everything i need in a mobile banking app i can quickly view all my highlevel account information or delve deeper and view all my daily transactions i can easily deposit checks i can also with great ease transfer money between accounts including credit cards,1this a good example for developers to follow when designing iphone apps its a clean design and easy to navigate also love that they put in touch id to access it i cant live without that and im frustrated with apps that dont take advantage of that capability good job chase theyve also done a great job with their website app on computers,1make deposits transfer money schedule payments see history it basically does everything you would want a bank app to do there are occasional times where the app doesnt pick up your fingerprint but for the most part its a million times easier than going to my local branch,1i love this chase banking app for my acccount with chase bank lets me check immediately what my balance is in my accounts and i get my alerts on time right away to know whats going on with my finances this app helps me keep myself from not being blind about whats going on with my money this app is excellent,1too easy to use the quick pay option is so easy and convenient i pay people who do work for me who have never used technology before now are so happy to have it instead of getting checks in the mail and going to the bank to deposit them nice,1i basically wanted an app so i could check my account ballance at all times so i always knew how much money i had and this app does just that its also nice to have all the phone numbers right there in case i have a problem and need to call the atm locater didnt work as good as i hoped i found a chase atm closer to my apartment then any that showed up on the locater so points off for that but hey its free and its useful,1this app alone has been so convenient with deposits and account transfers that i no longer want to leave chase the quick check deposit is uber convenient and no longer do i have to go to a bank during my busy weeks ifwhen a check comes along,1workaroundi disabled the badges under settingsgtnotificationsgtchase after i cleared them under chasegtlogingtmoregtalerts maybe that could be a workaround for nowalso just a quirk of mine why do notifications have to say a deposit greater than  when it could be shortened and more vague like a large ach deposit its already being vague so why not remove superfluous numbers the  would just catch my attention every time and im sure im not alone,1i dont know why people find the check deposit option so frustrating i found it cool and simple you obviously have to take a clear picture and it limits  per day once i deposited minutes later i got a confirmation saying my check is accepted havent seen a better app yet highly recommended,0its a really great app i use it for couple of years now however the notifications which are some of the most valuable parts of the app because its meant to save you from fees dont work they are buried in the back of the app takes too many steps to get to them they are grouped in the way to prevent you from reading them and noticing new ones as soon as you get to the notifications section the number of new notifications is cleared so you need to use your gut to find new and important ones the alerts in the notification center are inconsistent and often are never thereall in all before chase turned off my sms notifications or broke them i was always on top of what was happening with my accounts now ive got three fees in the past  month thanks to the unreliability of their app very sad and upsetting for such a big bank,1love to be able to bank on the go really enjoy being able to snap a pic of the check i want to deposit within no time i receive notification that the check was accepted and deposited into my account also like being able to pay bills with this app at the moment to say the least i am pleased,0since ios update havent been able to electronically deposit my checks that being said it is a problem in any app on ios that wants to take a picture instagram other banks to electronically present so im not only blaming chase but i do expect chase to get a fix out soon that being said chase app on the ipad is awful of trying to electronically deposit a check as it regularly has issues with seeing  scanned on a computer printed check on the ipad it takes + tries to get a check deposited,1they should implement being able to tap on a transaction and get more information about it for example you deposit  dollars of different bill types at the atm and need to know the time and what bills you put in like xs xs xs that would be very helpful because the atm tells you but not the app,1this app has been working exceptionally well and does what it needs to whenever i need something done this is a must have app for anyone banking with chase i think all the people having trouble with this app could be a result of your carrier and your carrier coverage in your area all has been working fine for me im on a  on ios ,1i have no idea what all these others reviews are complaining about the only trouble i have logging in is when i type my entry wrong i have no problems logging in through wifi or lte i used to use the app through ipod touch before i got my iphone this app is great i have not tried the check deposit yet i transfer money between accounts pay bills no problem,1the app in general is fine but it would be nice to be able to check your messages the deposit check scanner only works sometimes update to this post still cant check messages and since an iphone only now logs into the mobile site the messages cant be checked at allupdate can no longer use deposit after taking second picture it crashesplease fix,1the commercial promising the ease and convenience of one snap and your money is instantly deposited is of course like all advertising very misleading this app takes at least  attempts to get your check deposited to your account in my humble opinion chase needs to vastly improve the ease in which you can deposit your checks via your iphone this is the primary reason i utilize this app it is sorely lacking in this department,0after the new update i can no longer make deposits over the phone by taking a photo of the check this was a truly convenient function that now shuts down the application every time i try to make a deposit the previous application whats more user friendly the recent update has new pretty new pictures but do not lend to the functionality of the application at all instead of pretty go for functional and please repair the bug that stops me from being able to deposit checks by phone,1great update in look its more updated and not dull like before one thing i would love to be addedtransaction descriptions are cut off and i cant read it all i also like writing memos on account transfers to know what my money is being transferred for can you guys add an arrow to each transaction to be able to see the full description of that specific transaction that would top this app,1this is a rhea app that allows you to do everything including remote deposit of checks my only complaint when you get an account alert it doesnt tell you which account its for with two business and three personal accounts yes cumbersome to go thru each account other than that this is a terrific app,1very useful use it daily one suggestion i wish you could display deposits grouped together by date range i need to see all of my deposits for a specific period of time and i have to scroll through every single transaction to find deposits and sometimes miss one it cant be that difficult to add a sorting function surely,1i love this mobile chase app it is so convenient move from wisconsin to florida and the town we are living in does not have a chase branch so using this app has made it very easy for us so that we did not have to change banks i love that we can make deposits pay our bills and i especially like the quick pay option,1the most recent update has some good improvements but it still only has a  maximum monthly deposit allowance between my wife and i using this app to deposit checks it doesnt take long for us to reach the  limit im not sure why the limit cant be higher but that would be something id like to see increased substantially for this app to be viable for depositing on a weekly basis,1after helping a friend pay bills via their banks website i realize how great the chase app is im able to move around easily find what i need quickly and pay bills within seconds i love it plus the vendors receive their payments the next day while other banks take  days to make the same payments,0i am fed up with chases improvements  fix the bugs and glitches behind the scenes but stop changing the user interface  this is the worst version yet that you force us to accept if we want to utilize mobile banking  when a person uses mobile banking they are just that mobile  the less distractions the better  they dont have the time or patience to muddle thru your fluffy feel good marketing crap  save that for your website  the colors are way too washed out and is very difficult to see  totally useless  two thumbs down chase,1this app is great for checking bank account activity and sending money using quick pay unfortunately i often have issues when depositing checks with the app it frequently pops up with errors and wont let me deposit the check which is a real pain because i spend a lot of time in areas where there are no physical chase branches i would give  stars if this function worked,1i probably use this app  times a week i have a checking savings and credit card account with chase this app allows me to transfer money and pay my credit card very easily i also get alerts about account activity which would immediately let me know if my card was used and i hadnt used it,0the new side menu and swipe navigation is very nice but there is no access to other chase tasks when viewing inside an account no hamburger button or bottom menu buttons i have to swipe or click back to the account overview home page in order to click the hamburger button to access other tasks the hamburger buttonside menu should be accessible from any page moving back to the last version with the bottom task buttons until this is fixed,1ive had this for about  years now and ive never had any problems using it it allows you to check you account balances transfer and wire money set up auto bill paying deposit checks with your phone camera find the nearest atm and much more,1the app has promise  however there are some glaring omissions that need to be resolved touch id  need i say more  the app does not yet use the new keyboard controls as stated in the ios design guide  the app is not  bit and is not a universal app combining the ipad app and the phone app now i do like the last update as it added the swipe feature to quickly see the remaining account balances i hope that this is brought to the apple watch as well i would also like to see apple pay  passbook integration so that all purchases made via apple pay are integrated into a purchase register in the chase app so that people can better track their purchases the inclusion of a register is something people have long asked for in this app,1i have number of accounts and the only one that i never have any issues with is chase i am not closing all other and it will only be chase there customer service is excellent never had to pay any fees get a chase account if you dont tell your friends to get one my whole family now has chase,1this app just continues to get better for the user on the move if you have chase then you definitely need to bank with this app everything is up to date and you can handle all of your accounts quickly everything is secure and i rely on this app  of the time when i am on the move,0ive had this app for a year or so and it has improved since then one thing that still drives me nuts is the alerts interface it will tell me i have an alert and i click on view alerts and the next screen shows accounts with no indication on which has the alert this has been an issue for a long time overall the user interface is clunky but its functional i guess after quick pay it should take me back to the todo list rather than prompt me to go especially when there are more entries to addresslastly youll always have  messages the same messages you get via email i used to try and keep that counter cleared but its futile theres no reason for me to read the same notifications twiceits a useful app but it is by no means an example of good ui design,1i use this app quite often and im always pleased now with the touch id its even faster its nice too see exactly were and how much money youve been spending in order to budget anyone who uses chase bank should get this app its like having the bank right in your pocket and you can even deposit checks double wow,1the mobile app update is clean and fresh like that you can view all your accounts in one place and manage push notifications in the app transfers and deposits and bill pay are also major pros for the app add the ability to log in with touch id and this app is almost flawless i use it almost everyday,1im able to do almost all of my banking transactions with it i can deposit checks by snapping a picture and easily transfer money quick pay and pay bills all from the app its a great tool for helping me monitor and manage my money anywhere with up to date information about my accounts,1i cannot imagine anymore how life was before having the convenience and functionality of this app its like having a reliable personal assistant banker and accountant all at my disposal   easy to use and push notifications and alerts let you know the important stuff without having to remember thank you chase,1been a chase bank customer for over a decade and this app is a must have for anyone on the go it offers features and conveniences far more advanced than other bank apps are providing today definitely in my top  apps i must have for any mobile device that i own highly recommended,1im pleased with this app it makes it very easy to check accounts make deposits transfer funds etc the only gripe i have is that when a notification comes through for messages it takes forever and a day and usually going in and out of that screen for my secure messages to come up and actually show other than that im pleased with it,1i like the alerts as it allows me to be aware of low balances on my childrens accounts this gives me notice that i need to transfer money instead of finding out after an overdraft occurs i like the ease at which i can deposit checks check balances and most of all transfer money between accounts,1this is the best app its clear and it allows you to state on top of your financesi stopped using my citi bank credit card because of their app and how they never gave me the whole picture of how much i owedthe quickpay pay feature is the best in the market it is the epitome of a quick pay app chase makes my life easy in so many ways,1this app has made me take control of my finances for my business and personal use the easy login fingerprint id and uptodate paperless makes me feel comfortable with all the hacking going on  also with any loan payments you can do it from anywhere i have not had one issue even with the ink card,1just loaded it havent used it in a while but circumstances prevailed and downloaded it this am so far after checking out all the bells and whistles it seems to work well looks great and responds quickly what else could you ask for  except for a deposit from a distant rich aunt to pay off your balance every now and then  holding breath fingers crossed becoming light headed its a hard knock life aint it ,1not sure why everyone is dissing this app it works perfectly for me every time granted i only ever check my balance deposit checks and redeem my points with it but those features work flawlessly would like to see the graphs with my spending in each category on the mobile app like the full site eventually,1i really like the chase mobile app everything is very user friendly and easy to use nice benign able to securely check or do banking anywhere on my phone for two years i lived in a town where there wasnt a chase branch and was still able to do everything i needed to do with this app i highly recommend it,1i have a small business and making check deposits online by logging into the app an taking pictures saves so much time not having to leave my shop   i can check my balances every day  or  times a day and im never charged for for each log in this is your bank at your finger tips love this app love this bank,1because my job im on the road up to ten months in a year this app allow me to manage my finances efficiently quickly and with no hassles at all im using it from the very beginning and i dont remember last time that i went to my bank  with this app you have your bank at your fingertips anywhere anytime,1it is super cool having my bank in the palm of my hands i spend a lot of money usually on stuff i dont need and it is nice to be able to check on my balance in seconds the alerts for deposits or withdrawals are convenient as well i have been using this app for over a year and have never had an issue i like it a lot jim carey voice,1love that they added touch id login but you still need to use your password to see a statement looking at a statement is like opening apdf like document within the app you can see due date and other information if you tap the little i next to balance also the interface is really over simplified too much for me but still a very good app to access your current cc info,1perfect for my use i mostly use it to check my account info on the go it works great for that use i like having the preview because  of the time im just checking my account balance to ensure that i have enough money for my bills coming out automatically great bill pay options,1the best feature of this app is the daily and transaction based notifications it helps me monitor usage of my credit cards and bank accounts it helps me prevent frauds by immediately being informed with my account used this should be up for a bank app award nomination,1never any issue with this app  they appear to listen to customers  yes there are things i cant seem to do that i can do on a full computer screen  manage payee info eg but it still is pretty amazing what you can do with this little piece of metal and plastic  chase had made all the normal activities seem less ina mobile,1app is so easy to use love having all my accounts available makes transferring money between our accounts so easy great way to monitor kids usage and make money accessible quickly when needed now fingerprint log in man this keeps getting better,1i use this app daily and cant recommend it enough the only changes i would make would be in regard to alerts and how to clear the alerts as it is now those with multiple accounts have to guess which one caused the alert its not clear enough when you go to the alert tab,1i love this app what i like most about it is there are no limits to it most apps are quick short cuts to help you stay connected the chase apps is exactly like the full pcmac version of online banking i rarely even use my pc to check my account or transfer money etc just another reason why i am glad to be banking with chase,1i love this app its so useful for my banking needs i mostly love the preview its quick i love being able to instantly transfer funds from one account to the next and quick pay is a life saving dream i just wish all features were available on the app as is on the website i cannot change any account info like address and email only passwords,1so i have been a chase customer since september from switching over from the devil bank of america im pretty pleased with my experience with chase thus far however the app could use some improvement and i hate having to compare it to the devil but i have to first of can we have apple id to log in i mean what is the point of having an update for ios  if your not gonna utilize it with apple id second i dont like how i cannot see my account numbers and routing numbers because then i have to go on the computer then you question whats the point of this app if i have to result to the computerbut overall im content with the app and as a customer with chase,1this app is very beneficial to someone who doesnt have time to stop at the bank no longer have to wait in line for a transaction it would be nice to have a feature where you can actually see the full routing and account numbers in the app other than that fantastic app,1i have an iphone s the touch controls absolutely fantastic i just put my thumb on it and it loads right into my accounts it is the best app of all the banking apps i have several credit cards from several different major banks and none of their apps are anything like this chase is the biggest and the best for a reason,1ive used this app for a few years i never had any problems with it its easy to use and the quickpay feature makes transferring funds to people instant and convienient i can also pay my bills on the go without using checksi have an i phone s so have the fingerprint login feature which i love id be lost without this app,1im  and opened my first account ever wth chase and when they let me know there was an app to check my account and manage it on the go i immediately downloaded it in their office its been a great resource the whole time ive had my account and i dont think id use another bank unless they have something just as good,1i love the chase app because of its versatility i can complete most transactions from the app which saves me time and trips to a branch the app is super easy to navigate and thus far i have not experienced any issues timeouts limited use bugs etc i would like to have an instant payment feature where payments and available credit using the app are made instantly,1signing in with touch id is great and i appreciate fully functional access to all my linked chase accounts on my mobile devices would give it  stars if mobile deposit did not have a limit that means i still have to get to a branch to deposit some checks but compared to some other bank apps chase is much more user friendly and functional,1this app is very detailed dependable and extremely handy chase has got a good thing going and continues to improve and update this feature its literally all we use to bank now and can use it anywhere we go the customer service part are very good as well why go anywhere else for your banking needs,1ive only had one other bank to compare this one to but i can state that this chase app is very convenient  i really like being able to take a pic to deposit checks  i also enjoy the notifications i have set through my settings that keep me from having to check constantly even when i forget k should check very pleased indeed,1i have accounts with half a dozen banks and this is undoubtedly the best mobile banking app i can do all my banking on the train into work without ever having to login via a desktop cash transfers chase quickpay mobile deposits you name it i can even easily view canceled checks and monthly statements without hurting my eyes,1i use this app to do virtually all of my banking from paying bills to checking my balance and recent account activities from transferring between my accounts to making deposits  i love the freedom it gives me to do all of my banking anywhere anytime and to keep on top of any account needs i highly recommend it,1this is a very convenient app and when i rely on every day however there is room for improvement depositing checks could be better streamlined it should not take so many clicks to get through the process managing payments is awkward why should you need to enter your password at most you should be able to validate with the fingerprint feature,1depositing a check from a friend or family member cant get any easier i just launch the chase app and take a picture of the checks front and back in seconds i get a confirming email telling me the money was deposited into my account sooooo much better than driving to the bank ,1prett much ive been having my account with chase for not so long but other then that i havent been having any fees or anything like that its pretty easy and simple to use i recommend this bank to most people who like to save thier money and dont like getting any fees college student account is the best cant go wrong with chase,1i moved to a state that does not have any brick and mortar chase banks until this app came along i had two checking accounts and was seriously considering leaving chase all together now i am back to just banking with chase because i can deposit all my checks through the app and my most common needs are serviceable here as well,1i really like how quick and easy it is to be able to use the app i can check my balances and pay my bills check my alerts and my statements as well as my activities this app really helps me a lot on the go convenient id say for anyone that doesnt desire to go to a computer and log in great app for the go,1has pretty much everything i need to manage my account i really dont see much room for improvement love the fact that i can take a pic of a check and deposit it without having to go to a branch only problem is that it takes a little longer to show up in my account but thats pretty minor,1in a world full of stress chase has once again combined convenience efficiency and care for the sake of the customer this blue and white wonder makes keeping track of my finances easy and runs more smoothly than the backside of a dolphin my money is so close to my fingertips that i forget im online thank you for the service chase banking thank you,0ive banked with chase for years and ive used the app since theyve launched it this most recent update crashes on my phone every single time i try to use the app ive uninstalled and reinstalled closed all working apps and ive tried logging in at least  times before i give up this is really unfortunate and inconvenient for me wanting to use the app the way it was intended and not being able to get past the login screen before it crashes please fix it local chase cant help because none of them write the coding,1use this app daily it has made banking virtually effortless access to my accounts  no matter where i am has been especially helpful making sure my daughter had enough  in her account while she was traveling also easy to monitor how much money she is spending and where,1i have a couple of chase credit cards and i have a tenant with chase bank accounts who uses quick pay to pay me the app has a simple yet effective interface and it is very fast to use fingerprint login is excellent the whole process of accepting a payment takes about  seconds,1easy to access navigate and read all info i really like the account balance appearing at the top of the screen and deposits clearly indicated by type amount and date with plenty of space to read everything clearly scrolling is quick and precise options are easy to see and select perfect,1this app rules its easy to manage and it has never failed on me i can do transfers and add accounts so that i pay my bills with a few swipes plus the security on it is phenomenal someone tried using my account once and i got a notification right away phone call and email my account was cancelled within minutes,1i enjoy the app lately tho my touchid has not been appearing when i want to log onto the app im having to manually enter my password which slows me down other than that its very convenient stable and reliable with the apple  touch id feature added for log in it just got simpler and faster when it works  one can do just about all of their needs from this app,1the app is very convenient with many useful features and works consistently with every software upgrade so far keeps me informed about my accounts with easy access plus alerts and saves so much time nearly eliminating trips to the bank works so well cant imagine what id do without it,1ive had this app ever since i started using chase about  years ago and i absolutely love it i like that i can transfer money from accounts instantly and they make viewing my account very easy ive used other banks mobile apps and hated them because of glitches but ive never had a problem with chases app love it,1this is a leader for the mobile banking app users the ability to deposit checks see copies of cancelled checks go back at least  years for bank statements and the addition of touch id make this one of if not  the best out there for mobile banking thank you chase it job well done,1i find this app very easy to use i check my charges weekly to ensure my charges are accurate ive spotted more than one unauthorized charge which is unfortunate but has saved me from bigger headaches down the road if i waited for the paper statement i can also redeem my rewards very quickly and easily using this app,1i had to take like a hundred pictures this morning to deposit my check no matter how still i was it kept coming out blurry bank of america mobile deposit catches the check right away every time and automatically too wish chase had this same feature,1i just read how the deposit feature never works  they take a perfect picture of a check and its rejected  ive used it x and it has worked perfectly the first time every time  this app is great for people on the go  great alerts to know if my card has been used  no complaints ,1i believe chase has set the standard and they have set the bar very high i cant think of anything else i would even consider trying to do with the bank app that i cannot accomplish quickly and easily with the chase application i would bank with chase just to have what i can do on my phone with this app,1i use this app often its a very clean and easy to use display i appreciate the email notifications i receive when changes are made to my account whether they are login attempts or payments this helps secure my account information i use the app much more frequently than the online website,1i have downloaded this app quickly after i opened my chase account its efficient and secure there are two features i enjoy a preview of my account before i log in its an optional feature fingerprint to log inapplause the application development team for being so hardworking,1i use this app to monitor and pay my loan  overall the app is efficient and easy to use  there are however a couple key features missing  one for instance is the ability to view  modify  cancel a payment that you have scheduled for a future date  while you can set a future payment once its done thats that,1ive never had a problem with this app and have found it to be very good the information provided is perfectly sufficient and presented in a clear and pleasing mannerone annoying aspect concerns alerts if there are alerts there should be a more direct way to view them ie when i tap alerts take me straight to them,1for me who has had an account for the past  years this app is really easy to navigate i rarely come across problems but with updates you expect some sort of problem in an earlier version it would randomly kick you off but i havent had that happen in a long time,0i gotta say chase mobile bank app was one of my favorites until the last update before you could just press on the account you wanted and you could see the latest no matter how old and how long ago you used the card activities now you have to go a whole  degree to get all that on the screen who had the idea to change that fire him please bring that option back please and then you guys deserve your  stars,1does everything i expect an app to do ive not had any problems with check deposit and the features are fine for a mobile app why would i want to do more than check balances deposit money transfer money or pay bills  i dont want to reorder checks or change my address,1not having direct access to walk into the bank do to our last move this is a great way to continue to manage my accounts  the app is easy to use and provides a convenient way to review transactions payments and track purchases  sure makes my life easier,1this application is amazing it is very convenient and easy to use it offers all of the features that the website does which makes it easy to manage your account on the go i highly recommend it to anyone who banks with chase i would like to thank chase for providing  the service they do,1i dont have regular bank account with chase to critic this app usability  however it is very useful for my k account  i can access it to check balances and some other transactions through this app  it is convenient and working most of the time  what i like to see in this app is the ability to setup a trade transaction so i dont have to use a computer for trade transactions,1this app is user friendly easy to navigate and always working ive had it for prob  years and its never crashed or stopped working i dont bank with chase but i have one credit card with their bank i use app to pay it and it makes life simple,1i absolutely could not live without this app i love that i can transfer funds on my phone instantly and also as i have to do is put my finger on the phone instead of logging in with the password every time ive never had any issues with this app and i recommend it to everyone,1this app is great  ive used apps from other banks but this one from chase is simply the best  the ui is beautiful  there are many functionalities  you can set up very specific notifications  they have preview which i find very useful just today they add touch id so you dont need to enter long password anymore the app runs smoothly and is stable,1would like to see the ability to drill down on a credit card transaction once its posted to the level of triggering a possible fraudulent charge submission so chase can call to verify validity of the charge  would also like to extract that transaction info and export to a message or pdf other than that i thinks its a great app,1ive been a chase credit card customer forever and this app is just another reason why this app is super easy to navigate always up to date and extremely convenient i would highly recommend downloading this to anyone thank you chase for such an easy to use tool,1i dont get why people complain about mobile apps that dont do everything that you can do on the full site this app works great for all the basic stuff i figure if you really need the alerts to have a zillion bells and whistles that the problem isnt in the app its in your financesthanks chase for making a great mobile app,1i like the app as it is convenient and easy to use however id like to see my visa payment get posted just as fast as it deducts from my checking account i easily transfer the payment from my checking to my credit card and it deducts immediately but it takes sometimes two days to post to my credit card not sure why,1i have limited knowledge of other banking apps so i cant compare them to thisfor me this app works well for what i use it for mainly depositing checks i have had few glitches in the past and those have been apparently correcteddepositing checks is a snap and saves auto fuel making trips to the bank,1easy to use great updates are made often have not had one issue within the appyou can set your alerts to remind you update you or make you aware of just about any activity i travel often is cool to see the background update to a cool site near your location ie downtown dallas or baltimore when youre in the city,1i would like to see the total balance after each specific expense on the credit card accounts also it would be nice to see the total reward points for each expense as well just like the website but overall i guess its not so bad i think the bank of america app is wayyyy better someone from chase should go into the bank of america app to take a look at all the things they should copy,1we lived for awhile in a state with very few chase banks and none close by so the only way to deposit paychecks with certainty that theyd arrive at the bank was via my phone thankfully the upper limits were raised i love having a teller available when i need one but for routine tasks like a deposit i dont even need to leave home now,1i love this app im able to check my acct at any time night or day amp i can even swipe the app page to the right amp get a quick view of my balance without opening the entire page that helps so that no one can see my password in a crowded store this just adds to my list of growing things that i love about yall already,0this update as of december  does not work its back to the same issue of not reading check something bad with this update please fix it was a  star app but now back to a  starthis app is very easy to use for making transfers check deposits as well as sending money the only issues i have sometime are checks from others banks but over time they have made it easier by updating banks that do not have all of the information in the same area so now i think i have only one bank i have a hard time with their checks,1i have several bank accounts at different institutions and chases mobile app far exceeds all of them a wide category of alerts keeps me informed of the status of my account the best feature is being able to swipe to the right and get instant account balances without logging in love it,1the app is very easy to use plus the balance preview is very helpful plus l would like to add i love the auto text you get the moment your account goes under the preset balance you set i love that speed of it by the time you get back to you vehicle or pull out the drive way the text hits you cell pure genius bank of america never did that,1i havent had any problems recently but a few months ago i did check my account transactions and thought some bills i had paid didnt show up  later when i asked a chase office about it they said they didnt know what had happened but would look into it   a few days later i believe the missing transactions showed up,1i use both this app and the bank of america app and this app has features that are easier to use and access although i dont utilize this app as extensively as others do it works perfectly for checking my balances and paying my credit card each month im happy with the ui and overall satisfied with what the chase app offers,1i use this app a few times a week with quick look at my account deposit checks and transfer funds to to college kid   chase app is simple to use  i like the setting with touchid quick view if my balance and receive notifications if and when i want  it works as advertised,1there is nothing you cant say as to how much i love banking on line with chase you can do so much and dont have to leave your home the only thing is cant withdraw money i get my balances anytime i just love it i also like the transfer money feature i have been with chase for a long time and havent had any problems,1i love it i love always being able to swipe and see my account fingerprint unlock it transfer money to multiple accounts deposit my checks and more ive never had a problem with this app since it came out it makes life so convenient everything is just a click away,1this app is amazing simple amazing i love the security touch pad login the over simplified payment systemi guess one thing i would recommend would be the rewards guide as well as option to be included within the phone app and nothing online not have it opened in safari keep up the good work chase i am counting on you,1it helps you a lot  if you have this bank  it will help out big time if you have the credit card it also helps you  and its easy to pay your bills  and its really good then someone tries to hack your account they freeze your account so no one can take the money out thanks chase you are the best,1this version is so much better from what i have seen so far i needed to be able to see individual card use and balances and now i can i love the notification each time one of my cards is used my phone dings and shows which card how much and to whom that part isnt new but is still great,1i use the mobile app all the time for bill pay and money transfers work smooth and i havent had any problems with it it has everything i need including adding a payee to pay bills other accounts to transfer money into and alerts for whatever settings your choose,1if youre like me amp constantly check  your balance this is the app for you i especially like that reviewing my balance to see if i have enough money for quick or unexpected purchases is right at my fingertips if youre an on the go kinda person this is perfect for you i strongly encourage you to download it now,1its super easy to navigate around and deposit checks without having to go to actual bank which is one of my one faults when i got checks but now resolved and i can view every thing i bought since i got my account so i can view the prices of certain bought items,1what a joy to just use your fingerprint reader to log onto this app very functional and intuitive design i do wish i had the ability to deposit more than  per day via this app particularly since i have been a chase customer since  still i recommend this app without reservation,0i have other credit card apps that are more convenient to pay bills see my balance and track incentives i dont like how i cannot see my airline miles in the app and i had to call chase to set up bill pay calling chase is like navigating an electronic maze of options and you can spend  minutes pressing buttons and end up in a menu that doesnt even serve the function you need then you have to hang up and start all over again,0if i mistype a letter on my password once it errors out and says too many login attempts ive had to rererererererecreate a log in password more times than i can remember and then when the touch feature fails it starts the process over again and i have deleted then redownloaded with similar issues i expect more from one of the larger financial institutions in the country and this is not allowing me to do my business efficiently or timely  stars when it works  when i cant even log in,1i love the new finger print your login makes things so much easier i love doing my banking through this app  the quick deposit has made it so easier for me to get money into my account i prefer it over making a car trip to the banksometimes it can get confusing on where to navigate to find certain things but i think ive gotten more used to it,1fast way to deposit to connect business for both sides making cash flew so easily build up credit for both sides no worry about paying back payment for doing business no excuse for late delivery mail and missing mail getting payment so easily,1 rounded up i use five other banking apps and for what i do the chase app is clearly the best i liked the suggestion for being able to reorder accounts it would also be nice to see my payees in the groups i set up in the full client is there a way to simply acknowledge an alert and clear it without signing into the app,1every time a charge or a credit  effects the balance of my account im notified within seconds as for my monthly bills it literally takes less than a minute to pay all seven of my financial obligations ive been using this app for approximately one year without a single error great job chase,0this app is so underdeveloped on the account summary page you get no info except balance and recent transactions on other banking apps like wf and boa you can see due dates min payment due how each transaction changes your account balance how much more you have available before you reach your limits etc this is a horrible app for how big chase is would like to convert all accounts to chase but will never do it until their online banking and app are actually of use i dont get how they can think this app is acceptable,1you can deposit your checks remotely by taking pictures of them you can transfer money between accounts pay your credit card even transfer to and receive money from other chase account holders saves me so much time running to the bank,1i only use this app for paying credit cards and its very handy and useful it is a little confusing to use when i get an email from chase advising that a payment is due and i have already scheduled a payment very recent payments are not shown as clearly as i would like,1i use mint  something happened and mint and chase stopped working together  now i need to change my password i am remote and have to change my password on my iphone because the bill is due  no access to a computer  the iphone app user interface is excruciatingly painful when trying to figure out how to simply change your password  no visually unique fields for typing in just a white background with the word password,0the app is fine for transferring funds and checking balances no problem but the constant problem of telling me ive tried logging in too many times and locking me out when ive not even logged in recently is extremely annoying forcing me to take time out of my day to reset the password for the th time already this year is ridiculous fix this immediately im tired of creating new password variations of the same password,1able to access all information clearly in one screen a must if one has a chase account love it very easy to navigate enjoy the fact that the web updates are customer friends and that the updates happen in the middle of the night a+++++,1the app has a tendency to ask for a fingerprint scan then give you notifications that override the scan feature it would be nice to have a scan button that activates the fingerprint scan option navigating between account and rewards is clunky its like you are in two different apps at the same time if it was all integrated with one look it would be better,1edited to add another star for supporting touch id its not a bad app but it could use a little more polish on mobile check deposits specifically it should support using the physical volume buttons to take a picture like the camera app does i also dont need to be told every time to take a picture of the back of the check and have to tap the button to continue,1now with the fingerprint login it is so much easier to use this app and i love the fact that i can deposit checks from my phone and theyre available pretty much right away i also use this all the time to transfer money to my kids in their high school accounts,1i have been using chase mobile app for the past few years and i have been very pleased with how well it works ive never had a problem with this app or the bank im easily able to check my accounts deposit checks quickly and make transfers when needed,1great app to stay on top of everything information is always current to the minute just now checked to make sure charge last night was done correctly much quicker than having to wait for my computer to boot up ive revised my review to say i dont like all the ads in my face distracting,1for whatever reason chase has decided to leverage technology to grow its account base and they have done a great job  the app just works and while some may wish for more bells and whistles i think chase has done a nice job of creating a highlyfunctional app while simultaneously making it simple and elegant,1this chase app is very easy to use and follow it displays all the information you need right away and its fast and easy to submit a payment this is the first time i used an app like this because its the first time ive owned a credit card so its made the experience a lot less nerve racking and easy going,1ive banked with other large banks and this app is easy to use and this one works as stated i like the feature of depositing checks as im  miles from the closest chase bank when your deposit is accepted you receive a notification easy peesey i pay bill in a snap and can move on with my day best banking app ive ever used,1overall the ios app for chase has provided a semiconsistent positive user experience however my one callout currently is the my users ability to pay bills through the app was missing replaced with transfer money i only rectified this by deleting the app and redownloading it i have no idea how the feature got removed but its disappearance left quite a few minutes of anxiety,1ive used this chase app for quite some time never an issue fingerprint login works great immediate results and feedback would highly recommendupdateas others have stated touch id seems to randomly turn off causing me to go find my pw book  to login updates since last review have been fine,0you guys really need the app to maintain my fingerprint settings its beyond aggravating recently that it seems if i do not use my fingerprint every other day its expires then i have to remember my password which im changing so frequently because i forget it and have to constantly reset it which doesnt work in the app so i have to login to my computer to do its so annoying im seriously considering dumping both chase cc and going exclusively with boa their stuff always works perfectly,1like everything about the app except depositing checks wont read the correct account numbers on checks after taking several photos very frustrating since i have a business would like be able correct account numbers on checks when read incorrectly  on photos instead of making trips to the bank please try to make this easier     gilda,1ive had this app for quite some time and love it i especially like the convenience of depositing checks by taking photos of them nice there always seems to be an issue with depositing green ones though for example government issued bonus or overtime checks quick pay option couldnt be easier,1so easy and convenient hardly a need to go to the bank anymore   having my account information at my fingertips is so reassuring and depositing checks through my phone is my favorite part  ive never had to problem with one check and ive deposited many i highly recommend this app,1this is a great app for chase user and want to have mobile banking on the go ive paid my bills using this app and check transactions and deposits using it ive even transferred money between accounts its easy to use ive had no problems with it all it does what i need when im on the go convenient,1i cant believe you can deposit checks straight from your phone i installed this app a couple of days ago and its already saved me two trips to the atm sweeti also like the way transaction information is displayed i actually prefer it to the layout on the chase websitemy only complaint is that the wavy line pattern in the background makes some of the text harder to read,0overall the app is just ok but could be a lot better there are way too many steps to take in order to dismiss the notifications also i dont seem to be able to see more details about each transaction kind of weird to separate out the deposits and debits and makes it weird to track your sequential events on the account i do like the colors and layout of the app just not thrilled with the features and usability of the app but im a new chase customer whose only had two days with the app so anything is possible,0until the most recent update i used this app dailyweekly to manage my accounts with chase since the update it basically lets me see a balance and thats it can not pay bills once an amount to pay is entered it eventually reverts back to all zeros and the numerical pad will not leave the screen i cant believe it has been a couple weeks like this and has not been fixed asap if it gets an update to work like it has before then it will be a  star app again until then it really doesnt even deserve  star,1i havent had any issue with chase app it is not full function like chase website but it is very helpful its purpose is to show your credit balance transaction history atm locations pay bill and pay credit which are the most common used functions what do you want other than that,1this app is fast and easy with a beautiful and fast interface does matter it doesnt work with wifi some but i use the app when im away from the house so i normally dont have access to wifi fast sharp looking can deposit checks up to the minute accuracy on debits and deposits and easy to navigate whats not to like,1i like the update but it still doesnt allow you to transfer money tofrom external accounts my other banking apps let me so i end up using them more im on the go a lot and dont have access to a computer all of the time so it would be much easier if i could just transfer money from my phone also using a pin to open the app would be nice instead of entering your password every time,1i can do anything i need to with this app i dont go to the bank anymore because there is no need im moving to north carolina next month where there are no chase branches and im not switching banks because i can do anything i need to with the app its also very user friendly and never has any glitches highly recommend,1makes my life one little bit easier and ill take every single bit i can get full time nanny to a  month old gives me little time to check on everyday items and this app cuts out two steps  may not be a lot to some folks but ask any of the hardest working people aroundmothers grandmothers and caregivers,1convenient way to manage checking accounts for college age kids alerts are handy for knowing whats up and transfers are quick only issue i have is that the check deposit camera feature requires too much fiddling on the iphone s using the guides is useless because the photo usually gets cropped,1love the convenience deposit a check with your iphone is awesome sendreceive cash transfer amp even wire money all at your fingertips the only thing that i dislike is the alerts do not take you directly to the specific account that the alert is meant for it is difficult if you have credit cards amp accounts that you are a signer onthats the only thing id improve on,1chase is always on the cutting edge of technology so no complaints about the apps functionality  i am confused by the decision to highlight the city photos as a key update when theyre as weak as they are  pretty sure that park they chose for my city isnt actually in my city  were not new york chicago or los angeles but we have a skyline  chase  if youre interested ill send you a picture for cheap,1i have multiple accounts with chase across several functions and enjoy that i can see the status of each at a glance i can always get more information by drilling down and find that depositing a check with the app is just as convenient as hitting up the atm if not moreso its clear and concise and does its job,1i have been using this app since it launched and it is so easy to use and has great functions which makes it so much better than going to the bank i love being able to deposit my checks and pay my bills within one sitting would highly recommend,1i use this app daily and it serves my needs well i can do any banking i care to do check balance transfer money pay bills and even make deposits cash deposit and withdraws would be a great added feature hai do get an occasional issue where it wont connect and i have to close the app then it works when i try again,1to say that this is perhaps the best banking app is more of a commentary on the state of the mobile banking industry than genuine praise the update is reasonably attractive but doesnt provide any read substantive feature enhancements such as fixing the many alerts or providing greater detail thats needed at the transaction detail level achieving greater parity with the online web offering would have been a more useful and welcome priority than the visual refresh,1this app is extremely beneficial and convenient for me and for anyone who wants to keep track of their account balance and review any spendings deposits and withdrawals it even allows you to deposit a check right from your phonethe check may take  days to show up in your account great app thanks chase,0customer for several years however i am very frustrated that while on my iphone there is no full site option to access statements and cash in my rewards balance i would really appreciate the online mobile banking and app to both have full site access without immediately defaulting to just mobile at the minimum i should be able to access my recent statements to see how much interest ive accrued  or the balance due especially my blueprint payments,1i love the fact that i can do my banking from this app i use it to pay my bills every month and transferring money is a snap i also love the photo of my city when i open the app that was a very good idea chase has been ahead of the game for awhile my son has b of a and he was only recently able to use the app for bill paying,1i have tried to download this ap a min of  times ive called and talked to thier it people all i got was a large  as a ticket  a week later i still cannot use the ap to do my banking good work chase oh yes i have  on my phone you guys dont have to worry about hackers or maybe you do cause they are the only ones who can get in,0so im pretty annoyed that chase is forcing you to update the app i have an older iphone and used the chase app every single day multiple times a day if for nothing more but to check my balance now that the app requires an os my phone cant achieve i can never use the app on this phone that blows it says i cant download the latest update but can download one capable with my phone yet when i do that it says i need to download the latest update to use the appand so the cycle begins chase and apple are clearly making certain phones and users obsolete,1the much needed improvements in this version over the old one are very good a few more suggestions the capability to search by payee name  ive been asking for that feature for  years and they still dont have it online or in the app chasemy old bank had that  years ago the new design is welcomed but still needs to have the search by payee name feature,1i love this app its so easy to use and very convenient from finding atms to ease of checking how much fake made up money i have and dont have to determining my selfworth according to societal standards that depend on how much of it ive got as well i think my favorite part is the background changing depending on what city youre in i do love it in all seriousness though ,1i use it every day in the days of widespread fraud i like being able to keep an eye on all my accounts the notifications are very timely the ease if navigation makes it very time efficienti have been using it for as long as its been available every update improves on the previous version,1use the app on both iphone and ipad almost daily for balances also less often for transfers bill pay quick pay and deposits for on the spot situations its terrific convenient and easy to use not perfect notification issues less transaction info as noted in other reviews but close enough to be very useful and convenient very glad to have it,1this app works well for the most part i love the swipe right option to check balance snd the new touch signin is really awesome i never wanted to save my login in case something happened to my phone so this saves time for sure only complaint is the secure messages never load but it will show you have one,1great app all around from the ui and intuitive workflow this app takes any worry out of navigating through your personal records sometimes viewing alerts can be a bit glitchy but overall a great app its nice to see that our money isnt just being used as a fat bonus for the ceos job well done to the designers and software team,1love the app it provides great features such as account preview touch sign in and gives you the ability to pull up statements chase is always adding great new features to help make banking easier wish i could make more than one payment to my credit card in a day use this app daily,1basically happy with the app one thing they could improve is having the ability to view your statement if a new statement drops you cant see any transactions that took place before the bill date since the date was yesterday i cant view any transactions unless i log in from a computer since i have paperless billing thats the only option to see them,0recently this app has been a pain the touch id is not working properly asks me to put my password then change the setting to select touch id i have done that  times today when you select to text you a passcode because for whatever reason its not recognizing my device which i have been using for the past year i do not get the text so i have to go back enter my password again and select email passcode please fix it it was working perfect before,1i just love everything about chase mobile appthey are the example i show to any other bank i always ask if they have a mobile app with similar features or dont even bother getting my accountthe apple pay implementation and fingerprint id login is a bliss for a constant intraffic person like me,1i love the convenience of having all of my bank information at the simple touch of a button i specially like the deposit feature it saves me trips to the bank i get to choose alerts for when i receive my direct deposit when i have a withdrawal greater than xx when my deposits get accepted etc,1no hassle the app always reminds me if i forget payment is coming up customer service is amazing  and has never failed me i love my chase slate card never letting this one go i wont bank with chase but hands down their customer service and representatives are great with their credit cards,1i bank with chase because im a winner i want the best and chase delivers every time everything is done quickly and customer service is great fees are minimal and most of the time you can get them waived i love the mobile app honestly the app sets chase far above all others extremely convenient and up to date to the minute,1i use the chase app for all my needs it is user friendly and unlike other apps it is easy to navigate on my phone the only thing i use my computer for is to shop using my rewards definitely worth using to manage your account make payments and view activity,1geez where was this level of convenience  years ago  ive been able to accomplish all of my daily banking needs with this appparticularly when im traveling  has worked flawlessly for me so far  this is a welldeveloped app that gets better with each update  i recommend it highly,1i am disabled am mostly confined to my home i love the fact that i can take care of almost all my banking needs without ever leaving the house they make it easy to track all the information needed to keep track up to the minute the status of payments its always right at my fingertips and best of all its sooo easy to navigate,1i love this app it keeps me up to date without fail i also love the preview feature so that i dont even have to log in to see how much i have in my bank account its easy to deposit checks on here make transfers and call for help with all the numbers listed for you at your disposal love it,1this app finally consistently works and is easy to use since the update to touchid i appreciate the ability to peek at my account balances without signing in but since touchid was added signing in to get all features takes literally what about  second longer now the app is functional and does what i need generally couldnt be happier,1great addition to the local to youre in however youre subject to the whims of the local wifi and location its a good app over all seems to update quite a bit which could be viewed as both a good and bad thing  i would like to see the images change according to the seasons  and if there is not a chase bank around its the standard blue ,1thank u for giving me a chance when no one else would thanks to you in the past  months i have  in credit from other sources as well chase opened that door for me  for emergencies only of course i have improved my credit from  to  in those  months thanks to chase bankgrateful,1the app provides a full suite of features so that virtually the only thing i go to a branch for these days is cash but better than that unlike many apps that provide a lot of functionality its reliable i never have to wonder if my information or transactions are complete and accurate,1i use this app all the time and its very convenient for depositing checks and quickly saying my balance and canceling bill payments if i need to its great to be able to do most things so that i dont have to get on the computer all the time i hope they continue to improve it and give me something i didnt know i needed,1the best bank period the alerts are the best and they are great with catching people using your card which is great cause you can do it all through text and they send you a new right away when that happens plus refund the money which is great i do everything on my app or through text with chase woohoo,1great app makes it easy to deposit checks and use chase quickpay  it may seem silly but i really like the background image at the login screen too its fun because it is local and changes the app makes mobile banking so easy it is nice to quickly be able to check my balance or review a recent transaction,1i love chase the bank locations love the app love the convenience of having my bank in the palm of my hand all the time i use quickpay weekly transfer funds all the time balance the cash flow in my fantasy football leagues own account everything chase get  stars and two very enthusiastic thumbs up ,1the interface is a little confusing and it doesnt allow you to do some of the things that can be done on chases website it also makes you enter your password just to pay your bill even after youve already logged in i get that its just extra security but it would be nice if touch id were applied to that too so it would be quicker and easier,1for customers with multiple accounts the view alerts feature is lame it seems to be forever stuck in  where the rest of the app helps establish the standard for vintage ios apps chases attention to detail on the web site and here caused me to shift my banking from wells fargo,1this app functions fine but the app for my credit union is better which i wouldnt expect because chase is a way larger company its annoying that i can use touch id to log in to the app but to make a payment i still have to enter my pw also if i have timed out i have to close and reopen the app to use touch id to log in again my credit union app has a spot on the log in screen to initiate the touch id login,1i like my choice with this app preview balances or not  apple pay or not  touch id or not the only real down side is the credit card that shows as listed account has to be signed in separately in order to check balances or interest rates the only thing it allows is making a payment and  you still need to reenter your password to do that as well,1i love the app its easy to log in even if i can remember my password it lets you use your fingerprint to log in that is awesome i love the easiness of finding what your balance is and all transactions listed at the bottom the functions on the left side are a total bonus too makes my finance journey comfortable thank you chase,1this app is so easy to use and so convenient i dont always want to go to the bank just to deposit a check so i use the app and its done in minutes and i love being able to monitor my account and get notifications based on amounts spent that i set myself great way to keep track of spending love this app,1weve had chase bank for our personal and business accounts for  years now they are always responsive and offer up help in any way they can when i call customer service i can easily understand their representatives thanks chase for the hard work and dedication to your customers,1my job only offers direct deposit if you use their credit union so this app is a godsend there have been a couple of times where the app couldnt read the check and i had to deposit the check manually but thats a small inconvenience compared to the massive convenience this app generally provides,1functional and user friendly however a little annoying that you can use fingerprint access to log in but you still have to input your password to pay your bill so if anything fingerprint access is more work if you want to make payments also you have to log on to your account on a desktop to add an account to make payments from convenient app but you can do better,1we have been completely happy with chase ever since we moved from the nightmare of boa i use the chase app frequently to stay on top of finances to pay bills and to move money its so easy and convenient to do what i need from the app its also great to see all accounts including retirementsmortgageautosavings in one place,1chase was for me the bar for how a mobile banking app should be done my second bank wells fargo was horrible in comparison though wells finally supports touch id its app still far behind chase the chase app of late reverts to having me type my passcode instead of using touch id i hate that i need the security and the speed threat touch id offers please fix until then really three and half stars,1this is an extremely helpful app i would recommend it to anybody with a chase account quick access to your accounts and also i love that you can easily transfer money to other chase accounts if you dont want to go to an atm phone or online get this app for convenience  right in the palm of your hand,1i appreciate that the developers of this app keep up with the changes in ios instead of getting stuck in the past like some other appsthe new version looks sleek and modern still my favorite feature is the ability to deposit checks right from my iphone so convenient,1ive become a touchid power user on my iphone i kept wondering why chase and other banks had been taking a while to roll out touchid for their apps then i thought about the security risks and now i understand i really like how you ask for my password before doing anything risky clever and kind of like itunes and apple handle it thanks for figuring out first,1i think there is a bug thoughif finger print scanner is enabled you can just keep trying logging in with finger after  times failures you will be prompted to log in use passcode of the phone  notice this is the passcode of the phone but not really password of your account if you know the passcode of the phone you can then log into someones bank account,1its so convenient and easy to use and being a iphone user the touch security features is a godsend i really like the balance peak option as well once again chase has fulfilled the true meaning of convenience and customer satisfaction switching my business to chase bank was the smartest thing ive done considering banking,1i am thoroughly satisfied with this app it does everything i need and more i am happy with the new sign on dont know if its the phone or the app but being able to login with a fingerprint is so simple and easy because for me i have long nails and sometimes it takes two maybe three chances to get my password correct,1it works exactly how a bank app should everything is super easy and in real time i can move money while standing at the register and its ready to spend the second i press submit on the app and i certainly dont miss going to the bank now that i deposit all checks through the app great app that i use every day,1this is the best bank app by far user friendly and easy to manage your balance deposits and transfers i love the quick pay option i bank with chase only and my mortgage is with this bank as well customer service is really good fraud alert is monitored in real time and alerts you immediately i love love this bank,1i like this app for the most part i liked it more when it had touch id after the most recent download i lost the functionality to use touch id on my iphone s other than that i highly recommend it it makes banking so much easier to have it at the touch of your fingers i especially like being able to deposit checks directly from my phone,1its quite annoying when youre unable to use the touchid function after you bypass the popup rate this app request when selected remind me later option the window disappears but your touchid does not popup for you to access your account instead it presents the login screen where you have to enter your password this defeats the purpose of utilizing touchid,1chase app works great use it daily only thing i would change is  add a section to look up checks ie i would love to have a section to type in the check number and it would instantly tell me if its been cleared or not otherwise i have to scroll through all the charges looking for the check that would make it that much more easy and convenient,1i love that i can do everything on the app that i can do on a desktop  i like being able to preview my balance without logging in and i can use touch id to login as well  being able to deposit checks and send other people money without a wire transfer fee is a great benefit as well best banking app ive ever used,1i dont understand the alert system well i love the app for paying bills and credit cards quickly its easier to use the app than online however the push alerts are not useful or helpful and i wish they were more specific than push alert epay and then not specific on what you paid and why i get three emails its redundant it would be nice if the balance showed pending payments,1a wonderful app that makes banking easy  until last week i hadnt written a check in three years paying bills is made simple and easy  i like being able to check balances and transactions frequently  quick pay is great signing in with touch is very convenient,1this app is very user friendly and i can check on all my chase accounts deposit checks move money between checking and savings keep an eye on all my accounts including credit card purchases its like having the bank open  hours a day anywhere i am,1awesome app i love that i have the ability to do most of my banking through this app i deposited a check through it the other day and it went through smoothly i have never had an issue using this app its the most important app on my phone and i am very happy that it works as close to perfect as possible,1i must say im very pleased with this app i can log in by touch to see charges with a typed password i can even see statements super convenient and easy to use lets me pay my bill while commuting without having to whip out my laptop and worry about others seeing my screen well done chase,1i am truly pleased with my chase mobile app it is very convenient and allows me to monitor my activity even when away from home i most enjoy the check deposit option that is available it allows me to deposit checks without having to drive up to the bank or an atm i am very happy,1does not ask for fingerprint all the time need to enter password a lot of times alert message needs to improve a lot from the notification if i click the alert it should take me to the alert message but it takes to account details most of the alert message does not contain complete information you hvae to look at account details to understand the full details,1the app is easy to use and very convenient for paying credit card bills no paper is wasted in the process and due to the text reminders no due date is missed the only improvement i can recommend is to enable a thumb print instead of password to access the account,1app is great i just dislike how sometimes it has been inaccurate with my funds i know partially cause it takes time for things to go through but still it just lags them at times some purchases that were made days before will come through as if they were made today but overall the app runs great never freezes or crashes,1i hardly ever write a review just had to say this is one of the best apps i have use it constantlylove that i do not have to log in a second time to do separate function wish i still had to accept quick pay deposits would like some kind of indication as to which account has an alert,1have never had trouble with this app always smooth sailing chase has always been a wonderful banking experience they always make me feel so welcome it feels like family and friends in the local branches i love all the features that are available to me on the phone computer and at the branch thanks chase,1i have not had any problems with this app at all  i use it everyday and i really like being able to see my checking amp savings balance on the same page as my credit card balance  it also makes it very easy to stay current with charges to my credit card,1the service is fast and versatile i have been using the mobile app for some time and have only been disappointed once this was due to internet glitches and slow updates sure this was annoying and inconvenient but the situation was quickly fixed and i have been satisfied with my service since then,1i find being able to manage my accounts and pay bills from my phone exceedingly helpful especially when i travel i have had few problems using the appmost of my own makingand would recommend it to all who bank with chase,1i have banked with many banks in the last  years chase by far has exceeded my expectations  i came to chase after bofa stole money from me and a local credit union would not take me they started my account in  and i have been with them ever since their mobile app is by far the best ive seen and i use it all of the time,1we have used the mobile app for several years chase makes finances easy we  always get current info  using app to deposit checks has made life easier for me minutes to nearest brick and mortar quick pay bill pay and transfer options are user friendly and efficient,1i love having this app on my phone for the updates and information it makes available at a fingers touch as well the accuracy it provides to help prevent fraudulent actions against ones account is immeasurable thank you for the reliable excellent service,1for the most part im very happy with using this app for my banking needs occasionally it takes longer than i think it should for a deposit to show up im comparing this to another bank that i use for online deposits definitely beats waiting until i have the time to go to the bank staff is always very friendly and professional,1the app is pretty good for my needs i only have a single cc account to manage with this app my big gripe i use finger print recognition to sign in but then for certain features it asks for my password the whole reason i use the finger scan is so that i dont have to remember all of my different passwords so if i forget i become locked out of important features which is partly why i would use the app,1i have a need to manage my parents accounts and sometimes transfer funds from my account to assist them or pay their bills from their online accountthe app makes it easy to do all these things on the flychase quickpay is also invaluable,1i hate going to the bank to deposit small checks this app is great from monitoring my acct and deposit checks without going to the bank my only complain is i cant check my routing number or account number even if i enter my password and transferring money is imposible if you have not enroll in their website,1the work being put into this app is nothing short of amazing  previously i had problems with touch id turning itself off every day thats now fixed check deposits are flawless and i am able to do more right from my phone than ever before,1i love my chase app it makes it easy to do almost everything i deal little in cash or have little time to go to the bank so the app makes it easy to send and receive money threw quick pay or contact customer service that i never have hold times for and manage all of my accounts plus more,1the chase app makes my life so much easier i use it to deposit checks pay bills make transfers and i love quick pay if i need to send money to someone in a hurry i can just quick pay them and its done no need to run to an atm to get cash and take it to them just go to my app wherever i am and its taken care of love my chase app,1i think the app is pretty good its simple and straightforward but what i really miss is the fingerprint password instead of entering a written password as long as passwords are now days and the number of passwords a person needs to know a fingerprint password is so much more convenient i have fingerprint password with both my wells fargo and my american express no reason not to have one with chase either,1i can pretty much do everything i need to do from the app without logging on from a computer no bugs no freezing just temporary maintanance from time to time which is understandable security upgrades to protect our accounts and privacy is nice and has to be improved every now and again,1i do almost all of my banking with my chase app  fortunately i have never had any problems with it there are so many things that i love about this app i love the quick view swipe to see my account balances transfers are quick and easy  bill pay is great also  i definitely recommend this app,1compared to my other banking apps this doesnt provide a lot of functionality  no ability to request credit limit increases etc without just redirecting you to the website  i actually decided to transfer credit card balances to a different bank because this app wasnt comprehensive and modern  good for checking balances and making payments but thats it,0i dont have a chase near me so the mobile app is my lifeline for my account i had a problem last year with fraud causing multiple overdrafts which were all reversed but now my mobile deposit is locked out after calling multiple times to customer service they have told me there is nothing they can do why would you deny someone the ability to deposit funds i could see if i had bounced checks from deposit or something but this is making me wish i had a different financial institution,1i love this app i can travel anywhere and at the top of my finger on my phone i can get all my accounts to look at and one glance i like how all my accounts are on the front page it is a very easy app to use i like being able to deposit a check if i cant get to the bank during the week very convenient,1i am a career banker and have been using this app to manage my personal credit card for the last few years it has never failed and has always been easy to navigate tracking purchases accessing reward points and making payments couldnt be much easier,1i have been using this app for a long time now it has been excellent overall i am able to do almost all of my banking from my phone which saves me lots of time and provides wonderful convenience tech support the few times that i needed has also been excellent if you bank with chase this app is a must have,1ive had this app for probably  years now it is so extremely quick and easy to use i can do everything i need to do from it such as quickpay deposit checks transfer funds or simply check my balance ive never experienced any glitches or problems with it love it,1i have been using the chase mobile app for years now  i am a person who loves stability  the problem is that every few months the folks at chase revise this app  unfortunately the last revision was the worst  it is awkward to use less user friendly and less informative than the previous versions  one has to wonder are these changes made to help us or are they for the banks benefit,1i love this app its easy to use and very handy to have i can transfer money from accounts right from my phone and chase quick pay is amazing i no longer need to run to the many chase atms in my area to pay back one of my friends for dinner overall a great app and highly suggest,0i am writing because i would like to keep the app on my phone i need it i have deleted it and downloaded it so many times i cant keep up anymore for  years i had had this app malfunction on my iphones with the chase app only it will work for a few times while i sign in using the touch id and then it will stop working and say the app is temporarily unavailable please try again later please give me an idea on what i can do to make the app work on my iphone  plus its very frustrating,1i use this app  times a day to keep track of my spending transfer money and check deposits it is accurate colorful and easy to use  i like that i can access all my banking services from my phone or laptop and the security features wish everything worked this well,1i use this app for checking and savings account only and it does its job perfectly well i can check balances and transactions transfer funds between accounts send funds to other chase users for now i recommend this app to chase banking users,1being able to check in on my bank account transfer money and even pay my credit card all through this app has really made my financial life so much easier its so easy to use everything loads quickly and it never crashes love it,1it is better than the old version but it still has room for improvement id prefer alerts would go to the account that actually has an alert instead of trying to figure out each time what account its for it also needs better password encryption but adding the iphone touch feature was helpful  there are a few other details that need improving keep working on it,0this app offer a look at the delusional idea the chase team has about consumers why would i click on the card tab to be offered to sign up for the card i already have i dont know why are there so many options to sign up for loans cards and other accounts but its nearly impossible to see my recent card transactions i have no clue this app is so frustrating ill be canceling my card probably because the app is very important to my experience as a user word of advice the amex app is excellent,1i dont use some of this apps features but it is convenient for checking balances making cc payments transferring money between chase accounts and transferring money to other chase customers with quick pay very seldom have any problems with it with regular use,1there is nothing wrong with the app it works you cant deposit checks if someone signs over the routing number i have been using chase for the past  years  the best bank dont listen to the idiots that try to deposit bounced checks or not clearly written checks ,1if it wasnt the human part i would rather use the app chase has figured out how to do banking app right because of how simple and effective the app is i actually moved all my money here and credit cards too i still bank with others but depend on chase to manage the bulk of my day to day needs,1chase has one of the best banking apps i use daily the apps from city boa capital one  wells fargo  ae and barclays and although all the above mentioned apps work great  chase is one of my favorites because i can practically do everything within the app there is always room for improvement with any app but for now chase seems to be just fine and perfect ,1this app has really been helpful in managing multiple accounts when away from home i havent had any issues with it this far it is always updated correctly and allows me to be more conscious of spending when on the go because it updates instantly,0over the last maybe two months i am having to change my password for my bank account just about every  days it has become insane i keep getting messages that it is from too many login attempts but im the only person who logs into this account i suggested that if i place my finger wrong to login that might count against me as a failed attempt but the  number and the bank say that is not likely im just about out of passwords guys,1its easy to use and it never crashes what more could you ask for plus love the ability to deposit a check and not have to go to the bank plus easy transfers theres nothing bad to say about this bank app i feel very secure using this sight love it i never have to ask how do i do this keep up the good work chase,1addendum to belowthe app was fixed by a total removal and phone restart and redownload i have to say it is a very simple userfriendly app welcome back chase mobile app previousthe last app update has cause this app to be completely useless i just cycle between the app which sends me for the update in the store all there is is the open button no update available i hit open and go back to the app where i am again redirected automatically to the store ive deleted and redownloaded the app both before and after restarting the phone this is a debacle used to love this app no more fix it please,1this is an amazing app very convenient how you can see your chase credit cards and pay them right from the app i have had no issues whatsoever with it its weird reading the other reviews that have trouble cause ive had no trouble at all been using it a long time and love it i highly recommended it,1this app is amazing i have no problems at all i dont know what other people are doing but the touch id is awesome you see everything without resetting your password theres nothing wrong with this app the only thing i wish it did if we were able to edit the description on your transaction,1love that now you can do anything on the ios version of the app with just a touch of your finger can do virtually everything as if you were at your computer and the account alerts really help you stay on top of your banking to prevent fraud chase is the gold standard when it comes to us banking + technology,1the app is great when its not crashing so its super easy to use when youre on the run i need to check your account real quick transferring money is also easy to use within the app mobile deposits are great but there is a limit other than that i would definitely recommend the app to anyone who has chase as their bank,1this makes being responsible with your money the easiest thing in the world quickly and easily transfer money and pay bills from your phone while never having to guess about your account balances i think this is the gold standard as far as banking apps go,1the app is good allows me to track all accounts only gripe i have is the notifications light up but clicking in them may or may not show the notifications it always shows the same account whether it has messages or not it should always show an account that has a notification in it,1but it has crashed halfway through making deposits and seems slower to show my deposits than before the update its been over  hours and i still have no confirmation that my checks have cleared nor have i had the first  instantly available,1i have used the app for years and its easy to transfer money between funds access and redeem credit card points and see statement balances as with all apps interface could always be better however it is pretty user friendly i would recommend using for every chase customer,1some people might complaint about not having the exact money on display but first of all you need to be aware of that some transaction take a little time to process so do not blame it on the bank or app is an awesome app quick and easy to use keep it up i use this app almost every day and i have zero complaints,1i love chases banking app truly i am picky about online banking and use everything mobile and i love it great amp free mobile deposit easy to set customizable alerts touch id login and now you can view check info though im disappointed with their atm and bank building access the mobile app makes up for it,1i must say the revamp of this app shows a great deal of thought went into it all the most important information is readily available on the front screen things i used to hunt for in the old app are right where i need them now the website and this app are now seamless compliments to each other,1its easy to use and allows for easy banking needs until after oct now it logs me out all the time the program will not keep my finger print log in i have went in almost everyday for  weeks now deactivating it and i get not available at this time non stop especially when i need it most not that it knows this but i need reliability i hope theres an update soon that fixes these issues,1i love using my chase mobile app it has more features its more efficient and designed better than wellsfargo citi amp barclays card app its definitely user friendly and looks much better than the rest of the bank apps its always one step ahead of its competitors i have no complaints on this side ,1this is a great app that keeps me up to date constantly with my account and informs me of everything i need to know i love choosing what notifications i receive and the only tiny thing that annoys me is when it says the chase system is down over all its a great app every chase customer should use,1this is such a great app ive never had a problem with it its easy to use you know your purchases and you choose when you want it to alert you when you have a low balance it works smoothly with direct deposit for work and its quick with updates awesome app absolutely love it,1app tells me i have a notification i get a screen list of my five chase products with no hint as to which one wants my attention the list is not sorted by date so i open each product notification history to see if thats the one that wanted my attention even when i find a recent unread item i cant tell if something further down the list also had something important to say,1ive have a lot of experience with banking apps chase has spent a lot of time in thought on how to perfect it and they have im extremely impressed with the amount of detail and accuracy for each transaction its definitely worth the download also the ultimate rewards design is very helpful and clear  stars,1updated review the deposit button is now displayed apparently the fact that i was a new chase customer with new accounts is the reason the deposit button did not initially display i got the accounts with chase on a saturday and now on monday afternoon the deposit button is displayed and functionaloverall this is a nice app the ui is clean and fast ive not had any stability issues,0this app will causes serious frustration if you are looking to use it mostly for deposits it only accepts an incredibly obtuse monthly limit of what seems to be around  and of course it never actually tells you what that limit is after that you get the generic popup youve reached your monthly limit after you have gone through the whole process the user experience is horrible in that you often have to try  or  times for a deposit to go through even with a  gs and a steady hand and if there is a problem there is no description as to what the problem is just there was a problem  definitely this app was made by a sadist w a wicked sense of humori can guarantee at some point even the calmest of us will want to toss their phones across the room,1i just recently switched to chase as a new customer  im glad i did for purpose of this app amp others  i especially love the deposit of a check from your iphone  saves me trips to the bank since i dont have one close to my houseonly suggestion  allow users to read secure emails from within the app,1im totally in love with this app no problem at all love the check deposit its a great features i have never had a problem with any crashing before the update was done overall chase is really a great bank and the mobile banking is perfectupdate since this review my sign in crash all the time never work please fix,0i have always been dependent amp thrilled with this app for our  personal accounts my business accounts amp credit cards  it hasnt worked since they updated it amp im considering moving all my accounts because i cannot do many things in the mobile version in my browser  how can such a huge bank have such terrible tech people  im not a developer amp would have had it figured out by now  im losing all faith in chase because with its resources i shouldnt have had more than one day before it was fixed,0i am it happy with the new update yesterday before i made this update all my balances were correct today none of my credit card payments are showing up so my available balances are all screwed up i thought my credit card payments were all suppose to show up immediately according to your update you are wrong also i dont like the new boxy look and all the colors added makes it look like a little kid drew all over my phone and made this update i like the old version better fix these issues,1its not a bad app and it does allow me to do many different services but the alerts could be improved if you have multiple accounts and you get an alert when you go to check it your list if accounts doesnt indicate which one had the alert also the alerts are not stamped with the date and time the alert came in so it can be difficult figuring out what alert you just received,0its annoying to have to dig around for the notifications but if you want the alert bubble to disappear you have to dig implement a pull down notification center on the main view so i can dismiss notifications without having to hunt also rethink your business rules around quick deposit if you overdraft an account shouldnt you be allowed to deposit money i would have thought youd put limitations in quick pay but instead you chose to make it impossible to give you money someone needs to rethink that one,1im not sure why this app has such low stars ive used it almost daily to check accounts wire transfer pay bills quick pay people etc its been so easy and a true lifesaver this app and all of chases online features is why i will continue to stay with them easy,1i have accounts with  big banks including chase their app is by far the best and provides almost every function that you can do at a chase atm quick deposit is a nice feature i also like the fact that chase themselves administer the application others contract out to third parties from what i understand,0i have always admired chase for their mastery of branding and thinking through the user experience but for me this mobile update is an epic failure its like they made your mobile banking into a blog the layout is confusing to the user the functionality is not intuitive and the bloggy feel cheapens the overall experience if this is chases reaction to edgy financial firms like simple thye have forgotten who they are i will be using the online platform instead of the mobile and if and when they change that maybe its time for a new bank,1i love being able to do my banking on my phone i was happy with the old version and still getting used to the upgrade i am always clicking on the wrong area when trying to see my transactions and just get a screen with the balance so that is the only thing that i would change,1very useful app lets you check to see whats going on with your account in detail everything from current balance to previous payment and lets you see your latest charges to your account the best part is being able to cash in your rewards right from the app thanks chase,1great app very clean interface and very convenient wish they did not do away with being able to see the debit and corresponding balance  columns that show the balance and the debit amount simultaneously unless i just havent found it with a few other issues correctedhopefully in an upcoming update this app would be even better,1the latest version was a nice improvement to the interface and its a great app overallbut i dont like that they took the running balance away  on the older versions you could see the balance history with all of your activity detail  this was helpful and i wish they would bring that back,1this is one of my most used apps the new interface is a little difficult to work with at first just a learning curb for me i was just so used to the previous version i would have to say the worst thing about the add is being depressed when i see how little i have in my account lol all in all it works well for my simple banking saving credit card and home mortgage needs,1i have been using this app while my kids were in college  they would call me and tell me they forgot they needed money right then and this app allows me to do transfer money between our accounts instantly  it has never not worked and it has always been accurate,1i dont have anything negative to say about the app its user friendly and easy to navigate i love it defiantly a great thing to have when your on the go or out of town it keeps us informed on our spending and its up to the minute updated so we have an accurate acct balance if you dont have this app get it,1this is a very well put together application it is easy to use and it is always helpful the only thing that might need improvement is the whole transferring a check into your account its a little difficult but after a few tries it goes through without a problem very well done,1love this app  have used it for a couple of years now  i have used apps from other banks that do not offer the great functionality security or efficiency that the chase app does  i find it very user friendly allowing me to get in and out quickly after responding to alerts paying bills or just checking accounts,1this is a really good app i use it when i go to school and just to keep track of how much money i spend i love that it logs you out when you turn off your phone or when you close the app to make sure that no body can get in it really helps when you need to transfer or deposit money this is a great app ,1being someone new to handling my money the app makes it so easy to view my account and transfer between checking and savings the quickpay is probably the best thing since sliced bread and beer the app has not only made me more aware of my money but reduced the amount of trips ive needed to make to the bank significantly i love it,1in general i love being able to take care of most my banking needs with an app having an app on my phone has saved me over and over again this iteration of the chase app is easy to read and navigate and i found it very intuitive to learn it also looks great which is plus plus for me,1i love my bank chase because of how convenient they make all your banking needs this app is easy to use and is a necessity for me while im going to college in a town that doesnt have a chase bank available i would definitely recommend this to all of my family and friends that bank with chase,1this app makes my life so much easier i always know exactly how much is in my account and have the ability to pay bills access statements and transfer money anywhere and with ease the check deposit feature is fabulous no more trips to the bank i recommend chase and this app to everyone,1with the app i can pay off my credit card so that is good but i cant find a way to view activity other than payments previously made i want to be able to check what activity has taken place with the account this is either missing or hidden either case its definitely a needed feature otherwise this would be  starts smooth interface and pleasing to the eye,1i dont believe ive ever had a problem with the chase app my only issue with it is that i have to type my password every time i want to log in i really wish i could just type in my  digit passcode like i do on the usaa app better yet id really appreciate having touch id integrated into the app much more convenient and securealso getting to the notification is not very simple and intuitive,0i use the quick check deposit feature in this app at least once to twice a week i do still have a s and i understand things look a little different but when you take a picture of the check the use and retake buttons dont work at all the only thing that happens is it zooms in on the picture being that i have two young children i cant run to the bank every other day to deposit checks so it would be really helpful if this can be taken care of promptly,0the app is slow and cumbersome which was tolerable until the function to deposit checks quit working entirely this is a huge problem because i recently moved and was mislead to believe that there were branches here when i opened my account upon arriving i learned that the nearest branch was two states awayi called support and they were polite and did everything they could but they just dont have the power or authority to do anything more than give me information and apologize for their companys incompetencegotta go find a new bank,0this has historically been one of my favorite financial institution apps but this latest update takes away some functionality now whether i click on the card  or the balance it takes me to the same screen clicking on the  used to take me to a separate screen with my total balance info and other details not sure why this change was made definitely a step in the wrong direction,1use it everyday loads fast clear and concise ui and shows all the important features you would want in a mobile app slightly related  any new account you create in chase automatically gets added i just got a mortgage and it showed up in this app i didnt have to add it or anything well built and a great app to use,1love this app love that you can slide over to see you balance without logging ini also love the touch id option i hate quick pay i wish there was a different way to transfer money using your account number instead of your email address and i wish you didnt have to accept the money it would be great if it was just automatically there,1this ap is perfect for me touch id makes it easy to go in and check stuff out  i can easily pay bills transfer money and see my balances this is the perfect bank iphone ap and i am super happy it does everything i want in a bank ap  works fast and has touch id what else could i want  ,1ive been using this app from its debut nothing negative to say i use it for all of my banking needs and it works perfectly every time love that i dont have to go into the branch to deal with lines and gaudy auto tellers the only thing i wish it could do is cash my check lol i deposit checks all the time but until these smart phones can materialize cash currency atms will do fine ,1this is a very handy intuitive sleek useful appit never crashes you can do all of your online banking deposit checks transfer money between accounts check account balances very easily and much more there are no distractions no ads just an easy to use application how they should be,1the app is great and is a time saver i agree with other reviewers that alerts need some work to make it easier to associate the alert to the account another suggestion i have is to allow is to forward confirmation of a transaction to our personal email or at least to our secure chase message in box,1love being able to deposit checks from my phone also like the new feature to just swipe the screen to see your balance without having to put in the password makes it nice when i quickly need to see how much i have before i make a purchase,1app is extremely easy and useful for checking all accounts and usage alerts are easy to change touch id is accurate and fast and the app overall makes mobile banking fast and useful i have a few other baking apps and chase seems to have the simplest and best looking layout,1i have had the app since my first smart phone it was my encouragement to change my mindset regarding my banking habits with one of the latest updates it now shows + alerts and i cant find any alerts set on any accounts this is the only issue i have ive turned off the push and that hasnt helped please advise,1i really like this app its very convenient and very easy to use  i switched to chase bank from td bank and chases app is so much easier  the balance of your account shows right away with no delays you can set up notifications to let you know that youve reached a certain point in ur acct to prevent you from over drafting   i love it,1i use this app mostly for quickpay and that service alone receives  stars i do wish the overdraft alert works better once had a payment taken out  pm went over by  amp the next morning i lack the ability to pay next bill because im in the red an extra  because the notification came after pm this has happened  least  times,1i have been using this app for years it got me through college as my main mode of transport was bike or bus a few miles to the bank couldve added such strain to my already busy schedule still living with limited transportation online banking is the answer to my needs thank you,1i dont normally write reviews but when i do i feel strongly about them chase is done an awesome job with this app it works exactly as you would expect it to and always works ive not had a single time where it has failed me even in poor coverage areas great job devs and keep up the great work,1love this app it makes keeping up with my credit card so easy i pay my bill from the app track charged and even keep a budget love chase and love their use of technology no more wasting paper sending statements or sending a check through the mail for payment,1i feel like a commercial whenever i mention using the app to my friends but its one of the most helpful apps i have on my phone i love the simple check deposit feature with a single picture the user experience and layout of the app is beautiful and intuitive i cant praise this app enough,1this app is the best hands down its so convenient so easy to use and no other bank beats it it gives you so many options whether you want to check your balances pay bills deposit checks amp you can even send money to someone who has another bank acct which is really cool amp innovative a+ to chase,1this app is very useful it allows me to check on my accounts anytime anywhere it has several useful features including transferring money wiring money and even personal payments this app is great and even gives you a few days notice if some features will be offline a must for any chase customer,1in the beginning i was a bit nervous about using this mobile app but as time went on it grew on me the new upgrades seem very cool and safe but only giving  stars until future review i say give it a try update enjoying this app very much its very convenient amp easy to navigate love the safety features amp the option you can use,0the online check deposit function is very inconsistent if the check is perfect and everything is typed in then there is no problem but for any check where the information is handwritten it only works about half of the time you can have to checks that look exactly the same but it will except one in reject the othereverything else works ok in the app but the check deposit is the function that i use most often,1i have an iphone s and us the fingerprint feature for security on the phone and the chase app quick and easy is the operative need and this app delivers i can move money from my business to my personal account at another banking company effortlessly i can do almost anything on the app as easily as i can at my desk chase gets it,1i enjoy being able to access my account at the tip of my fingers i think one of the best features is to swipe right and you have a quick preview of your account without  having to fully login great for on the go and of course the chase quickpay is another plus thank you chase,1i use this almost everyday to check my accounts and messages and to transfer funds  the recent improvements like easily allowing me to view checks make it practically perfect its clear welldesigned and so easy to use i have absolutely nothing to complain about,1only reason i give it  stars is because there is no easy way to quickly clear the notifications the entire app works flawlessly on ios however i do wish i didnt have to sign in navigate to the notifications and open it just to clear them since the notification is already in the banner updates,1really has my life a lot simpler since i started using it a few years ago its had many upgrades since then ive used almost every feature and had no problems its crashed maybe two or three times in the last two years but that was probably just my phone,1i have been banking with chase since high school and i love how helpful they are when something isnt right they fix it right away shut it down and contact you to get your account back on track the app is very easy to manage and everything is right there ready to go for you to use,1the best banking app by far easy to use constantly being updatedi have the same idea for improvement as many fix the alerts menu when you open the alerts menu it should list every account and the number of alerts on each account instead of having to go through every single one to find your alert,1my specific opinion may be based off of the fact i dont deal with the bank for much i do however get everything i need from a bank in this app since the closest chase bank is quite a drive away i am very pleased with the amount of ease this app provides good product gets a the kevin thumbs up of approval ,1ive been using the chase app for at least  years now it has been consistently easy to use from scheduling quick pay to son in college to setting alerts chase has continually improved it and i really like the ability to deposit a check via this app easy amp reliable,1i always had a very smooth experience with chase mobile one thing i would love to see is to be able to see details check images etc when you click on each transaction from your bank account similar to what they have for pc versiona very stable and smooth app otherwise ,1the others are correct the alerts arent perfect but they are customizable you can turn on and off certain things they doneed to make them easier to navigate but this app does what you would expect it to just fine never crashes and most tasks are very easy to navigate  stars ill give  when you improve the alerts user interface ,0some days when it decides to work i love the app makes it so convenient for me to deposit my checks then the other  of times when the app just gives me an error most days the app will just close out and make me sign back in other days i cannot get it to login its try again later that is what i have been experiencing for the past three weeksthe idea of this app is great but it really defeats the convenience factor if it never works,1while i love the convenience of online banking i hate that i was forced to open this app on my pad i like functionality of the app on my phone for quick balance checks and transfers but i loved the chase website on my pad because i could see everything like bill paying on one screen im no longer able to access that site on my pad and im forced to turn on my home pc to achieve what i used to easily do with my pad,1i love having banking right at my fingertips and the chase app does exactly that its perfect for busy lives that need an ability to do errands whenever you find the time the information is up to date and transferring from one account to the other is a breeze a seamless way for a great bank to add to themselves,1this app truly makes banking so easy and definitely convenient i can make transactions on the fly and transfer funds as i see fit whenever i need to i like to check my balance regularly to see what activity is going on so pulling out my phone and accessing the app is effortless very userfriendly,0the app is good but simple questions cant be answer on the app ie what is your acc routing number or just to know you acc  just from the get go yeah yeah some of you are going to say but how about security well dont you have to log in into your phone and dont you have to log in into the app to get your info  so there it is double security just to look at your accs an the quick view could be made with just the balance and no other info given for security  just saying,1with all its revisions the chase app is one of the best of the many many apps that i use and i use it frequently  pay bills credit cards deposit checks  virtually any banking function except being able to withdraw cash i suspect for obvious reasons it will never function as an atm but overall it is outstanding,1chase has been the best bank and app i could ask for i used have wachovia and wells fargo and i switched to chase and chase made the other banks look like fools perfect customer service and very mindful of their clients they even offer more to veterans like myself it is nice to be appreciated by my financial institution thank you so much for years of great service,1i have been a customer with chase for a number of years  the online banking app is great and i use it all the time  they have upgraded and made several modifications over the years that each one has improved the process along the way  this app is really the best now  i use it all the timesue,1ive been using this app for close to  years now and have experienced zero issues in using it it works great for balance checking transfers and check deposits if you have a chase account and are a smartphone user i would recommend trying this app to manage your account on the go,1typically chase does most things wrong due to its huge size chase makes employees do stupid things based upon their corporate rules  one size fits all  this app however is awesome this app makes banking from a phone soooooooo simple  the best part about the app is i dont have to talk to any chase employee who are probably good people but must follow stupid chase corporate rules,1i never have a problem with chase the people who work at the branches or the phones or even the online chats are always so polite and cheerful and always go out their way to please you i have gotten many emails and letters asking me to join other banks and i wouldnt even think of doing it i highly recommend chase,1love chase as a company amp love the app and ive never had a problem with the franchise side note it would be nice if chase would establish a franchise here in lubbock tx many college students here at the texas tech have chase but arent able to do withdrawals or deposits without paying extra atm fees at gas stations or local stores please look into this matter thanks loyal chase member,1this is a great app i like the instant updates my card got compromised a month ago and i was able to stop the transactions immediately because of the instant upgrades it gave me the only thing that needs to be improved is the finger touch log in looks like i have to try a couple of times before it asks me,1i love this app i am partially a invalid so it is difficult for me to run to the bank whenever i need to use my account with your apps i can do all of my banking at home and because it is chase i feel secure doing my banking on line thank you   please keep improving as you do and keep your security high i love chase bank,1all in all its definitely one of the best apps ive used never had it crash super simple seems secure pretty fast etc but the one issue ive had is the quickpay feature didnt work a few times not sure if thats the app or just chase network problems so i didnt knock it any stars,1makes banking simple and quick i very rarely even need to make a trip to my local branch because i can do the majority of my deposits through the app also makes it easy to transfer funds make payments and know what is happening in my accounts all the time so glad this is available,1i think the app is great the only time i have to go to the actual bank is if im ever withdrawing money from an atm the app allows you to check you activity balance make transfers pay your credit card deposit checks its great and i havent had an issue of it crashing on me yet either,0the chase app is good with making check deposits but finding the pending balance and transaction history take several steps and take days to reflect even corporatesource depositsthe difficulty with making a checking deposit at all happened when balance was low  paradoxical to not be able to enter money directly and instead to have to put it into another account and then transfer it to checking,1i find every part of the chase app to be easy to use for a quick account check when i dont want to go to my computer works well for multiple accounts and check deposits never gave me a problem its also a friendly good looking interface,0great app with a lot of functions that can save a trip to the bank or having to check on a computer however i usually have to try connect over and over again for it to work use it on multiple phones but each time i try to deposit a check i often end up reentering the information about  times before it works even with great functions it becomes useless if none of them will work properly,1from the start i was excited about using the app for remote banking its just so easy to deposit checks and transfer money even pay a bill on the run i forgot to make my car payment and when i realized it i made the payment with my phone and avoided being late its a lifesaver,1whats wrong with the app nothing its perfect gives me everything i need keeps me up to date and has kept me financially stable for the  years iv had the app never lets me down love the notifications of when i spend money when i deposit when i get money when im below a certain amount very helpful,1chases online banking is superior to any other online banking i have come across and their phone app is excellent as well my favorite feature is to be able to deposit checks quickly without having to go to the bank super easy to understand,1awesome i have used this mobil app for over  years my only problem is that some of the acceptdecline lines are too close and each area needs more space so you dont have the chance to hit the wrong button which i have done several times,1overall gives you balance and activity however it needs to have an update button refresh which it doesnt you have to relog to see the current balance for any changes  also the detail is not there some things arent posted like a returned item check wont show up but just the fee might ,1very easy to navigate and clients friendly especially for people who are not savvy with phones and computers for me is super easy to access and work thru the pages the color the design the accessibility and help is great as an application i have other banks in my phone but chase is the bank i used the most because i love it,1it works like its supposed to i miss the swipe function to get your balance without a password but i also understand the security issues with a function like that i guess its best that the function was removed overall a great app works better than the app i have from my credit union,1i have had this app for many yearslove it i have been a customer of chase for over  years have never had a problem that couldnt be resolved when problems arise we tend to get upset and want to switch banks nothing is greener on the other side and problems can always be fixeda loyal chase banker,1have used it for a long time and its really convenient to do simple thingssign in check balances make simple transactions not as user friendly when you want to do something with an external account like transfer in or out and could use work on checking historical transaction info,1i love this app i like being able to deposit checks without having to go to a brick and mortar bank the only thing that i dont love are the alerts the message will tell me that i have a certain amount in my account but the actual balance is always less i can just log in to check but its a bit annoying,1i love the chase app i use it to deposit checks and accept payments with quick pay i love how the quick pay section shows a little todo list for paying or accepting payments i think chase is far ahead of its big bank competitors in terms of using technology to make banking easier for its customers,1works well and is easy to use  one caveat is that you have that transfer funds  button right there easy to use but it doesnt warm you that you can only make about  transactions per month before you get a snotty letter from the bank threatening to close your savings and just stick the money in your checking thats why i only gave it four stars,1i love it but certain checks dont get excepted right away for some reason and i have to start over two three times or end up taking the check to the bank anyway otherwise its very convenient but as with most computer programs when you have a glitch its annoying,1this app has always performed flawlessly for all of my personal needs very efficient and user friendly excellent layout and easy to understand and read recommended even if your the slight bit skeptical jump you wonder why you waited so long to begin using the app,0every time i try to deposit a check it takes more than a handful of attempts for it to go through  full wifi full cell service with lte and i still always get a not working at the time try again later message  i truly hate this app with a passion and wish i had a bank with a working app  stars for at least letting me see my accounts  this goes for smallbusiness and personal accounts that i have  garbage all the way through,1well unlike many others that reviewed this app all i have is a credit card from chase i really enjoy using the app for my card it is easy to maneuver around keep up with my purchases and pay my bill on it i am giving it a  since it meets all the needs i have,1i have been a chase customer for years when the app showed up i was quick to install and start using it i gave the app a  rating and not  for the simple reason that i cant turn my iphone or ipad sideways to view the appthat said the app is intuitive easy to navigate and overall what i expectedall is good but can you fix that one small nuisance,1was already very happy with this app now they have instant deposit verification this is the best banking app ive ever used pncs mobile deposits are horriblealerts are great whenever we spend over  our threshold for an alert we get a notification almost the second our card is swiped how is that even possible,1at first i hesitated but now that i have it i cannot live without it in the pat it took weeks to know where your balance and purchases stood now its at the fingertips only thing i would like to see is specific details on product purchased such as   sound system   book robinson cruzoi still give it  stars,1i find this chase mobile application very straightforward and easytouse all id ask is a bit more ease in uploading my cell phone number for mobile text alerts which im having trouble authorizing from my devices nonetheless a relief to easily access my account information thank you,1great app unless you want to use it  have tried multiple times to deposit checks and always get temporarily unable to perform  so it is nice to look at but to actually get to use it is a hit or miss on any given day  but it is big business what do they care about my frustration,1picture check deposit preview balance without having to log in everything you need from a bank app only thing i think that would help this app is a chat with customer service feature almost every company has it why not a bank app,1i use this app almost every day check balances and pay my bills never have crashes or do i mind putting in my pw since i find it silly to have auto log to my financial info chase quick pay in seconds which is a revolution to me even trusted to sell my  car through quick pay,1this app has everything i need for business and paying bills im always busy and on the go so i like the fact that it automatically logs you out quickly when i forget to do soa little extra security there i have never had any problems with this app so i give two thumbs up,1never had a problem with this app until the update for ios  previously it showed my whole credit card bill history and now it only shows the history since the last statement including charges i still owe so to look at the complete history of charges i owe i have to login on my computer which is slightly frustrating fix this please,1i find the app easy to use and good functionality  really handy  the alerts are superannoying though  why it cannot just show the latest alerts is beyond me  it comes up into an account for which ive set none and tells me that  then i have to go hunting through accounts for the most recent alert date grrrr,1the chase app is for the most part extremely convenient it has become one of my most used apps  i am glad they cleaned up the amount of alerts and messages they send i am very happy with the app  i wish that if you check an alert on one device that it would show up on another,1this app allows you to do more than the app wells fargo has very userfriendly havent had any issues with it at all one of the main reasons i close my wells fargo account and move to chase their online banking and mobile banking is so much more convenient than others,1i really like the chase app and how it keeps on improving with more new features one thing i would love is if they brought back the feature where when you look at your credit card statementtransactions it shows the cumulative balance along with the transaction that will be very helpful other than that its an amazing app,1does everything i need it to do so easy to check a balance pay a bill or transfer money they now have updated and touch id works even better with it now in fact i take for granted how smoothly things work until i have to help a relative with their different bank banking app go chase,1i am able to deposit checks and transfer money whenever or wherever i am its so convient because i am always out and about i would rather be able to check my account whenever i want to then wait for my statement in the mail or go searching online,1i loved the details of every single even or things that i bought from the store and more and more everything have just showed up in my phone and those made a lot of more convenient for me thanks a lot chase mobile and especially thanks to administration and people who were create this app,0it displays credit card accounts that have been closed for years  banking is literally instantaneous but  days later ill get a text congratulations your payment has posted its extremely cumbersome to view purchases you cant categorize them you cant flag them for fraud or dispute  i can do those things with every other card i have  but im stuck because i have a united airlines card  open this app amp time travel to  tech,1great banking app used it for many years now and it is great deposits checks fine for me no crashing ever deposited several in the app with no problem this  month have never had a password problem fat fingers can easily type in wrong password this technology is flawless and complaints must be users fault,1i never used the quick deposit app while i lived in a location where chase offices were practically on every block now it is a  min round trip drive to a chase office the app is soooo convenient  absolutely love it  thank you chase for making banking so easy  quick pay is also wonderful,1we run our small business personal accounts vacation account joint household account all through the app  we take mostly personal checks for our income so the ability to deposit checks instantly with our phones is great very few issues simple interface and good flexibility we love it,1i like chase as my bank and the app is convenient but i do wish it was a little more user friendly the menu options on the sidebar arent intuitively clear and sometimes it feels like i dont know where to click to get what i want other than that i am glad to be able to use this app and i check my bank account more through here than using my laptop,1love the updated web page its very easy to navigate and has a nice personal touch on initial sign on page love the instant view feature i havent had any issues with it at all love the money transfer feature was a great way to send my son  while he was in college was an instantaneous transaction,1great app  however it has two very frustrating bugs i get proofed on my iphone almost every time i use the app what should be a quick transaction becomes annoying really quick  when paying a bill or transfering money the keyboard that pop ups has a comma no period so i cannot enter decimals it doesnt accept the comma in place of period,1the part that doesnt work is the bit of logic pertaining to user reviews i gave this app the below review months ago yet it keeps pestering me with review this app dialogs which are annoying________________i finally clicked on the little gray gt and learned it will show my abbreviated purchase history it just works im fine with it i just wish it would stop asking me for a review,1citibank allows me to make a payment once i touch id into the account this app does not if i want to make a payment i have to manually log in my id and password after i am already in my acccount really is someone else going to sneak in somehow be a secret donor and make payments to my account for meupdate moved to  stars for credit card accounts,1i use this app every month to pay my credit card bill it has replaced my computer as my means of dealing with chase ive never had any problems once i set it up ie linked it to my checking account it has been very easy to use highly recommended,1works great does what its supposed to do i like being able to see my balance on the start screen also using touch id fingerprint but the continual popup asking me to rate the app is really annoying plus after i x out of that it will not follow up w the touch id prompt so i restart the app and then can login waste of time and could be designed more efficiently otherwise good,1this app is a very efficient and simple way to manage my chase checking account  easy quick access through touch id view and edit bill pay  i use this one for my one utility bill that doesnt offer online payments or ach drafts  deposit checks from the app  quick turn around time  easy quick pay transactions,1this app makes paying bills and depositing checks very convenient just take pics front and back of checks and submit super easy i wish theyd increase to maximum deposit limits but im sure its a fraud deterrent if some sort keeps all the bills ive setup from their website accessible in my phone,1this app provides everything i need to maintain and monitor my accounts its not everyday that i consider and app perfect but this one is for sure its a small thing but having the ability to add to keep an eye on and move my money around at the click of a button is priceless thanks for the great customer service,1i have read several negative reviews concerning this app and i dont understand why anyone would complain about it i have used it for several years at least monthly and usually more often and i have never had the slightest problem it is first rate as far as i am concerned,1i have never had an issue using this app i check balances deposit checks transfer balances receive alerts and have never had a problem i have multiple accounts and have been using this app for years very happy with its functionality,1this app provides the info i need on all my accounts quickly and easily  i especially like updates on my investments the ability to deposit checks online and the ability to transfer money between my accounts  access with just a fingerprint is a bonus,1one of the main reasons i switched to chase bank was because of the great customer support and wonderful app i love chase bank and this app keep up the great work i would prefer to have an option to see the routing number and account number to my checking accounts within the app for convenience,1for everything that i use this app for i have never had a problem i have several accounts all displayed with organization i have no problem depositing checks via my phone i occasionally have to type in the routing number but thats no big deal chase quick pay is easy love it,1this is my favorite app of all my financial apps its easy to read and understand im able to access all my needed information the bonus is how easy it is on the eyes the modern fonts and the appropriate time of day greeting welcomes you along with the calendar date this app should be the standard for all banking apps,1the picture i took of the front and back of the check was perfectly clear i tried three times and all three times i got a message saying that it wasnt clear and i had to go to the bank to deposit it we just switched from a bank in ohio and i never had this happen before it totally defeats the purpose of having an app which is supposed to simplify your life ,1the only disappointment i had was when i got a new phone it took forever for the chase app to use my touch id to log in one of my favorite features super easy to pay all my bills and it automatically comes off my balance instead of waiting till they go through ,1checking your balance is on a very easy to read screen without a lot of nonsense to confuse you looking at statements online appears just as you would read it when it arrives in the mail the only downside is you should be able to see a payment due date,1i use this app to pay my car loan once a month i log in select my info and press schedule payment i like it a lot it works really well and is extremely convenient for a girl that doesnt like paper bills cluttering up the mail slot id recommend it  times over,1being able to deposit checks remotely makes it all worth it being able to check on finances including mortgage and credit card in our case is awesome too overall well designed app with easy finger print access,1never had any problems one of the few apps ive had thats never crashed everyones perfect except the new format looks very outdated now and its overall much cleaner to navigate on the mobile app old app layout in comparison if youve never had he app before it will doubtfully bother you,1i love the finger print log in and totally makes my life easier to be able to do electronic deposits i have read where some have had issues with both however i have used the ap a couple of years now and had no problems with it works as it should,1just recently my debit card was used in another state i received an alert and quickly called chase and the customer service rep was so helpful everything was taken care of i check both accounts on a daily basis before this incident and after all my my banking needs are met accordingly,1i love the chase app i can check on the activity in balances of all of our acts i can deposit from my phone anytime and transfer money to other account any time the flexibility of this app has eliminated my need to go to a physical bank at all thank you chase for this must have app,1it is so reliable and convenient i have no issues whatsoever with it so far and ive been using the app for a very long time i love how easy it is to transfer money to different accounts make credit card payments and take pictures of checks for deposits keep up this great quality,1very organized and helpful  my only complaint is that the touch id log on thing does not work properly i have to type my password in every time when instead i should be able to touch the pad and be logged in automatically other than that its a very convenient layout,1chase has continually improve its mobile app and it really allows the user to do most of the transactions through mobile phone there are a few transactions that needs to be done online over the phone or in person at the branch but it doesnt bother me at all,1easy to use and convenient its a time saver while also being a bold and bright idea with a couple presses of a button there it goes no more line linger when you need a quick fix whoop there it is    im enjoying the technology and you still can go in for a one on one some say face to face love it  whoop  whoop ,1i never write reviews but i need to say after not great experiences with other banks chase has been fantastic and this app well i am able to do everything from checking balances to transfers to paying invoices or even just transferring money to my kids in seconds so easy and user friendly great job all around,1i truly love the efficiency and the quality of service and smooth navigational ease i have when i am using the app one more reason i am staying with chase for the long haul by bank truly has my back they have been there for me in more ways than one thank you very much for constantly improving and improvising,0i hate how the touchid login feature periodically will not work and you have to input your password again i also dont like how the page showing your transactions doesnt show the overall balance in the account after the transaction another annoying thing is i cannot view my account and routing number on the app im sure this is for privacy reasons but make it optional so it can be hidden if you dont want to see it this app could definitely be improved from a convenience standpoint,1chase has always been a leader with their mobile banking product its one of the main reasons i moved my money to them the app continues to be progressive and extremely easy to use occasionally crashes but otherwise its fantastic would highly recommend,1i use my chase app multiple times a week and its functional and efficient i can easily access what i need when i need it whether its to send messages money to friends and family or pay bills chase app makes it possiblein times where there are updates being made or the system may not be available i am notified in a timely manner updates are very important to platforms like thesethe chase app is fluid and this is important for checking my finances if you made this apart of your financial tools you wont be disappointed hooray to chase and their team for creating an app thats respectable,1i think the app is just fine it seems however that every time i want to check out my accounts there is an update if i need to look at something quickly im not able because i have to update the app then go in and update my fingerprint access i just needed my balance and its turned into something akin to a hostile takeover so minus two stars for ticking me off,1my husband and i have a joint account and this app makes it so much easier to keep a daily balance we can transfer money from account to account to prevent nsf charges the alerts are great when you significant other forgets to tell you something i need an app like this to run the rest of my life,1it would be nice if when you send the daily account balances with purchases the purchases have the location or store that you purchased from in there review just a thought sincerelyits getting betteryou need to put your credit cards on the bill pay so we can see them when setting up payment,1the app works as expected two areas for improvement enable multiple login ids including touch id chase is the largest bank around many people have multiple accounts that are not aggregated under a single user id in mobile deposit skip the notification to take picture of the back of the check the dialog gets in the way of the flow,1dont you get tired of reading ratings on mundane things such as your banking appthis app workswhat is horrendous is the constant interruption of my choice to use the app by   chase asking me to rate this app  i just wasted a tiny portion of my life punching this out  fight back  demand the ability to tell the companies you choose to do business with to allow you the freedom to be a customer not a servant,1its a great app but if i review you then stop asking once a month this app asks me to review it i think that a major company and institution shouldnt be begging for reviews quite pathetic not a good sign that this bank begs for likes like some teenager trying to go viral or be noticed stop asking me to review you once a month love the app third time i rated as such now stop begging,1earlier version bug has been fixed at first deposit icon wasnt there then i signed in a few days later and all was updated   i can deposit into my personal account not just business accounts saves me a trip to the bank my life just got easier thanks chase and thanks iphone,1i work at a chase call center in a state that doesnt have any chase banks to take advantage of the free premium checking i figured id still have to keep my local bank for deposits and then transfer the money not anymore just take a pic and its in there in no time now i can have a chase bank right at home,0its bad enough that i cant even deposit my paycks at chase atms since washington mutual was bought by chase who upgraded atms for worse  so i downloaded this app for their widely advertised deposit option here i am still w my last weeks paycheck in hand cuz the deposit function doesnt work youd think chase would be hitech enough to be able to read any check but no  fix this app or your atms chase i refuse to wait in a long bank line all just for depositing a paychk what used to take minutes now takes weeks  it makes me want to switch to wells fargo,1i just switched from us bank to chase and the one thing us bank did right in their app was a  digit pin entered with the number pad to login makes it less tedious to log onother than that this app is amazing surprised other banks dont allow deposits over iphone if the check is fake and funds dont transfer the bank just pulls back the money from the account no risk,1this is an awesome app i havent had any bug issues and this is the one app besides games and email that i actually use i love that you can deposit checks using the camera and everything is so much easier because i dont have to worry about having to get to a computer if i remember to pay a bill,1this is a great app i rarely need to login to computer and can pay all my bills and do forth on the fly the only wish i would want would be the ability to select which accounts are visible other than that dont have a single complaint,1it would be nice if it allowed you to access any messages that you receive from chase  if its secure that shouldnt be an issue  it would also be nice to have access to printing off your statements via airprint capable printers    also give an option when looking at account activity to see only credits or only debits  otherwise its done everything ive needed it to,0latest update made me scratch my head for  min on how to pay my credit card ive been doing it for a few months and it worked fine but the new version hides the amount under the fold in the ui so you can see it until you scroll down and it isnt obvious at all and even when you see it you can only select the minimum amount not the current balance looks like a bug since there are two empty fields above which dont very well either bad qa,1ive had no problems whatsoever the check deposit feature has always worked for me some people might just have faulty phonesservice never got an error message this app is the perfect mobile banking application fast and simple to navigate hardly go to the bank anymore thanks to this app thank you chase anthony,0i have my credit card set up on autopay for the minimum each month to ensure no late payments however this app doesnt allow me to make additional payments its chases way of making sure they make the most interest they can by making it difficult to pay your balance down easily   the same issue is true for bill payees my pool service is set up on monthly payments i now need to make an additional payment for repairs but cant now i need to order checks so i can pay my bills sans technology very frustrating,1i love the way the app was before this latest update i hate this design the main thing is everything is so huge except for when you go to your transactions the balance and transaction info is tiny and light grey so its kind of hard to read obviously the amount spent in each transaction is important but i dont want it to be the only readable thing on the screen i just liked it much better before,1this was a  star app but i recently updated it and they took off the running available balance that was extremely useful and i was used of having that feature when i looked at account activity also it was nice to see what was pending and thats not on there either nowi hate the new update because of these two things they took off,1the only time i need to go to the bank is when i need to deposit cash other than that this app is great for mobile payments transfer funds between accounts quick pay and just to check your available balance would definitely recommend everyone to dl ,1i havent been to a bank in literally yearsmaybe an atm because of convenience chase has allowed remote deposit as long as anyone  maybe longer all my complaints about design were crushed with the latest redesign  and sending money has never been easier keep up the great work chase,1excellent app  gives a very complete view of all transactions date of deposits and this app is user friendly  you dont have to go home to log on and get it from just your home computer  no matter where you are youll have all the banking information at your finger tipsi highly recommend this appjojo,1i really love sing this app as i have been an avid mobile chase mobile user since they first made the original mobile app i have always been pleased with it and since the ios  update i have found myself loving it more ive always been proud to be a chase member and now i have one more reason,1this app allows me to track our spending anytime anywhere  we only use our chase mastercards at grocery stores restaurants amp gas stations and not our debit cards  we had our debit card compromised amp never want that to happen again  i can check our chase accounts daily which is reassuring,1i like chase bank because i can do  of my banking from the comfort of my home anytime of day since i dont like going into a branch and waiting in line like a sucker and with the app i can do my banking away from home in my car while driving just kidding the point is its very convenient bravo chase bank,1writing reviews are annoying to me great app very secure i love how when im jumping from app to app my bank details arent shown it just goes to a blank blue screen but doesnt sign me out the only thing i would change is the alerts when getting a deposit or a quick pay i had to change my settings to alert me when deposits are made greater than  cent just to get an alert,1everything works as it should on this app i can check my balance pay my bill amp because its so easy to log on amp keep an eye on my finances frequently i have even been able to catch a couple of fraudulent charges soon after they were made ill keep using it often,0i entered a recipient from my contact list to send money too and the app only took their phone number and not their email address and when you go to edit their info it allows you to put an email address in but not to search from your contact list  how many of us know everyones email address i could copy and paste it but why didnt the app get it in the first place or allow you to search your contacts like it did when i set up the recipient,1i love this app i never had any problems with it been using it for years im shock by all the bad reviews am i missing something i use it to check my balance and quick pay friends mostly sometimes deposit checks maybe its other features im not using that people complaining about,0as a customer i expect much more from this app i am a customer of several banking institutions and this app is a mere skeleton i cannot seem to view my account and routing number via the app or schedule bills see outgoing bills and so on via this app as a result i despise this app at the very least i should be able to do these things i have mentioned via the app as a person on the go i should not have to always go online via a desktop ton do these things please improve this in your next version and give it much more functionality thank you,1the app works well for me i only have a chase credit card but i like that i can check my balance on the go i like that i can view my rewards points also its nice to be able to see the payment due date with a quick tap  the main page once youre logged in is less than ideal for quick access i feel like the different font sizes made it confusing at first otherwise it works for me,1no issues on my iphone it is a little frustrating being required to update and not being able to use the app until you do when a new version is created i dont want to use my data when im out and about to update the app when i just want to easily check my balance other than that the app works fine,0this app stinks it could be that it is not designed for os  the quickdeposit function fails miserably it has difficulties with shadows on checks the use and retake functions dont work to retake an image requires doing a back to restart the photo process otherwise it seems to work ok in other functions although i caveat that with the admission that i have not tried transferring monies and paying bills with this app maybe others here have and will give a review toward those features,0was just forced to update the app in order to utilize it as many others state the mobile check deposit feature does not work once you snap a perfect photo this practically renders the application useless to me amp thus i must go to the bank to deposit my check  huge waste of time this is not banking made simpler at alli am using an iphone s with a perfect wifi connection amp full phone receptionservice which shows the error is on the developer end,0the mobile deposit never ever seems to work it would be nice if that was consistent consider going through the process while faster than going to the bank still takes some time only to have the app tell you to try again at which point i do and it still doesnt work after  minutes of trying i just end up driving to the bank and how is it that this latest update doesnt resolve the resolution while claiming its optimized for iphone  and  plusfrustrating,1besides the fact that the app isnt optimized for the  or  plus screen size this app is very resourceful not having to sign in to get a preview of my accounts is awesome i bank with the other guys as well and wish they had useful features like this now if they could only integrate touch id to sign in,1overall an easy to use app quick access to my balances and its super easy to transfer money between accounts love the photo to deposit feature it would be nice if the alerts were easier to access its a multistep process to clear the notifications when it could easily be accessible on the side menu,1would love to see touch id supported given the length of password i have  char to use this app i have to open a password manager app copy the password open this app and pete password to log on this is rather inconvenient touch id would greatly simply this and id love to see this supported asap this is the biggest ding against the app otherwise i love the flexibility to configure alerts and see transactions etc showing more transactional details that are available online would also be nice as a drill downregarding the alerts i love that i can set a minimum amount but i find the push message a little too verbose with greater than  since i want to get notification of all purchases i think the extra verboseness isnt needed thanks,0i use to use this app pay bills balance credit card update etc but now it seems the only way to use it is to upgrade the software to  or higher my apple phone is the gs and works fine but cannot support the newer version of software takes me out of the game why do service entities such as banks make easy things become more difficult disappointed their online website has lost its zest too some places just cant leave good enough alone time to move my business somewhere else,1i like being able to ck my account any time i want i am sorry they changed the content of my daily email it used to list separate transactions amounts but now it lists only one big total which sometimes makes me frantic and i have to get into my app right away to make sure all ok for the most part its a great app,1love the app went to arizona the other day and the main screen changed to the scene of the grand canyon plus all the other great features of depositing checks by phone paying loans or even transferring money to loved ones with just an email address keep up the great job with the app love the new thumb print password best app out of four banking apps,1i loveeeeeee the chase mobile app i hardly ever use the website to make changes check my balance or schedule transfers to my other account this app makes it safe simple and easy to do everything i need to do on the go and in seconds any customer of chase should download this app asap,1this is my first account ever and chase has made it totally easy to check my balance and transfer money the app is totally great and ive had no problems with it so far also as soon as you exit the app it logs out for you so if you ever lose your phone you dont have to worry about your bank account cause its safe ,1i love the convenience of banking any time any where  im still adjusting to the new app at present i preferred the color scheme of the old app better but i am able to find everything without wasting time searching  i absolutely love depositing by snapping a photo of the check front amp back  as a handicapped person this is awesome,1i gave this app four stars because it is practical and the features work well im able to check on my accounts transfer funds and pay bills it does just enough but theres always room for improvement keep up the good work chase if this app could work just like the website that would be five stars for sure,1i enjoy the convenience of using the app for everything from paying bills to checking account activity having to make certain additions and changes through the chase website helps to make me feel secure finally with the addition of touch id the user experience is technology at its finest,1i wasnt impressed with the first versions of this app but today it looks and feels smooth on the two separate devices ive tested it on an iphone  and a  plus touch id capability is great and the app hasnt failed me since the crucial updates and everything else works great as well,1i am very pleased with how easy it is to navigate through this app transfers alerts and chase quickpay especially are easy and awesome i also love the touch idit makes quickly checking a balance that much faster i also like that even with touch id a password is still required to make any transfers or do anything,1this app is terrific fast responsive one suggestion when your session times out because you were idle you cant use touchid to log back in i usually force quit the app and reopen it to log back in my password is a long random one assigned by my password keeper app so i dont even know my real password by heart,0attention chase i am about to delete your app because of these forced updates no other app requires you to update what if the new update has bad reviews like this last one and i dont want it you need to change this feature also i do not update unless i am home on wifi cause it uses too much data however this app forces you to update now to be able to use it making it very inconvenient the whole point of an app is convenience so this kinda defeats that purpose,1mobile app provides all the basic features a remote app should have viewing banking and credit card transactions and ability to make online deposit of checks unlike other reviewers i like the idea of having to enter bank password for certain transactions especially bill pay,1i use this app daily to monitor spending and accuracy my chase credit card displays with my other accounts which allows me to pay the balance everyday so im never surprised by a big balance at the end of the month the new fingerprint sign in is a wonderful time saver i highly recommend this app,1ive been using this app for years no complaints im very pleased with the ability to pay on my disney visa credit card even though i no longer bank with chase makes it very convenient to schedule payments a month in advance in order to pay my bills all at one time on time,1easy to get into app super easy to make deposits well organized vastly improved over earlier versions i can do all my regular transactions by iphone though i still prefer my ipad mini as the larger format makes it way easier but ive got multiple chase accounts and this has allowed me to do all my chase banking when and where i want,1use the app all the time love it  since latest update my finger id does not work i have to log on verify my phone by getting a verification number via text then go to settings and turn finger id back on this happens every time now since i updated to the newest version hope it gets fixed soon,1seems like they really try hard to push the cash back rewards from credit cards into gift cards or more spending you have to search through a couple of menu lists to find the option of actually getting the cash back as cash back other than that the app works well,1i have been with chase bank for years and the app that they use in order for you to manage your money is fantastic i use almost every feature from the take a pic deposits to transfers chase quick pay to paying bills this app is very user friendly and makes my life alot easier,1really pleased with this app i have two separate accounts and keeping up with them was a nightmare until the app keeps up with both and only one loggin i highly recommend this app and chase overall has provided me with all my banking needs and havent had to rely on anyone or any other banks one stop banking,1awesome app can do transfers and payments right away at the click of a button any issues i may have with my account i can dial directly through the customer service  number available a d can reach a representative within no time definitely highly recommend and five  worthy,1and several times a day at that the fingerprint log in makes it so easy and efficient i have several accounts with chase so easy to transfer money between accounts send money via quick pay pay bills etc a must for anyone as neurotic about their money as i am,1the fingerprint login is really nice however the app crashes on occasion also it asked for a password if you want to look at your order statements doesnt make any sense to me it also if you actually want to pay your card i guess thats for increased security but whats the point of the fingerprint then they also removed being able to view your statement transactions by statement cycles thats really annoying,1i use this app everyday  i love that you can deposit checks without going to the bank and transfer money one thing that i would like to see is the due dates of the credit card bills on the first page it would make things easy at a glance other than that it is a very useful app,1the app has always been convenient amp enjoyed its usefulness but the recent changes do not make any sense why can i use touchid to login amp see plenty of information but have to still manually key in a password to perform any functions it seems ridiculous that its secure enough to login amp see personal info but to read a message or make a payment i still have to enter a password each time itd be  stars otherwise,1i have spent years abroad in europe asia and now north america chase application is one of the better its easy to transfer deposit checks and pay credit card bills with little effort the overview and layout makes it easy to understand so i give credits to the designers and programmers,1ive had many bank accounts because i usually participate in their promotions when creating a new account free money anyways i stuck with chase because they are way ahead of the other banks when it comes to optimization of their mobile applications,1i can do most everything i need with my accounts from my phone check depositing is incredibly simply theres some info that is either very hard to find or can only be found on a computer routing number downtimeslimited service  seem to be a little more frequent than with my other bank over all very satisfied,1i love this app it makes my banking so much easier i like that im able to do so much stuff right from the app my old bank didnt have the alerts like chase does and if they did i would of been able to catch on that my money was being taken out of my account by a hacker before i lost all of it,1ive been a chase customer since before they were chase they have always been great about making it easy for customers this app is easy to use and does what i need to manage my accounts and pay bills its not confusing and i havent had any issues with it freezing,1ive been using this for years as both a business and with a personal account ive never had an issue and have never needed a feature that the app did not provide its simpler to use than the web and provides full functionality that i need on a day to day basis fantastic,1the chase app is easily my most important at a moments notice regardless of where i might be i can check my balance transfer funds to my children deposit a check tell when a transaction took place and so much more its fun efficient and gives me peace of mind this is one app i consider a necessity not a want,1i use this app mainly for making online deposits and it works beautifully for that i like being able to manually take the photo other bank apps take the photo automatically and almost never get it right the first time i also like being able to logon with my fingerprint,1love this app i truly love banking with chase being able to check my balances and transactions with just a quick touch of my finger is great theyre customer service is one of the best whether its through a phone or in person they are so friendly and polite i would highly recommend this bankapp to anyone looking for a great banking  institution keep up the great job chase,1i use this app every day for tracking my credit card use i was even able to prevent fraud on my card by quickly reporting an illegal use of my card most of the time i get the push alert that the card has been swiped faster than the cashier can give me the receipt,1beautiful interface finally only complaint is that its attached to chase which is a bank that has gotten too big to be really attending to its customers i guess this goes in a different emailbut the app works great i love how i can see balances without logging in i love how most banking can be done right from the app if youre a chase customer already you want this app,1this app is truly awesome over the months i have moved it from rd page to st page on my phone it is super convenient from checking balances to quickpay even depositing checks are a sinch there are way too many cool features to discuss about this app for one review so in conclusion if you are a chase bank user i highly recommend this app,1ive been using the chase app for a few years now i dig the account notification alerts daily balance updates and moving funds across my accounts with my phone i cant really think of any negative issues or experiences with the chase app ive recommended the app to my friends,1im the kind of guy that uses it for very simple reasons to look at my balance to see how much money i have and for the most part thats what i use this app for i can easily see my accounts and transfer money with no hassle i have also never had security issues which is very important,1great app it is perfect if you have multiple accounts such as checking investments and credit card the app allows me to check balances and view investments without having to use computer also being able to deposit checks is a great convenience,1you cant get cash but other than that it pretty much keeps me out of the bank  deposit checks transfer funds pay bills and send money via quickpay  easy to set up alerts for withdraws low balance etc  overall very easy to use and does everything you need,1i use the check deposit feature most often it is a very way convenient to deposit a check in the comfort of my own home i would have given the app  stars but the bank balance that shows up on the app after transactions tends to lag behind real time compared to logging in online at the official website,0putting aside my overall unhappiness with chase their app compared to my use of the citi and cap app falls very short i mostly use it for viewing alerts and checking balances the alerts are not easily found when you have multiple accounts as i do you have to search every single account to look for the push alert with a current date overall its not very intuitive and the menu is hidden in my opinion but i see the balances and the app appears secure,1its great to be able to manage how poor i am with my mobile device just got your check from work and need to deposit it before a bunch of credit and potential overdraft fees go through no problem need to move money from your ever dwindling savings even easier great app,1love how easy it is to snap pictures of checks to deposit easily we live pretty rural from everything so snapping pictures makes things so much easier also love how easy it is to look up atms and banks around your location ease of checking balance as soon as the app opens also a big plus love the app,1honestly i use this app for the majority of my banking and it has never given me any issues chase has always been good to me on the occasional overdraw and interested in helping me build my credit with them i went from no credit score to over  in less than a year,1great app that works almost perfectly i can check balances and move money with a finger i use my camera to deposit checks which saves me a lot of driving as well as time energy etc etc i have found the chase csrs to be intelligent empathetic helpful  okay there was one bad one last week  i  chase,1i have three bank apps and this one is by far the easiest and best the app is well designed and easy to use would highly recommend it especially if you want to protect yourself from fraud use the notification alerts to see if you are having unauthorized usage on your accounts,1i love this app it makes it so easy and convenient to do everything from depositing a check to sending cash through quick pay i also really like that it shows pictures of different places around town on the log in screen never had a problem using the app,1i dont have other bank apps to compare it to but i think the app is extremely handy and easy to navigate my only complaint is that when it sends you an alert it doesnt specify which account savings checking or credit card is in question so you end up playing a guessing game to determine which one otherwise great app,1this app does all the right stuff swiftly and easily easy to navigate large fonts so i can read easily transfer funds accept checks receive money all from my phone touch log in is iffy on many apps and phones so i dont use it this is the one of the few apps that doesnt need much change,1the app is good but it still needs to be more convenient chase quick pay  banking needs to improve there transactions sending or receiving funds between themselves and other bankif you could devise a better way to check your previous payments on a particular billbetter access to transfer money or make payment for other individual,1i love having the capabilities to do all my banking on my phone at any time of the day the only complaint i could have is that at times the check deposit does not process i then either have to try it at a later time or go to the bank and deposit my checks,1i often do my chase banking on a desktop computer i am amazed at how much better or an experience the app is its really quick and user friendly i use it mostly for chase quick pay and depositing checks the atm locator works pretty well too,1i have been using this app for a few years now the improvements are very noticeable and easy to use  i would only recommend an easier way to access rather than entering a password every time  take a look at capitol one security entry  you connect dots in a format only known to you and you can do all banking with one hand  just a thought,1chase mobile is so easy to navigate and is right to the second with transactions the only thing that needs work is if u do any updates ie phone number changes address changes may change on mobile but dont necessarily carry over to to main frame,1this is the best app ever if im shopping and running low on my balance i can transfer monies to my account and get instant cash  i travel frequently and the notifications help when you are withdrawing in another currency from atms  i love check deposit and quick pay   great aid for keeping track of your account ,1i worked at bank onechase for  years and they have always been on the leading edge of mobile banking and it has been the best for  years if only the service equaled it i never have a good experience in the branch or call centers but i stay with the bank because of the superior mobile and online banking,1weve had fraudulent activity on other cards and this app gives me a way to easily check new charges any time any place i use auto pay so dont know how the app works in that regard but for checking on activity its excellent no clutter just straight forward access to our info,1chase has invested significant resources over the years improving their mobile experience and we are the beneficiaries love the check deposit and touch id functionality and ability to send payments electronically my only gripe is that youre forced to sign in again when transferring money between accounts  not convenient,1overall not a bad app it rarely crashes but what app doesnt it usually runs smoothly and works quickly ive never had too many issues but the one thing i would change is the amount of money in my account it always seems like theres never enough money in there and i would really appreciate if my account has way more money in it once that happens itll be a  star app,0very few details on account main page such as available balance cant even make a payment without running into errors telling me to try again later disappointing and frustrating almost useless except to apply for new credit cards and make payments when it bothers to actually work in other words its designed to help chase make more money but not at all to help facilitate anything for its customers,1i use the app to keep track of my balance as my wife has access to the card as well and i travel a lot across different time zones this app allows us to be aware of account balances even with two people spending and not having to discuss each and every purchase this avoids overdrafts etc,1the app is very fast and very reliable never had problems with it i love the alerts there very fast so so far so good very good app the fingerprint id makes it even faster love it hardly ever use my computer  to bank thats how good it is so my computer is getting dusty know,1this is a great banking app you can deposit checks up to a certain pretty high amount keep track of accounts including credit cards and make transfers and payments only odd thing is that on my iphone at least it keeps resetting the fingerprint unlocking option so i have to enter my password and turn it on again cant figure out why,1everything from rent payments to transferring money can be done easily on the chase app its layout is easy to learn and very intuitive the push notifications can be improved a little more to provide additional detail as to what the notification is about overall a very well built app,1i just deposited a refund check from from a bank using the app  accepted on first take in regular home office lighting the had gotten really good  the deposit something cant be done in a browser  years ago it was good many retries for picture was better than driving now its awesome,1i like the new look it is refreshing very easy to use and navigate great app my only complaint is the inconsistency with using touch id to login i just paid my credit card with touch id and was prompted to review so i opened the app again and couldnt use touch id to login in the past it has turned itself on and off,1along with the print logon this app has functioned very well for me with pretty much no issues would be nice to not have to manually login to see actual statements but that has only been a minor inconvenience i guess thats where a bunch of money from fees and penalties goes when ya miss a payment app development otherwise very convenient and works every time for me,1i got everything in one place very easy to navigate and friendly to use simple quick and almost awesome app i havent had any problems  ive been using this app for years and so far it continues to offer an explicit service best of all it always gives me an accurate balance at any time not like bofas app ,1the updated chase quick pay and the overall design has made it so much easier to manage my bank account really simple and great app if you are a chase customer this app is so needed my one concern is the alerts they are unnecessary and hard to get them to go away,1if you bank with chase and use an iphone you are in luckthis is an exceptionally stable wellmaintained and fully featured app im just a single guy and do not have complex finances but everything id ever need the chase website or a local branch for i can do with this app from anywhere anytime kudos to this apps devs your work is much appreciated,1it should be transparent like going into the bank it is ridiculous to transfer from the same account to have to wait seems like lately it is taking several days for a quick transfer i guess i should start looking for another bank even though i have been with chase bank  plus years loyalty doesnt pay with companies anymore,1great app for banking but lacks a lot for playing my favorite music on the go a shuffle option and playlist repeat wound be fantastic also a paisley theme would be nice possibly a section on taking the whereabouts of my dogs could be implemented other than that very happy with the chase app,1love this app to watch my bank accounts its linked up for my credit card too so its very easy to manage my money i seldom use cash so i can see what i spend my money on right on my phone it feels secure with the fingerprintcode required to get in and the full password to do any movement of money thanks chase,1the app itself is really easy to use and manage multiple cards from the only downside is that you have to manually pay the balance every month the auto pay feature will only pay the balance due and you will carry a balance month to month despite having two options to choose from when setting up auto pay,1at first a low rating because its tricky to get started need to figure out where to click to answer security question its not as obvious as you would suspect also the password change you are frustrated by the time you notice you have to scroll way down and confirm your password again  should be easier to notice from your phone,1overall the app is great and easy to use i like it   two features i would recommend for improvement would be easier sign in using swipe or touch id feature similar to capital one   also a better imaging app for check deposits similar to a scanning app where it will automatically take photo when focused correctly and auto crop as well,1one of the things i love about this app is the swipe right option for a quick overview of all of your accounts i use that feature all of the time now my main complaint is that when i open the app the option to use the fingerprint sign in only opens every third to fifth time i love the login option but i just wish it worked all of the time like it does for the other financial institutions i use,1this application is excellent it helps me keep track of all debit purchases i use it for and sometimes i see that there is an era and i call chase bank and it is taken care of professionally and easily if i did not have this application i would not have noticed itthank you chase keep up the excellent work,1a lot of reviews say different things me myself i havent had to many problems with my money disappearing and i kno it usually takes a day or to two to show deposit and withdrawals some companys you spend you money with online etc tell you that so for me its been good of course it could use improvement but it is one of the better banking apps i have,1with this app we can access both our personal and business accounts in one place it does pretty much everything you can do on the webbrowser site but the biggest benefit is that it allows us to access our accounts on the go for us saving time is saving money,1easy to use app quickly transfers money between accounts or to pay bills and will send money quickly and too easily to payees children etc as necessary the check deposit function has worked flawlessly this app has saved many many trips to the bank yay,1i love this app the best feature is being able to deposit checks instantaneously i like being able to transfer money around when i need to to help me manage my bills ive never had a problem with this app and ive had it going on  years now chase overall is a great financial institution,1this is one of the best apps and i use it all the time online deposits by just taking a picture of the check making transfers etc is extremely easy on iphone it allows fingerprint login so you dont have to mess with the passwordcould not be more happy with the usability,1the chase mobile app is great and efficient it spares you the hassle of speaking to a representative for chase over the phone also this app is awesome for chase quick pay and transfers you can see everything you do and track all your transactions at once i love it i would recommend this to anyone,1combines well with the fingerprint quick access on ios lets me skip having to enter private password info over and over automatically shows me checking and credit card accounts separately i can make transfers deposits and payments right from the app ease of use is my top rating criteria,1this app is great saves you a lot of time you dont have to be on the phone dialing all  digits of your card to find out your balance or statements i see my mom taking like  minutes to find out her balance or her transactions this app also facilitates the way of paying your credit card i really love this app,1i started using this app when i decided to do everything when i needed to deposit a check and couldnt get out  the bank accepted the check immediately and it was done  i love it  makes life easier  it does everything i could possibly want and does it well  i highly recommend it,1the most convenient bank ever especially with kids in college and hswho dont have access to a chase bank branch where they go to college in philly the app makes it easier to deposit send  very convenient for my business and easy to navigate through the app please open a chase in philly though,1most of the bugs are gone and all seems to be working well now i really appreciate this app keep up the good work  ok please stop with the frequent forced updatesupdatednot a fan of the constant changesupdates forcing the user to relearn the process over amp over again stop with all the changes and maybe we would be happier,1this app is efficient and simple to use  i love that i can manage my accounts on my phone  i use the quickpay and check deposit features the most and have been nothing short of pleased with both  the updates just get better and better  big fan,1really love the convenience of having my bank app it is simple and easy to use never have any problems with it i can easily transfer money from checking to savings or savings to checking i dont use quick pay so i cant make any comment about that quite satisfied with this app,1the touch id is only active half the time when im in the process of paying bills i wish it was easier to see my current balance i never know if the notifications are current and for which account overall i am glad the app exists but it could be better i love the photo check deposit feature though,1mobile check depositing is extremely convenient with apples touch id i can check and monitor my balance in seconds downside every time my phone resets i need to sign into the app i always forget my password since i always use touch id i understand this is for security reasons but its still annoying,0these geniuss decided to take away the history of purchases with the credit card when the statement comes out forcing you to look at the pdf version which is a pain to do unless you print it out it used to be able  to scroll back through your purchases and then the decided to only let you check the last month and now you can only see what will be on the next statement i turned paperless billing off and i encourage everyone else too and give these idiots a clue,1this chase app has been the most responsive the most attractive and the most fully featured than any other ive seen i have used regions and suntrust and neither comes close i have had no issues with using it transfer funds deposit seesave statements etc chase app was ahead and chase customer service is great,1amazing app because of its convenience and reliability chase is always in time with email and txt alerts for if your card is blocked temporarily and if ever need be you can unblock your card with a touch of a button also i gave the app a four start because of touch id it always log off which is super annoying other than that im pretty satisfied,1what i find incredibly annoying is logging into this app to find the alert  i get a little number next to the app which lets me know i have a message from chase but then i have to go figure out where it is  and which account sent me the alert i have several different accounts  and they list them by the last  digits this needs to be updated asap,1my other banking apps give me nice per transaction notifications this one does it if you set the limit to  to send a notification then each one piles up as an icon badge and the only way to clear it is to go into the app and delete them from the message center my other apps have this down pat chase should look to capital one for easy to use designs that make sense or simple,1i read others saying that it requires you to do this or do that  those prompts are the operating system you are using  as a credit app i can find no fault it does exactly what it says it will i can see an overview without the extraneous info or i can delve deeper  to my recollection i dont remember it crashing or slowing,1out of all the credit cards and banks applications i have used this far i would rank chase app as  the enhanced navigation and available features with in the application for various accounts is very user friendly,1one of the best if not better of any of other financial bank apps available ive had  others amp the use thru phone makes the most sense for on the go peeps i especially like the fraud protect as ive had happen once amp chase acted quickly to rectify along with notifications to head off further damages,1very smooth and well organized app which makes it easy to keep track of spending and manage your money also has very easy quick pay feature which allows you to quickly send money to someones account through text or email,1i use the app very frequently and never seem to have problems very convenient and easy to make transfers and pay bills i dont make that many deposits but it works well on those occasions i dont know why people are so critical of it i find it easier to work on phone than ipad for some reason,1this app is very useful and necessary for people who are on the go and even for those who just want convenience depositing checks through your phone has never been so easy and perfect if you hate going to the bank pretty much everything you need right at your fingertips i highly recommend it,1this app does exactly what you would expect a personal banking app to do check balances pay bills transfer money and make deposits all quickly and easily and so far all perfectly safe i use it all the time and have no complaints or suggestions for improvement its great,1i can deposit checks check my balances transfer to other accounts and pay off credit card all from the comfort of my phone i hear people having login problems and such but i havent been experiencing any of that ive been using this app for + years,1i love this application you can click on it and it brings up everything about your account what you spent what you owe when your next payment is due its just so descriptive you cant help but like it love it i hope everyone enjoys it as much as i do i wish all my bills can be paid like this one,1i like this mobile app much better than the computer version amp better than any other mobile bank app i have used the interface on this mobile app is much more user friendly than the new computer versionthe previous computer version was great,1this is the most basic bank app i have compared to the  total i use regularly it offers only the basic features to view your account but doesnt seem to offer the ability to actually do your banking from the app i only have a credit card so maybe it works better for those with deposit accounts but my credit union bofa and cap one apps are all way better,0since when did the marketing team take over product development  the screenshots on the app store are very misleading because they arent showing the banners at the top of the appspecial offer just for you get great rates on your next____ see what happens when we pay movie stars to endorse our products etc  aside from that its a great app  however i pay for apps to get rid of ads and being a customer of chase should have the same effect  correct,1so the app is functional and really thats all i want in any banking app would like to see a print button added at some point if possible but overall it makes quick transfers between accounts very accessible which is what i need in my business so good job guys,0there is a flaw that chase customer support has not been able to resolve i have notifications turned off for all of my accounts but one of the checking accounts still pushes a notification to my app inbox  and all it tells me each month is that a paperless statement has been made all of my accounts are paperless yet this is the only one that sends this notification and you have to check each time because you dont know what the alert will be until you get there complete and utter waste of time and it surprises me that tech support cannot track this down all you get is a walkthrough logged into our account on safari where they see youve done everything right i just got another one of these notifications just now mdp,1awesome app able to see current balance pending charges and you can easily make payments i use this app dailyupdated i wish there was a way to lock your card if it is misplaced i have a costco citi card and on their app you can do this very convenient if you misplace your card and want to wait a day or two in hopes of finding it,1this app does everything i need for mobile banking and it does it well  i have never had an issue and the updates have been really good  deposit checks pay bills and check balances  the alerts menu is a little annoying but not worth knocking off a star,1thoroughly enjoy this app i do most of my banking online its quick amp painless the only thing i wish i could do is order a banks check or money order and pick it up at a nearest chase bank i feel very secure with the many security options available to online and on this app,1i read some negative and very critical reviews and completely disagree with most of them to me  never ever had any troubles or problems not with log ins nor with signs out i have three accounts and multiple payees to pay every mo so use it a lot for business and consider it very convenient and an easy to use,1as far as i can tell nearly all the criticisms in other reviews have been taken care of this is a clean efficient app if you find it slow it may be because you are using an older device i find it very quickthree years later everything is still true fast clean efficient,1i like the features the layout is pretty simple but it still covers all the necessary functionality you need for a mobile banking app account details transfer options and mobile check deposit i also like the option for the fingerprint id login,1i love this app very easy to find anything you need intuitive and quick i get a birds eye view of all my accounts with chase and i love being able to send or receive money by emailing i can pay my credit cards easily deposit my paycheck the minute i get it and look up my investments all in one fell swoop,1love this app i can do all of my banking right from my phone easy to use i really like that it sends me a notice if my balance goes below the amount that that i want for minimum it posts things immediately so i know exactly what is going on with my account im sure i dont use it to its full potential  but for my uses its great,1i can always count on my iphone chase app to work its difficult to use the ipad because you always have to enter password they have not configured fingerprint print touch on the ipad yet so i use my phone to access chase most of the time both apps work great they just need to update ipad for fingerprint,1the recent addition of fingerprint to compensate for periodic delays to upload to sign in is great chase copied boa i gave you one more star for this boa has the ability to lock amp unlock your debit card however you want which works great for me i travel as part of my job to different unsafe areas most times tech offers unlimited ways to security i think boa beats chase to security,1i use this app to keep track of my funds obviously and to transfer money from one account to another ive been using it for a couple of years now and its never let me down if thats all you really use this app for id say it does amazing in those factors but other ones i dont know,1update  new iphone and i love the app i can deposit by taking a picture of a check and the new interface is helpful to see account balances and credit statements right up front a good intuitive app transfers are easy but not too easy so that you can move money erroneously im very happy with it,0often get errors with mobile check deposit at best its consistently inconsistent also chase limits deposits to  per day  per month which is a lot lower than other banks ive used app is not the most well designed there a lot of taps required to view basic account info and to navigate around would be better with a dashboard view that shows balances in different accounts with any tapping required,1easy to use i am enjoying the updates to the new app it works great on my iphone  i really enjoy being able to check in with my fingerprint the preview feature allows me to see balances without checking in i have not had any problems with the app crashing it works flawlessly,1been using the chase app for several years and rarely had a problem with it the new update is great everything works as it should and as expected the app has made it so that i rarely ever have to call their customer service for assistance definitely recommend it if a chase customer,1any product chase bank puts out for their personal and business clients are well thought out it must be simple to use or im lost and im on the phone with a chase bank rep i can pay my bills online transfer funds and other transactions necessary thanks again chase you take good care of me,1im giving this five stars because this new version finally also allows external transfers among other nonchase bank accounts and mobile app check deposit limits have been raised now there is no reason to waste time ever going to any bank again you just need this app and nothing else d,1i like the convince of checking my accounts with my phone really like the feature where i can deposit checks without having to go to the bank i have not had any crash issues and the last update looks really good,1we were able to manage multiple rental property repairs service providers multiple accounts etc all from a phone courtesy of chase outstanding program updatewe have utilized chase for multiple business and personal endeavors the staff and their technology have been wonderful,1ive had this app for a few years now and it is very convenient i am able to keep with my account on the go view statements receive alerts especially helpful to keep from overdrawing and transferring money very convenient user friendly and easy to learn,1take a few minutes to explore the site before you start to rely it when out and about once you are acquainted with how to get around the site the app is a very useful tool to manage your spending and bill payments it is however a pain when the site is down and you need to use it because its down for so long,1its a great appi do not have any issues in using it it is simple concise and userfriendlythis app is very convenient an quick  i do not have to go to my laptop to check my chase account details bill payments transfer funds to my different accountsbanksi am very happy with the chase app and i will assign  stars to it,1this app is great for on the go banking features i love are i can see my bank balance as well as the balance in my daughter high school checking account i also love that i can simply log in with the fingerprint reader on my iphone i tend to log on often to make sure im on top of my bills and my casual shopping,1it instantly helps you keep up with your spending so you can see and manage it all of your cards are in one place and you can see you rewards points add up and choose your points from the app this is one of my favorite app i use it everyday just because it is so well put together,1very easy to use has a simple interface that is very user friendly i check my account every day and with touch id my account is easy to access but also very secure i would recommend this app to anyone looking for a bank to use or anyone who would be willing to switch,1i used this app for about  years and its super easy and convenient i love the fact that i can deposit checks using my phone camera which means i dont have to waste time going to the bank directly the bills for my credit card get updated fast and im very satisfied,1i have been a loyal chase customer for a while and i didnt think chase could make it easier to manage accounts but it did this app is awesome and hassel free its at times annoying that i need to verify this device with every update but i see it as a safeguard i appreciate that my accounts arent available for juat anyone to see,1i feel like there are a few things this app needs to improve on like reading the account number right i took two clear pictures and in the review stage it showed the wrong account  it included the check  and it was a bofa check if you fix this i will rate it five stars and a quick feedback button so we dont leave you bad reviews ,0i recently switched from chase to a local credit i can not believe the difference in costumer service i signed up for the overdraft protection and instead if checking you credit rating they just allow you to use a savings account instead chase charged me  to simply transfer money from my savings to my checking to keep me from going into the negative my credit union  and if you use another create unions atm to make a withdrawal a  charge compared to  be smart support local economy and save money,1love the chase app the new check deposit feature is great very user friendly watch for the  daily limit though i do appreciate the convenience and absolutely understand the security behind the limitshave had zero issues with the app and love that chase continues to provide updates to make it better,1then there is probably something weird going on with your account that was the case with me i called customer service and i let them know that the option wasnt there and they fixed it i deposited three rebate checks and theyre currently pending if you hve any common sense you can use this and make it work,1i love this app except it still has some bugswhen it takes a picture of check front or back the feature i love the most deposit from anywhere it quits and takes me back to the home screen i have had success a couple of times but it takes logging in  or  times before it finally workstonite cant get it to work lets get it fixed chase because this is really handy,1some like me have had a problem with the badge not going away i turned off all notifications and it was still there  you have to login then select more then alerts view the alert history and the badge should go away great app  this and facebook are my most used apps,1was already very happy with this app then along came deposits ive already saved countless trips to the branch with thiswill achieve perfection and five stars once theres an option to clear the clipboard after pasting ones password dont want to leave that in there while visiting other apps after chase,1i think it is useful that the locator uses current location to immediately give a list of nearby atms  but oftentimes i want to find an atm near a place that i will later visit and i would like to be able to also choose a location to search not just my current location  it would also be great to be able narrow the search down to atms with specific services,0i love this app but the check deposit feature is useless if i dont already have the amount that the check is for in my account i have to wait overnight for the check to clear but for us younger people that are just starting out and living paycheck to paycheck its not often that we have + in our account every time we wanna make a deposit i know this is chases policy but when i get my paycheck on friday and cant access that money till next the next day its uselessthere are other banks here that have moved their deposits to realtime please do the same chaseif not i will be forced to change banks also the login button needs to be pushed multiple timesand the push notifications leave a little alert number above the app icon even if ive checked the alerts many times and there are no new ones annoying,1i love this app but my boyfriend borrowed my phone to sign in to his chase account now i get push alerts via text about his balance i can see how much he has because its sent in a text to my phone this has been happening ever since he signed in one time using my phone the alerts are not showing in my account but are coming to both his and my phones  definitely not cool if you dont want people to know your balance,1 please stop burying the alerts history so deep into the app  alerts should be much more prominent and easier to access and not three layers in  thats two too many for such an important part of the app  the top left corner of the accounts overview page would accomodate this quite well and you could still leave your more page as is  please consider,1works greattwo things i would like to be improved,0 the alerts do not show which account has the alert  i have a lot of accounts and have to go into all  to see which one has he message   the check deposit is limited to   the rent check i get is a little over that so i cant use this feature,1used to love this app an its still very useful as of the most recent update i cant clear my alerts though it was already enough of a pain to have to log in and go to alerts history to clear them especially when you have to find which account got the alerts now not even that will make the number go away please fix it i used to be able to recommend the app to anyone with chase now im struggling to even keep it on my first page,0on quick pay transactions pending approval you should have a message that confirms the approval when i tap a transaction that needs my approval it just goes to a summary of the transaction and never says my approval was confirmed it would just be comforting to know for a fact it was confirmed and not just be left guessing thanks,0the app was great at first   but now its been a month since ive been able to do a deposit with it as it keeps saying im over the limit which im not  i go to the support section to report a bug but it only takes you to the unhelpful ad for the mobile app on the chase website  ironically i wasnt getting charged for my account while using the app to deposit checks work doesnt offer direct deposit   now im stuck with bank fees again   thanks chase,0the last two updates have totally screwed my ability to bank with this app im currently deployed and really enjoyed managing things from my phone since i obviously cant get to a branch while over here the first update that cut out ios  and below wouldnt let me pay cc the second now wont let me transfer  between accounts or says i have no pay from accounts active on the website ive def got two accounts in active status quickly fixing this will help thousands of people,1totally hate this app they update it it works for  days and stops working again  its actually more annoying than useful  back in the day  months ago it worked great but has not worked in a long while i constantly am annoyed and frustrated with it and think ill delete it  if anyone is thinking about downloading it just stick with the online mobile site and wait until the reviews here get better  i loved the app before make it good again please ,0i love this app makes everything so easy but after the os  update it was crashing a lot though this was the case with a lot of my apps after the update i had to restore my iphone and specifically delete this app from my itunes backup and reinstall it now its working fine again which im so relieved because it makes everything so convenient i love chase,1two things i use this app for checking balance real quick and depositing checks i loved the ability to deposit checks straight from my phone with out having to drive to the bank especially at  months pregnant in the wintertime and now the app crashes each time i try to deposit its a pointless app now i can text my bank to get the balance this is just one more little thing making me want to switch banks a little more,0this is a handy app for making check deposits and paying bills on the go but its missing one feature that as far as i can tell can only be accessed on the full site the secure message center when i get an email notification that i have a new message i cant check that message on teh mobile app very annoyingother than that i like it a lot,1this app is great for checking your balance and reviewing your transaction history on your phone but i have never been able to successfully deposit a check it doesnt provide any reason why it just makes me go through all the steps of taking pictures of the front and back of the check only to then tell me to go to a branch or atm and make my deposit there why offer this feature if it doesnt work off to the atm ,0this app is only good for checking balance and doing basic banking function i hope to see in future version of this app that mimic the feature of the discover card app where i can sign up reward points on credit card and view statements if i have a managed account i cant view detail of the portfolio if all these feature are incorporated in future release than i would rate this app as  star,0if i could i would give zero stars ever since the last update i have been having lots of issues my account balances take forever to clear and sometimes it doesnt show accurate balances i get charged for things i pay one day then they disappear the next day and then reappear the following day charges dont go through as they used to and remain pending for many days its unpredictable and i cannot trust it even to do transfers from savings to checkings takes days to clear and remains pending on regular business days,1the only reason i moved to chase  years ago after demo of every big bank online banking interface was chase had a better one  but im very disappointed that they have basically ruined their interface by constantly updating their app and ruined the customer experience  look at the many bad reviews all dated march   all because of an unnecessary update causing us countless loss in productivity  stop updating leave it alone if it works  i may have to change banks again if this isnt fixed  fire your app programmer,1i abuse this application soo much i never even use my computer to login anymore most of my friends and family have chase so we use the quickpay option a lot to transfer money also its made my life easier with depositing checks to my account i dont have to make time to go to the bank anymore,0one thing that bugs me is that after exiting the app and timing out then upon returning to the app you can momentarily see the last screen you were on including the account activity screen before backing out to the login screen i feel this is something that can be improved i wouldnt want anyone seeing my account activity even if momentarily,1i dont know what they did to mess this perfectly fine app up but they did as mentioned the keyboard does not go away when trying to make a transfer mobile deposit or while using bill paythose are  things that used to make the app greatworst part its been like this for over a month even after the latest update seriously thinking about switching to another financial institution these are necessary functions,1i think it is ridiculous that i can not access the messages in the customer center from the app or the mobile site i have an iphone  i know i have a message because ive been emailed i can not bypass the mobile site to open the regular site on my phone which is ridiculous and the app wont lent me go see messages why and why no nonmobile or full site version in phone its so frustrating,1but i really do enjoy the bank in the palm of my hands seriously its my goto app for simple transfers check deposits and the regular check up on my account balance its a quick and easy tool to use to keep track of your mula and spending if you have a chase account i would recommend this app,1im also having the same trouble as reported by andjj on dec   every time i try to make a deposit via my iphone s i get to the step of taking a picture of the check and as soon as i click the button to snap the picture im dumped completely out of the app  i dont think ive tried making a deposit since the most recent update so perhaps something got broken during that update,1the app works great i can pay bills add payees view account balances transfer between accounts the only thing i wished it can do is view deposited checks that cleared who ever is reading this please add the feature were you can view checks that have cleared if they add this feature than it becomes a  star app other than that it works great,1ive always used this app to help manage my bank account as it is much more convenient than driving to the bank constantly ive always appreciated how useful it is but i really like the new design it is many miles above the old ui for surethe app now has a great smooth looking design to match its usefulness,1this is a  star app  it keeps me up to date with my chase accounts anywhere i happen to be at any  time  everyone should be a chase client because they are the most customer friendly bank ive ever be associated with in my  years     thank you chase and thank you  lauren melancon  my chase personal banker at chase in gonzales  louisiana,1i really like having an app for my bank account i am always away from my laptopcomputer and being able to just log in from my phone and then on top of that having the capability to do what i need while on my phone is so convenient and just makes life a bit easier,1i dropped my credit union not long after this app came out and switched to chase i appreciated the cus personal service the few times i went in the branch i need portable convenient access to my funds and chase makes it as easy as can be i love the photo check deposit probably the killer feature for me,1i love everything about this app theres no need to stand in long lines you can just make a deposit from your phone funds transfer from accounts its easy to balance your account to make sure you do not overdraw send you a email of fraudulent attempts  banking security  this app is the best thing since sliced bread ,1ive made less trips to the bank because of this app  i love the quick pay and on occasion the bill pay  only problem i have is that i cant transfer money to my external acct with this app chase said the app is not set up for external acct transfers  maybe theres a safety reason for that but its a major problem for me when i only have my iphone and i need to do that transaction,1i use it for checking my balance real quick when im out or transferring money to and from my savings its very basic but thats all you need for on the go banking too many features would be bad if someone you didnt want had access to your phone and password a+,1i have used other banking apps and none even come close besides the obvious check depositing and transfers the other features offered are amazing for mobile app setting up alerts for all my different accounts was simple and streamlined hands down one of the best smoothest reliable apps out there,1this is one of the best apps i have and i have a lot of them i use it to check my balances make transfers between accounts pay bills make wire transfers and to even deposit checks it is a real time saver keeping me out if bank lines it has never given me any problems and i feel secure with their safeguards five stars,1i love the new chase app it is so easy for me to manage all of my accounts from making payments to transferring funds to sending money via quickpay the app is convenient easy to maneuver and it updates in minutes which is great i feel secure banking on the go i recommend it to anyone with chase accounts,1this app makes my banking so simple i havent had to go to the bank since getting this app i use the online bill pay through the app as well the best part is the check deposit system my roommate leaves me a check for bills and i can deposit it right then and there from my couch awesome,1please allow us the ability to open each transaction so that we can the rest of the info after the  it would allow us to see where exactly the transaction is going to this would drastically allow us the ease of balancing and ensuring the correct amt is goingnot going to each payorother than that the app is a lot better than the old one,1the chase mobile banking app works great becoming very dependent on it only thing that was mildly confusing first time i used it was how to get to historical account informationtransactions the text on the prompt buttonsinitial screen could be touchedup just a bit to help prompt the user to their account transaction history  without having to guess n tap around so much,1i love the functionality of the chase app i am able to take care of all my banking needs without getting in line at the branch i can transfer money between accounts pay my bills and even do quick pay transactions its done in real time amp these days i dont know what i would do without it,1the best thing about this new or upgraded chase app is that the upgrade was seamless didnt even notice the change until it asked for a review to me thats a plus because i use the app to check a balance and pay a bill and then leave really dont care what it looks like great work,1i love the app just the flaw is that you cant see the memo on the things you spent or when you transferred i would like to be able to click on the amount that i transferred or bought and be able to know what it is that i bought or why i transferred that amount instead of guessing or going through receipts to know,1i use this app every day and have been for years the alerts you can setup are wonderful to stay on top of your account also the check cashing feature and being able to transfer money to friends and family on the go is so helpful i highly recommend this app,1great apponly problembug i have noted so far is in the alerts when you go to see a new alert it does not take you there instead you have to actually find it from all the account and figure out which was the unread one hope they fix it otherwise works perfect,0tired of seeing reviews that knock the app for not having capabilities that are more suited to a laptop people need to get over themselves this app has about as much as you can manage to safely pack into a mobile device its good looking and has lots of abilities the check depositing is easier than the last version if you want more features go to your laptop bravo chase,1the app often seem to hang when depositing it hangs while waiting for a confirmation it hangs when depositing multiple  checks it seem to scatter the checks into the unintended accounts it happens in my ipad and iphones chase seem also to be offline often on nights and weekends when i deposit checks and pay bills i need to endure this as i dont have an alternativeupdate good app they have made a lot of improvements text is now hard to read small text and grey colored iphone accessibility option will not have an affect here,1i know it is hard to believe but this huge company finally come out of the dev dark ages and did something worthwhile for an app i was totally stunned totallyfor years i have been able to schedule a card payment from this app then they update their website and the app a few months back and i have lost  of the reason to have this app on my iphone s,0you can do everything on this app from depositing a check to sending someone money in  seconds absolutely love it super fast and efficient as well ive literally been standing in the grocery store line without enough cash in my checking and switched enough money over before she was done ringing me up love it,1whats the point of having mobile deposits feature if amount is limited to to sad couple thousands a month if i am a business its great feature to have on the go if i can deposit all the checks i get not just one a month and then i gotta walk to the branch for the rest also no way to see what is available balances on my credit cards and credit cards accounts just payment to pay that is good for nothing this app is missing a lot of things long way to go better off using website,1the ability to take a picture of a check for a deposit is awesome i havent been to the actual bank in weeks the interface is clean and simple theyve come a long way since the earlier versions so if its been a while you should give it a try,1the chase mobile banking app is all somebody could ask from their bank it has an easy to use interface and  an aesthetically pleasing layout the app never crashes or fails perhaps the best part of the app is how easy it makes getting in touch with customer service i love this app,1the chase banking app is a wonder of efficiency its so easy to check all of our accounts and even easier to pay someone in the moment the user interface is simple and intuitive and the feature set is pretty extensive great app will only get better over time,1chase mobile app is the best simple elegant amp easy to use i can access all my accounts checking savings credit cards retirement and so on in one convenient place to do almost everything i just that notifications could go straight to the source instead of figured out highly recommended,1this app is easy and quick for checking my spending and setting up a paymentpaying my bills so i never even have to log on to check them on my computer anymore anyone who has a chase card should definitely have this app,1the chase banking app brings the convenient banking functions of an atm to your smartphone such as balance management and check depositing it even allows you to set alerts that react to deposits withdrawals and more complex operations however at the moment the alert function would appear to be nonfunctional nonetheless this app provides a much appreciates convenience,1i use the mobile up for  things to check my balance transfer funds between accounts and deposit checks however now when i try to deposit checks the app always crashes the second i snap a picture the screen goes blank and the app closes this is ridiculous the whole point of it is having the convenience of doing things on the go total fail,0i have no idea why this app has such a low rating fake reviewsi have been a chase customer for years and i love it great functionality deposit checks as you go quick pay your friends among many other things they constantly update it and the look and feel only improves every time,0i am astonished at the delay in fixing this problem  like others i have called and tried all kinds of finagling with the app but  the check deposit use function continues to be inoperable  in this day and age this delay is hard to understand  it works on my husbands newer phone so i hope chase doesnt think it is fixed just because it works on some phones  its particularly annoying when i see all the advertising chase has in place for this app  get your act together chase,1two updates ago when chase optimized the app for iphone + they didnt take into account the screen resolution for iphone s was different  if you try to use quickdeposit the use amp retake buttons do not work so you wont be able to deposit checks with the app  chase was notified of the problem but they seem to have ignored users with older iphones  i wouldnt recommend this app to users of iphone s if they want to deposit checks with it,1this app is so clean according to other reviewers theres some functionality issues for me and what i do with it ive seen none so far take that for what it is i use it for two purposes paying a credit card once a month and checking its balancebofa can take notes this is how you make a banking app ive seen chase only improve since ive been using it,0the chase app is innovative and extremely useful i can do most of my banking from my device however some work still needs to be done to provide all the features of the website there is no way to cancel a quick pay transaction for example but in general good stuff,1seems like chase has decided to make sure all new phones are able to download there apps  however for the rest of us they say u can use an older version but it does not allow u to use it so if u need access to your accounts u will not be able to use the mobil app tried calling them  times each time i got a different story  now i need to use my laptop to do banking seems there has to be a better way  they claim they have not had any issues,1wow so much negative  no problems for me the site is clean amp easy to visually look at wo glitches  ive not had any problems  heres what i would like to see when getting alerts it would be helpful to show me immediately which account is generating the alert i have  accounts and i need to look in each one til i locate the alert irritating overallno problems,1this is a fairly decent app it really helps on the gohowever the app shows i have one active alert and it is not true  i have logged in on my mac and deleted all messages in my secure center but it still show there is an alert not viewedoh and another thing you cannot delete alerts on a mobile device at least the iphone,1i can easily handle  of what i do online from my phone love the quick glance option  feature requests a global aleta view where it lists unread alerts in one list by account vs having to individually check each account and guess whats new  each time i check my alerts i see a history of so many alerts back but it doesnt seem to outline which alerts are new  something about the apps behavior makes them immediately read once you choose the account  second thing would be touch id for login although i understand a bank has a lot more to loose security wise,1great for checking balances on the go nice to be able to sendreceive money via quick pay amp deposit checks stars because it should give you a running balance after a debitcreditevery so once in a while the log in screen just slides away left hahaha i have to force close and restart the app it usually works pretty well though ,1they continue to add to the app without fixing some of the things that are wrong  messaging has always been a challenge for this app now it doesnt work at all  i have  unread messages that are attached to the icon but when i go into secure messaging nothing shows up  i appreciate the improvements elsewhere in the app but messaging needs some major focus update  the messages are working now thank you,1this app makes my life so much easier i am the bill payer in the house and transferring funds and paying my chase credit card could not be easier i have completely switched to using this app instead of the full website or mobile website this app is a true life and brain saver,1pretty good app but push notifications are way too complicated you get the notification and then you have to drill down into the app to find some sort of webbased interface that works about half of the time it definitely needs some workother than that the app does what it says it will do,1i find the chase app very easy to use and intuitive ive not run into problems yet that werent already being addressed by the developers alerts come very quickly and there are a variety of alerts options you can set up which i highly value,1i have this app for one specific reason and thats to keep track of whatever money i have held in my accounts with chase its simple fast completely up to date and crystal clear if you have an account with chase and want to keep track of your account there is no question get this app,1chances are you wont use the majority of the features i cant say anyone i know uses the check banking feature compared to other banks this app is well built and user friendly intuitive layout and simple navigation overall a good experience compared to simple bank this app is not as good but it is definitely one of the better banking apps,1and now with the addition of fingerprint recognition it is even better  i use the app several times each week to check balances and transactions  occasionally it also serves to transfer money to an ally account and to pay bills  all in all it is one of the best apps i use,1absolutely love the convenience of using an app it lets me know everything i need to know my family across the country is now addicted to using quick pay  when its time to buy a big gift for family we can just quick pay each other immediately,1without a doubt one of the best apps ever made it comes in very handy i dont ever have to call that lousy  number and go through like  menu steps to hear my balance or recent transactions no more annoying automated operator saying please enter your account number then press pound ugh but anyways i highly recommend this  star app,1i love that chase is always uptodate with all the latest and greatest in technology for banking i appreciate the massive amount of atms and branches this app just takes the experience to the next level my favorite part is that i can use apples touchid system to log in also the quick balance check is pretty handy,1chase youre the best no other bank like it you have the best app i highly recommend it to everyone its so easy to bank with you i cannot see myself with in the bank you take care of all my personal banking and business banking dont stop trying the new ideas always be the first,1i live  miles from the nearest chase after a couple of moves and can stick with the same bank because of this app makes my life much easier also dont have to worry about any late credit card payments making it feel almost like a debit card,1i love my chase banking app but i wish that you could add the ability to see to whom ive written a check on top of just seeing the check number and amount this keeps me from having to look it up in my check book or on my laptop if i cant remember who i wrote the check too im very busy and this would save me a little time but important time to me,1this app keeps me uptodate with everything thats happening with my account its easy to use and easy to navigate through new functions are always being added that i didnt even realize i wanted this app is also surprisingly gorgeous for being a banking app,1this has become indispensable in my life we live in a rural area where there isnt a chase branch readily accessible this app allows my family to stay connected to our bank of choice the ease of check deposits and online bill pay is convenient and simply handled highly recommend,1ive been using the app since they have released it and it has gotten so much better over the years i really like the improvement of not having to have the icon alert after you have logged on to the app because it used to stay forever ,1i love the chase app its really responsive quick pay is a synch and being able to view the history from all my accounts easily in the app is awesomemy two newest favorite features are  swipe left to see a summary super handy for account balances at a glance and touch id login finally,1i love the ease which chase app allows you to do all sorts of transactions with also being able to contact them at anytime by way of phone or computer i would suggest to anyone to use this app for most of their banking at the same time i hope this doesnt put people out of work,1chase has done an amazing job updating and standing out from the rest of the banks out there they have also managed to stay ahead with their finger print tech that lets you login without the password but secure enough that you still need a passcode to make changes on your account im forever a customer,1i changed banks from a small local bank i loved supporting to chase be caused i needed better online banking i couldnt be happier with the mobile app  from the beginning it has been easy to use and surpassed my needs amazingly each update makes it even better giving kudos where they belong,1the app basically eliminates the need to go to a brick and mortar location for any typical transactions and is easy to use love the alerts feature as it has alerted me to two  fraudulent transactions that were stopped because of that only upgrade id like to see is tag the alerts so you dont have to search every account thats why i havent a  as opposed to  stars,1i love the chase mobile app it allows me to have all of my bill information in one spot i do not have to log on to different sites to pay each bill or enter my bank information numerous times i feel this app is more secure to use for bill paying thanks for making my life so much easier,1this app makes banking extremely easy  i love the ability to deposit checks and to check activity  i am in england and wanted to see if a deposit i am expecting was made  every upgrade has been an improvement and the menu is much easier to maneuver than it used to be  one of my favorite apps,1im a first time user of a debit card and this app makes it so easy to track my transactions as well as transfer money to my savings account i never have to open a computer and now that you can log in with touch id its even faster no reason not to get this app if you use chase,1you need to fix the bugs in this app read these reviews from all those user reviews from depositing checks issues you guys were first in the industry in this so what gives to how touch id doesnt work and i cant swipe left to just check the balance you giveth and then you taketh away need to have your app developers fix these bugs that used to work just great,1works great for me i use it to quick pay family and friends all the time pay bills transfer money between my accounts and the new fingerprint log in makes me happy thank you im the kind of person who doesnt have time to go to an atm and this app makes that possible i love chase,1i love this app i use it all the time i only go to the bank to deposit cash now one problem is when depositing checks it sometimes cant read the bank info and ill have to make many attempts to deposit it will eventually accept it kinda annoying overall one of the best apps i have,1the app is extremely useful and easy to use love the check deposit feature no need to make a trip anymore to deposit checks also love the send and receive money feature dont even have to write a check much anymore wish they would have the check image feature on the app too its only on the desktop,1i love that you now have touch id as the password optionso convenient however it makes absolutely no sense to have to then enter my password to do anything once i enter the app every other banking mobile app allows for touch id and thats it once youre in youre in i dont like that chases app is always the last to adapt to technology advancements its very inconvenient when other institutions are already doing this,1absolutely amazing app but on the new design you have to back out of so many menus to change between personal business accounts also when trying to transfer money or pay bills it takes too long to drop down so i end up tapping something different other than those items its a  star,1the app is solid and works as advertised  only change i would add is morebetter feedback when the network drops during a session overall a solid banking app that is consistent with chases in branch experience  would be cool if chase could tie some services with the branches to the app as well,1i love the fact that you can quickly review your balances without having to sign in i love the fact that i can quick pay some on and its available instantly  its fabulous to have that ability when you have children out in the world very easy to access and keep track of,1its a nifty little app the addition of complex password and touch id made it even better i do find the requirement for a password to see your statements or secure mail right after you logged on a little inconvenient it is a great way to keep an eye on your spending a nice addition would be account freeze right from the app when your card is lost or stolen or a if frauds suspected,1i use this app almost everyday its super easy to navigate and it has all the functions the full website does whether it be for checking my balance depositing and ordering checks quick paying a friend the chase bank app makes it easy to get it all done right on your phone,1this app makes pretty much everything simple and the interface is intuitive and smooth the only thing i would improve on is the ultimate rewards which is always slow to load and not as pretty as the rest of the app,1this is the greatest bank app for sure have had several other banks while in army and living all over the world and had so many issues chase is and remains to be my only bank only two things i would like changed is the max mobile deposit amounts per deposit and the cap for the month wish i had a local branch here in tn,1wonderful user friendly  especially for some who feel computer challenged my entire family now banks at chase because we have never had any issues in the past  years the app makes it so easy to monitor my spending and transfer between accounts,1this app makes me proud to be a long time chase enthusiast love my bank as they always have the best technology best app on my phone always works and takes care of all my banking needs i am blown away by every update i have a few bank accounts at other banks and chase by far has the best technology highly recommend,1the app operatesmost of the time the issue i have is the requirements for a new password and the difficulty the app poses to make gem match one needs to be some sort of savant to get all of chase demands met to change a password how secure is it really if i need to constantly request codes so i change my password or if i need to make notes because i cant remember  bizarre nonconsecutivespecialuppercaselower casecharacters,1i like this app it is very convenient and it has a pleasant look compared to the website through the computer but it asked me if id like a touch id and it helped me scan my finger print and since then it never worked every time im about to login it gives a popup touch id with a big circular dot but it never works when i touch it so i had to cancel that proceed with my usual login this is very inconvenient can you help fix it,1its cool nice lay out however i dont like the immediate touch id requirement if im only attempting to use the account preview also when i use touch id to sign into my account i shouldnt be required to use my password its just like using the account preview page its really kind of redundant to use touch id + password to do anything within the app i understand the added security but i highly doubt someone in the world has the same finger prints as i do,1i love my chase app it is so convent i can deposit money transfer money pay a bill and all that just with this app it saves me so much time from having to go to the bank i think i use this app at least  times a day i know for a fact there is never a day that goes by without me opening up this app i love it sooo much goooo chase,1very easy to check balances and deposit checks with touch id  also have made transactions while walking a pack of dogs so you know its easy  some transactions require you to enter your password so that would be easier if that were also by touch but overall a very nice experience,1this is the best bank app i have ever used ive only been with chase bank for about a year and this app has made my life a lot easier i can pay my bills at any time and make deposits from home also if im ever short in cash in my checking account i can just transfer from savings in seconds love it,1theyre good there is a reason chase is the best and at the top sure they have problems too no bank is perfect personally i hate banks all together ironic seeing that i am writing a review on one but i am a member and out of all of them i think chase does it best solid bank and helpful people in the right circumstances im happy with them so far,1like the ability to check accounts quickly via fingerprint scan and now the ability to transfer funds to linked accounts at other institutions from my phone vs having to use my pc and the main website basic and easy to use,1the app used to be very spotty and not so user friendly but with the addition of more features its gotten way better i think they should work on the redeeming ultimate rewards link instead of loading another web browser it should just load directly also the secure message center needs some serious work,1super user friendly and very convenientyou can deposit checks sendaccept quickpays pay bills check your account balancestransaction details find atms and branches pay your credit card  and so much more i wish my whole life was as organized as the chase app is,1this app is very easy to use i like the quick view of accounts using the finger scan but the security of having to type in your password to do anything else  the features are self explanatory and easy to maneuver through  the app has yet to crash on me unlike many other banking apps i use,1i love this bank and love this app even more i rarely have to step foot in a branch because i can pretty much do it from the app thank you chase for creating such a well designed and user friendly mobile app also thank you for hopping on board with apple pay right away definitely  stars,1its one of those apps that you can really get your use from thatll never give you a problem i never have an issue where it crashes or constantly signs me out like some other apps do whenever there is an upgrade its quick and changes are made for immediate use,1this app is well crafted intuitive and has a feature for almost every aspect of your banking needs just be careful with the online statements they will post the dates the bank process the payment not the actual date you made the payment it really screws a lot of people up,1this app is so easy to use i love that i can add the payees for bill pay through my phone im also able to easily view the checks that have cleared my account just one push and the check image appears no need to wait in line to speak to a personal banker to see an image of a cleared check,1ive been using this chase banking app for quite awhile now i love it easy to use navigate even pay bills with transferring money between accounts is fast and easy i occasionally even deposit checks with it i also prefer their online banking system to others i have used highly recommend and chase bank dont fix what aint broke,1love that its always reliable quick and easy to use the touch login option is time saving and i trust it being secure because at times i may have my wifi on in a different location and i have to manually login because it doesnt recognize my device im ok with that great app,1there is no other bank app like this where can u take a pic of ur check transfer funds and check ur account balance that is up to date when they suspect fraud they will hold ur account text you and call you to see if you authorized that purchase thanks chase keep up the good work just need touch id and alerts quicker and u will earn these five stars,1the one improvement i would like to see is the ability to remove accounts recently when i lost my wallet and credit cards after having my cards replaced i wasnt able to remove the earlier accounts having to stroll through zero balance accounts to reach my new card can be a pain  times,1ive really appreciated the ability to closely monitor my account balance and activity in these days of electronic payment i need to watch to make sure that incoming payments arrive and this app makes it easy the quick access to my balance sans password is a big help when im on the road,1love the convenience of transferring money from savings to checking or vice versa also i absolutely do not like taking checks in to the bank to deposit fro christmas or birthday so i like being able to take a pic and deposit via this app thumbs up plus i can see which branch is closest to me and their hours,1i have a checking savings and two credit cards with chase this app makes managing my money so easy payments are a breeze even paying monthly bills and sending money to friends and family can be done in a snap thanks for making an app that truly helps me manage my money its been great,1i only have  chase account so i dont run into any of the notification issues that others write about my only suggestion is that it would be nice if there were a heading showing the sum of all the pending charges it could be right beneath the current balance on the home screen,1i have other checking accounts with other banks where you can make edits to reflect the actual payee in the payment history i recommend this as an enhancement to the application so place modify the application to allow the customer to edit the payee field to more accurately reflect who was paid thank you,1im fairly new to having my own credit card but this app makes it very easy  i make just about all of my payments through the mobile app and its so handy to be able to pull up my balance even if im out on the road  chase has made an easy to use simple but visually pleasing app  great job,0im brand new to this appor i should say its brand new to me ive used it once so far and find its quick and efficient i have  accounts wchase and could navigate the alerts wsuccess i was hesitant to log on to a bank account via mobile appfearful of any security breach but asking around and reading the other app reviews here i feel more confident so gracias chase,1version  was easy to view especially with bill pay and using it eliminated duplication of payments the review needs work on all version should be more related to desktopas a family with no access to a branch its imperative for us to keep good track the later versions especially ipad is confusing and spaced out a cross screen that yes visually appealing but not user friendly why fix whats not broken refining the original would have been perfect but the redesign is terrible,1i had this app for almost two years now and it never give me a problem it make the process of seeing my alerts and messages a little difficult but that for security purposes i would recommend this app to anyone with chase to get this app,1one of my only concerns with this app is you cant connect the findabranch option with google maps instead of apple maps which has improved but i still prefer google maps otherwise the app updates my info and accounts very quickly no major bugs and easy to log in and out,1this app is great i use it all the time i have paid bills checked my balances deposited checks amp looked at my credit cards on here i really like being able to see all my balances without logging in amp i like being able to log in with my fingerprint i havent found anything wrong with it,1the app is quick and easy  i have never had a problem  it is easy to navigate pay bills look at balances etc  i am very pleased with the functionality of the app and when i do need to go to the bank chase has been easy to deal with everytime highly recommend,1i love that i can pay my credit card right through my phone without having to sign into a webpage or sending in a payment i also like i can see what all is on my credit card  it makes it so much easier for me to manage my credit card spending,1it is pretty efficient still needs work  the very first place would be to link with finger print to gain quick access and do away with email confirmation  the next thing is when it switches to payment menu that full amount is shown besides the min payment to facilitate the pay process  will need time to use other features,1i love this app it makes mobile banking fast and easy but often it does not recognize my phone and i have to turn back on the touch id because it turns it off automatically i have to request identification codes often because it does not recognize my phone but other that this inconvenience it is a very good app,1my favorite feature is being able to swipe right on the apps login page to check my account balance without even logging in a setting you can enable or disable to your preference i havent experienced any problems in about a year of using the app  stars,1its nice to see all the accounts at once but viewing the details of each account and making payments are difficult and takes up time it would be nice to see the important information like apr and opening and closing dates of each credit card i get so many emails and secured messages after making payments navigating to alerts is also annoying,1i am at that point of no return meaning ive had a couple of bank apps but none can compare to chase app so very amazed to what i can actually do on this amazing app im not going to go into detail but if your wanting easy quick reliable secure access to you accounts from an app  recommend you download this app,1i use it for everything deposit checks transfer money from one account to the other put money into family members accounts even use my reward points for my chase sapphire card  dont have to ever go in to a local branch for anything anymore ,1since i live more than  miles from the nearest branch bank the remote deposit function has been especially helpful for me and has worked flawlessly other functions including bill pay fund transfers and the fingerprint security have also been very convenient,1i use this app so often its nice to see in real time any pending transactions as well as the ones that have cleared my husband and i share the account so when one of us makes a purchase it can be seen so we know what we have before we make additional purchases user friendly,1i work in it so any tool that can make my day go faster i appreciate the backend work that goes to the success of apps like yours  thank you for the clear and easy to use mobile option i rarely need to step into a branch which saddens me as the customer service provided by your employees are second to none,1it is easy to navigate and i can find everything the only thing i dont like is that the same links for credit card transactions sometimes opens a list of transactions and sometimes just opens an over view of the card but other than that it works great,1i would give  stars for it doing what i want it to do another  stars are added because i know its secure and convenient at the same time being able to check my accounts and pay off credit is amazing and handy i am glad that this app exists it saves so much time,1great app i use it everyday to help manage my accounts when life gets busy and i dont have time to run by the bank to make a deposit i just take a picture of my check and deposit it online brilliant ive signed up to receive account alerts to further help me very easy app to navigate,1i never thought id be reviewing a bank app let alone leaving a positive review but i love this app theres a lot of useful features like new alert section and they did an excellent job at bringing a more human consumer friendly vibe to it it makes me use it more which has made me better at managing my finances thanks,1generally runs well low volume of crashes and is accurate  the layout is smooth and aesthetically appealing  only major problem i have is too many logins  after logging in i have to login again to see my ultimate rewards points progress for the current month  same applies for my billing statement  it can become very redundant and time consuming,1this app is useful and easy to use you have the choice of several options in the settings in regards to how you want your notifications this app is helpful for me to balance my account the fingerprint and swipe options swipe to see balance without logging inare also convenient,1this app allows you easy access to your balances and information on your chase accounts it has a check deposit function and everything the website layout has the app is well designed with a good format but sometimes it freezes up for me,1could not do without this app now that we use it for all our basic banking needs i only go to the atm now for cashwould like to see new alerts listed separately  i have a number of accounts and cant recall what alerts came last finding the latest one really is impossible once we review the alert it can go away thanks for this app,1i love chase and the app is everything i need love the deposit feature because i dont get out much it works for me and i like it better than other bank apps  theres one thing there should be a red flag whenever you have received a quick pay so that you see it as soon as you sign in,1i also dont care for big banks but have had chase account for years out of necessity like everyone else i now like that this app alerts me of deposits withdrawals status etc im also able to up to date all accounts and transfer  easily from one account to another very easy app,1user friendly app does everything i need a banking app to do check balances pay bills transfer funds between accounts  even w my credit union i send money to family and make deposits from my phone banking on the fly  love it  plus if i need cash  chase is always nearby works for me,1the bank part works great love the fact that i can take a picture of my check and deposit it the only part i wish was better would be the viewing part for your credit card its not very clear when your payment is due charges in this period its just very basic but i highly recommend it,1quite simply one of the best apps i use elegant simple intuitive and attractive other than the alert section which continues to be awful this is a perfectly designed app bravo chase now apply this simplicity and beauty to your website which is way too busy and youll be the perfect company ,1ive been using this app for quite some time its my go to app my balance is always updated and i love that i can do quick pays to my family and friends i pay my credit card bill directly through this app and make deposits saves me a trip to the bank,1i have had a college debit account for four years now and i have always used this app it has always worked great for me i think it is really convenient and being able to take a picture to deposit checks with the app is so convenient thats my favorite feature by far,0ive been using the chase mobile app for at least  years now  it has not let me down once  so user friendly and very easy to change setting and alerts i have a hacu credit union app as well as bmo app nothing but trouble signing in not sure why i even still have accounts at those banks  love you chase mobile,1after logging in i was forced to update there was no functional improvement with the new version just lots of advertising pushing a visa on the login screen offering an eric clapton album while im trying to check my balances only if i use the visa theyre pimping honestly how about sparing me the noise so i can just pay my bills please its bad enough that im assaulted with advertising everywhere else but to bombard me while trying to do my banking is shameless,1i use this to access my chase credit card i dont have a chase checking account all the access needed to view activity make same day payments and view reward points  makes it easy to keep a zero balance never had a problem with the app on ios,1this new version of the app is a significant improvement over the previous version i was able to deposit a check on the first try whereas in the previous version i had to photograph the check several times before i obtained a satisfactory picture nice improvement,1love the app its got all the functionality but no clutter love the touch id integration love the account balances quick view and i can see my checks as an image when i touch on the transaction thats awesome even better than than the website where it opens it in a new window and takes a while,1so far the app has done what i need to do my only complaint is when in quick pay to accept money the accept and decline are right next to each other in other words ppl with large fingers or if you are not careful one can hit the wrong action chase space out the accept and decline buttons to avoid accidental actions,1chase used to have great online banking on both the web and mobile  recently they made a lot of changes to the web app that created a muddled experience however the mobile version remains spot on  very easy to view transactions deposit checks etc  one of my favorite apps,1my daughter just walked me through setting up the mobile check deposit appno waiting in rush hour traffic no lines at the bank just choose an account take pictures of the check front and back and prestoall accomplished from right here at home,1greetingsmy thanks goes out to chasejp morgan for creating and updating this banking app without this app i would be compelled to drive a very long distance to my nearest chase banking institution in order to submit check deposits  keep up the excellent work and customer serviceyour devoted customers appreciate you and all that you do,1i have had this app for almost  years and i have had minimal problems however i consistently have + notifications for the app and cant make them go away there are not + messages in the secure message center or anything besides that i love the app amp especially the check deposit feature,1the app is absolutely indispensable giving me access to all my accounts at my fingertips love the touch id feature i only wish that the branchatm locator had an integrated map feature for when i need to find one in a pinch while walking down the street its extremely inconvenient to have to look up each individual address,1easy to use nice feature to get a quick balance check without having to login deposits are easy and fast its easy to issue checks using your payees all your accounts are easily available the only thing i can think of as am improvement would be to enable fingerprint login,1great app and keeps security simple yet still has challenges to keep account safe from thieves fingerprints and passwords have a purpose and layers of security awesome app and trust it to keep out the bad guys while making it easy for my needs dont change a thing just dont add advertisements  those are annoying,1this app helps me so much notifications on occasion are too much but im glad i get them this is by far the best bank as far as customer service and trust ive experienced i love the ability to make transfers and payments when im on the go and have overlooked something i need to take care of,1love the ability to use quick pay and make payments all within the app i have certain alerts set up so i am notified when there are certain changes to my account really appreciate the touch id it makes logging in much easier and more convenient thank you chase,1the app immediately lets you keep track of your transactions quicker than lighting if you ask me personally   lets you know also the remaining balances of your accounts and the final balance after a transaction was made   i love chase ,1this app makes my life so easy i just log in and i can see everything from my bank account to my credit card i can do everything right from my phone deposit checks to transferring money i can even pay my bills i dont know what i would do without this app i love it,1ive been using chases bank app since it was first launched amp ive had no issues        their servers are good and even when theyre going to be updating the app or chase banking theyll notify their customers that their service is going to be limited the check by phone deposits are awesome the online transfers to my accounts are so convenientthe chase quickpay is something both my fianc and my friends like to use so overall id rate this app  plus stars if i could because its such a convenient easy to use app that avoids me from having to wait in those sometimes long lines on fridays ,1this app makes it so easy to check my balance look at a statement and make payments to my credit card i finally got my husband to stop his paper bill and start using this app i use a variety of other apps for bill pay and this is by far one of the best,1less trips to the bank  able to do almost everything through the app from transferring money with in my different accounts to quick pay  to even deposit checks  to paying bills amazingonly reason i go to the bank now is to withdraw money,1have used the app for over  years there was an issue of accessing the inbox to read messages that was fixed now the only problem i have is the credit card access i cant setup anything with the credit card on there am a big believer in autopay to the credit card and use of the mobile app if i cant do this its a fail which is why i gave  stars hopefully this gets fixed,1i love chase   it is getting better like that on your phone app you can see amount of the pending charges on your credit card the freedom card needs a fico score added to it  we need a credit card we can use on line that you create a random number for one time purchaseslucille,1since chase changed their web page ive been having difficulties seeing properly the contents of the page finding what i needed where to tap click whatever this little screen instead is amazingly clear and easy to use i get what i want right away great,1this app would get  stars except for the fact that it forgets a crucial in my opinion  setting after a day or two specifically i set the app to log on using the fingerprint touch feature available with the iphone  and it reverts back to password only after a few days  its irritating to have to frequently update that setting,1this app is awesome i do just about  of my banking through it and it has just about everything i could possibly think of that i would need i believe the only time i had to go into a bank branch was to personally diversify some of my accounts otherwise i really havent had the need to go in,1i wish i could do more within the app i also have a discover card and i can add debit cards to make payments i can do almost everything besides a credit line increase right from the discover app and i wish chase was like like it would also be nice to have a pin to log in instead of remembering a user name and password but its not a bad app overall just not as great and streamlined as it could be,1ive been using this app for years in fact when we moved out of chase bank area i never had to change banks with mobile online check depositing and all that you can do either online or the mobile app theres literally nothing i need to go to the bank for,1one of the best things is being able to login with my iphone security also provides uptodate info the scan check deposit is also really good i think it had only been  check i had to take in a rebate check can do almost everything on here except get cash,1this app is better and more intuitive to use than the website provided of course your online banking affairs are in order the only drawback is that you cannot research financial products offered from chase like you can on the website all banks and financial institutions should have an app like this,1this app works very well is fairly simple and intuitive maybe my only wish is that i could access my whole account numbers in the app not sure if its for security reasons but if im able to move the amounts of money around that i am should also be able to see my full account numbers for reference,1what do people expect the only thing that would make the chase app better is if it came with a  drop into my account when first downloading it otherwise great app its to the pointwhich is checking my account balances and accepting quick pay ,1every once in a blue moon i am not able to check my account due to updates but i feel that they give customers enough head notice amp the app is convenient amp easy to use it would be even better if the display showed as much as the full online website which i imagine is possible,1the chase app is the best app i have on my phone i check my accounts every day i can transfer money with the click of a button and deposit checks by snapping a picture i love how quickly everything shows up it allows me to keep track of my accounts with ease,1i enjoy being able to look amp see what my balance is i dont always have the  to do what i wantso i like being able to see if the funds are there st i also like being able to transfer  between my daughter amp myself when she needs help i do this app has been a great help thank you,1ive been using this app for about three years and have had no problems at all with it i love being able to remotely deposit checks right from my phone it makes it so easy as ive set up alerts to notify me of when im close or going over limits on my different accounts,1its extremely convenient and easy to use i used to hate when people wrote me checks because i do everything online and this makes deposits easy have never had a problem with it accepting photos and the money is usually available in hrs or less,1probably the most annoying feature is having to enter account password within the app after already authenticating via fingerprint simply to pay on my chase credit card otherwise it works pretty well although it can be challenging to find some features navigation could use some work,1great app that provides accurate and secure access to my account what i like most about it is how quickly it sends alerts regarding changes in my account status in contrast to other applications that i have i used this app is by far the most accurate with respect to account statements and up to the minute alerts overall,1considering my previous bank was a localregional bank that was well behind most in technology this app and chase overall is a great experience for me love the easy to use features of the app plus the quality customer service i get in person and over the phone,1ive had the app for  years i have  chase credit cards and a checking account the app is easy to use all my important information is on the main page its easy to pay my credit card bill on my phone depositing a check by taking a picture is awesome very intuitive app,1i use the app daily balancing the checkbook is an unmissed memory and check deposits via smartphone camera is terrific i just wish emailing money to someone nonchase customers wasnt so burdensome to recipients where they have to give up account info etc i would use that feature but recipients dont appreciate the intrusiveness,1i love this app i rarely ever have to go to the bank anymore since i use the mobile deposit for checks i use the app several times a week to check account balances transfer funds pay bills etc the app makes banking so easy with the touch of a button from wherever i am,1uh not sure really what to say but they app works for what it is i can check and see my money with no issue i like the quick wipe that lets you see your available funds with out signing in sending money through chase quick pay is easy and very convenient,1i do love the app the only reason why i didnt give it  stars is that sometimes when making a deposit the app tells me repeatedly that the image wasnt clear i saw the preview it was clear a week later i try it again and it works or i have to make the deposit by atm its odd but most of the time it does work now if i can have it work with the apple watch id be happier,1the worst part of the app is there is no touch finger print support why it makes it s million times easier and more secure this must be resolved if you wish to consider you app a good app for banking its response is slow and lacking at times when i make a payment it does not show up it takes days to show why all other banks show my payment immediately this also needs to be fixed,1i like chase n its services and im banking with chase since  the only thing i would like to suggest is bring the chase branch in albany too albany is capital of new york n im surprised that they dont have any branch here i visited albany some business proposes when i tried to find chase here didnt find it and had to drive all the way to kingston an hour drive think about it chase,1i love this chase app ive been a chase customer for more than  years now and i love their services this app is easy secured and very convenient for me since i dont have always time to go to the bank and deposit or check my balance i also love the quick deposits feature,1i cant event recall the last time i used the chase website every feature and functionality you could ask for in your everyday account management is available on the app no service issues no speed problems no complaints at all,1this app puts everything i need to control my banking at my finger tips the only thing i would add is a feature to temporarily freeze your card because i use apple pay a lot and leave my card in the house and something forget where i left it still get s,1good app but agree alerts could use some work everything seemed to be fine for over a year relatively happy with alerts then out of the blue i stopped receiving apple notifications and text alerts i verified nothing had been changed in alert configuration so cant explain it and still cant get it back otherwise satisfied with app for occasional use,1great app i use it everyday to track my activity as well as to make payments to people using chase quickpay depositing checks is made so much easier by just snapping a photo of your check the app has never had any glitches i would totally recommend it if you bank with chase,1i have had three bank accounts and two federal credit union accounts with different electronic apps for each and this is by far the easiest and quickest to use on top of that chase has been the best bank ive ever had an account with with their professional courtesy and efficiency i love this bank and this app,1this app is a must have for anyone on the go whether im checking my account balance wiring receiving money from family and friends paying bills or need to find  a nearby atm this app makes that possible in a matter of seconds if you bank with chase you need this app,1this app makes everything easier i can deposit my checks without having to go to the atm it allows me to make transfers from my saving and checking accounts or send money and make payments quicker now with the fingerprint the app is much easier to access as well,1chase mobile app is amazingly awesome  i can do everything through chase mobile app from simply swapping the app to the right to check my balance without having to sign in to signing in and taking care of my banking needs  you are a  mobile app  thank you chase for being caring for your customers,1this app was great until my latest update took away the ability to see all previous transactions at once now i can only see transactions since my last statement or else i have to click on each separate statement and view them individually i never realized how nice it was until it was gone bring back this feature and the chase app will again far exceed any other mobile banking app,1ok i can do most of my banking and inquiries here on this app its not quite like the desktop web version yet meets  of my needs if i need more involved transactions id rather do that from the safety of my home desktop web version this app does what i need it to do while on the go better than b o abullst of  america,1i love this app i pay all my bills and get notified whenever a credit card is used or a deduction from my accounts is postedasked to rate this app again still very happy with it like the part where my iphone beeps when ever my creditdebit card is usedthird time asked when ever i use one of my chase cards my phone rings and i tell the cashierwaitress about this chase service they are amazed and i think they will think twice about using any chase card they may come across          easy to transfer funds between accounts and keep track of my finances      im a  year old retired widower,1i love this app  it gives me all the information i need anytime and anywhere and really makes my accounts so much easier to manage wherever i am i can easily see if a transaction has been completed and see my account or credit card balance  two thumbs way up,1use the mobile app daily to stay on top of possible fraud pay accts on mobile chase fraud dept is outstandingother banks could use your app to improve their customer service your latest update is awful now i have to look at statements which is difficult on a smartphone can i go back to seeing all purchases and payments,1i dont know about anyone else but i have no problems with this app i used to have problems depositing a check but that seems to have been resolved with recent fixes its relatively easy to find the links to what i want to do and takes few steps to complete my transactions,1chase mobile app makes mobile business transactions effortless chase quick pay is excellent depositing mobile checks very efficientvery clearly able to see finances in multiple accounts personal business family and transfer as needed,1i do just about all my banking with it move money between my account and my spouse my daughters account is linked also so when she went out of town with the church and ran out of money i was able to add money to her account without any fees attached that was great the app has saved my family time and money,1i love my chase bank i have been in the chase family for  years now n i can honestly say we have a great relationship ive had other bank accounts with nearby banks but to me none of the other banks can compare to chase my wife n daughters also bank with chase n they also are satisfied customers thanks chase for allowing us to be a part of your extended family,1works great clean look love to be able to deposit checks just by taking pic   minutes at home in pajamas day or night compare to bank visit with driving parking form filling line waiting use the app all the time sometimes it warns about future limited  availability but didnt  experienced any yet,1i use it for simple things like viewing my balance and transferring money i also have the chase flying miles credit card and it automatically was connected to my account it makes it so easy to make a payment and check my credit card balance i love this app,1this is a great app dont know why some very bad reviews are happening ive had chase mobile app for a long long time there were growing pains along the way but it has continually improved and this is appreciated i have issues with chase with credit card payments but it is not the app,1the app is very reliable and i love the touch id feature keep making the improvements and adding important functionality suggestion add chat support and ability to see spending trends to better manage budgets other than that overall it reduces my requirement to have to stop by a physical location,1overall the app is great i would like to be able to see my credit score and other information related to my credit that chase provides on the full site through the mobile app its aggravating to have to use the full site when i dont have easy access to a desktop computer,1this app is the definition of useful i can do anything and everything that has to do with checking and updating myself on what i am doing with my money financially i can check how much i have spent where ive spent it and how much i have left the app is super easy to use and is very secure overall this is a great app to use,1i use this app all the time to stay on top of my finances works perfect every time only complaint they removed transactions history only show transactions after your last statement if its needed to see anything beyond that you have to go back an see your pdf statements its very annoying and makes it harder to speed up the app,1i use a lot of different banks mobile apps and most are frustrating to say the least this is the only one that i can quickly do transactions on my phone without a lot of circular mumbojumbo thank you chase for making this work well,1ive had chase for so many years and they always have been amazing and their app is super easy to use i live in north carolina now and we have no chase banks here but i still use it as my primary bank as it makes it easy to bank with them even though theyre no branches in my state,1the app is very easy and extremely convenient to use times are changing now guys no more phone calls to check the balance no more having to get in line to transfer money no more paper statements arriving at home everything can be doneviewed by using their simple app,1i love being able to check the balance on my accounts and see which checks cleared etc i love being able to transfer money between accounts with the app it has saved a trip to the bank late at night thank you,1i really like the app ive had it for years and there are two big things id change  the app used to sum all your accounts and doesnt any more they really should bring that back  your credit card balances should be listed in the red so that you see the balance as negative and not an additional savings account,1i find the chase app to be userfriendly ive had great success and little to no problems while accessing it which is typically paying my credit card recently i challenged a retail charge on my bill they took action immediately to resolve amp reimbursed the full amount thank you chase,1this app is great to pay off credit cards deposit checks and manage all your chase accounts i am a fan of both chase bank as well as the app if you have an account with chase especially a credit card you will be a lot better off if you have their app,1this app makes banking so easy  my daughter is away at college so the chase app makes it easy for me to transfer funds to her wherever i am  i havent had an issues or problems with the app  depositing checks with taking a picture is so easy one try and it was done  i love it and highly recommend it,1in a perfect world everyone would realize that money currency financial debts and obligations are all illusion that answer fewer questions than they raise but theyre hard questions and it would require some serious ageofaquarius paradigm shifting to address effectively in the meantime im happy to have this app so that i dont have to wait in line go to the bank to deposit checks,1i wish it had a trace pattern to log in with i get tired of typing in letters and numbers for my password i wish i could just trace a login pattern instead i like how i can make a payment even before the transaction post i like how i can preview my balance without logging in,1currently when making a payment through the app user cannot choose amount of payment desired except for the options givenplease make that available to be able to enter the amount user wants to pay whatever amount  or  any desired  let the user enter the digits one by one thank you,1the app is great and i have no problem other than every time i try to deposit checks through the app it never reads the picture correctly i literally tried eleven times before writing this review and i have now found myself having to inconveniently drive to the bank to make a deposit its a little annoying dont know if anyone else is having this issue but it is a bother,1the app looks good logs in easily and gives a quick look at multiple accounts i havent used it to pay the credit card so cant speak to that only complaint is i couldnt find the redeem rewards for statement balance theres tons of gift cards but i didnt see the redeem for cash or statement balance option on the app if its there its buried,1this app has become essential to do all my banking remotely so much so that ive moved very far from any chase branch and all my dealings are neatly handled by internet and this app ive only been at any branch  times in the last  months and still for things unrelated to my accounts  foreign money exchanges  kudos for the intuitive application,1i like the convenience of using the app however id like to continually be able to use my fingerprint for access instead of having to put in a password each time otherwise its a pretty good app  i like that i can see my uptodate balances during the week,1chase app is easy to use and i have access to a lot of features found on the website i love being able to deposit checks via app saves me a trip to the bank i use it daily to check my balance and verify transactions that have gone through,1chase has the best tech when it comes to online banking and this app is an example i use the app to do everything send money pay the credit card transfer money and deposit checks hopefully they can keep it up also the local photos on the login are nice too,1app works well for checking bank balance purchase history and even using quick pay alerts keep me updated about whats going on i havent used it for any other service features so these are all i can comment on,1the ability to deposit checks from your phone any where is very convenient i also like being able to connect my chase account to external accounts making it easy to move money around,1ive been using this app for a while and have no complaints so far when ever i need to check my account balance make a payment or a quick transfer all i have to to is open the app and within a few minutes im done so quick and convenient to use its a must have app,1ive had this app since i have had an iphone and its been the only app i can think of that doesnt occasionally have glitches or issues being able to at a glance see my financial situation is a blessing i especially appreciate it when i am worrisome about losing a card for example thanks chase,1this app does all bank functions i need just when and where i need having ready access gives the level of trust and security one expects from their banksetting alerts makes the process of keeping your finances in order quick amp easy,1great app please make it even better please make things better for the app like alerts on your account and other things and safe and security and stay logged in longer please make it better great app ahd better for going to the bank all your tvijgs are right here keep updating it for better features,1in my pursuit for banks chase has been there for me as the top tier their app is proof of that its easy to use its not cluttered and it offers the most powerful functionality of any i know of the ability to take a picture of a check and it deposits it without having to go to the bank is amazing i love it,1i use this app everyday to view transactions check status of accounts transfers via chase quickpay amp also to external accounts check deposit functionality is excellent the alerts work all the time based on set parameters overall the app is very stable and transactions securedhighly recommended,1it is super easy to use and has everything you could needexcept i had a hard time finding the routing numberonline on a computer it has it listed and honestly calling chase isnt too much of a hassle overall the pros outweigh the cons,1ive used this app for years data load quickly and there is plenty of functionality right from your phone i dont know why i cant use touch id any longer but maybe im not using it correctly that all being said i doubt a user would ever choose a bank based on an app and for that reason i absolutely support chase,1great for quick money transfers and checking your balance and pending balances but it does not give you your account information so you can never find out whats your account number it only shows the last four digits even after you securely log in besides that its a good app to have,1i am also a user of the td bank app which may be the superior banking app in my option because it offers touch id which makes it very convenient to sign into your account if you do so often and it has an option to view your account number which is also very important and saves you the time of opening your laptop to find it online please update this app thanks,0makes checking my accounts paying bills and making transfers easy and convenient  you must log onto a computer to view statements change passwords change login and change address but it does make  of my banking needs easy,1when i download the professional chase app in order to keep track of my money and how much money i have in my bank account i do not want an uber add on my first page as im trying to login it is completely unprofessional and it ruins the app im tired of accidentally clicking on it whenever im trying to just get into my stupid chase account please remove it this app  deserves only one star and this one star will not be changing until the ads are removed and they do something to better this app,0very easy to use and so convenient love the app despite not being able to use the fingerprinttouch id option a little annoying at this time with all that said the app is still so smooth and easy to use and navigate two of the many things that has kept me using the app,1the moron app developers are at it again when i first started using this the direct deposit of checks usually took for five times before it would actually except the deposit then about six months ago and update was put in and it seem to work fine now the idiots put in another change and its worse than ever i guess the only reason people stay with chase is because they dont illegally open accounts for people behind their back its certainly not because of their software,1i love being able to deposit checks and do my banking from my phone i wish that the camera for depositing checks had the option to add a flash sometimes its too dark to deposit and i have to find a way to light a check which seems dumb because theres a light on the back of my phone that i could use so easily,1probably the best banking app out there touch id is great allows me to do transfers between banking institutions and brokerages most phone apps dont allow that i like having it all in one place the one thing theyve done that i didnt like but not app related is removing overdraft protection using a credit card account i never used it but it gave me confidence,1great app for cc use i dont do banking but i have a cc with chase its nice now that it just shows my current spending now i dont have to think when the month started to see what i spent in that month wish this feature would go over to the ipad along with the quick view of balance now all we need is touch id so i dont have to do a full sign in,0really nothing to rate on other than it works does what i want it to do and maintains accuracy of my account what you want your app to do if youre looking for something different see the professionals that do this for a living they update when they notice bugs but we have to let them know of course i guess this is where we do that,1does the basics if you want to use an app but i still choose to login via a browser even on my iphone amp ipad because the website is much more robust offering more features for example im able to filter my payment activity specifically by repeating payments or all bill pay activity this is a must so one doesnt have to scroll through everything to see only recurring payments oh and why doesnt the ipad version still after over a year not have login touchid capability,1the chase app is fantastic i can pay bills get deposits cash checks transfer  to my family members review all my checking savings and credit card activities and more while sitting at home i am discovering more assets in this app constantly response time is so fast for any activity so user friendly,1i am a selfemployed music teacher so i receive lots of checks every month from students and parents i dont have to go to the bank anymore to deposit them which is a huge help for me plus they recently increased the monthly deposit limit so its even easier now,1i find this app quite useful for checking balances monitoring transactions and making my credit card payment i have direct deposit through my employer so i cannot comment as to the issues others are discussing re photosdeposits im happy with this app,1i have used this app for a long time i use it for business and personal banking its great and saves me so much time i use it almost everyday i so glad that i can use it to deposit checks also we moved to an area where there is no chase bank without the app i could not continue to be a chase customer,1i have no big issues with the app thus far i am able to check my account balances deposit checks see pending transactions i love the chase quickpay being able to transfer money to friends and family one thing that may need altering is the alerts sometimes i get the text message alerts and sometimes i dont,1this used to be an awesome app it moved into the good app category for basic stuff its an easy to navigate app but it used to be in real time now all of a sudden it takes days for stuff to show up and post this was never the case before and its very frustrating i always found them to be incredibly efficient in that area and all of a sudden lately it moves at a snails  pace  please fix this whatever it is,1i love being able to do pretty much everything using my app rather than having to actually go to the bank it allows me to deposit my checks and transfer my money with just a few simple clicks overall i think it works great and i would highly recommend it,1ive got no complaints about this app able to send money with quick pay check pending balances and view statements through it rather than online never experienced any bugs with this app overall easy to use and great for keeping track of your account,1app works well on my + i really like how it lets me use touch id  my only suggestion for improvement is  allow full accesscontroldisposition of messages amp alerts from this iphone app currently it will display a superscript numeral on top of the icon normally indicating a number of messages andor alerts but the app reports that there are none to view,1the chase banking app meets all of my needs efficiently and simply the interface is easy to use and simple to find what i need depositing checks works very well paying bills and my chase credit card works smoothly the updates to the app have been welcome and not confusing,1this app is very convenient and user friendly you can mobile deposit and you can access all the information and services for the most part that you would using your desklaptop computer i just wish chase bank would open branches in south jersey ,1i like that i am able to navigate this app quickly the quick pay feature comes in handy sometimes the balance needs a day to catch up with transactions,1i love using the app to deposit checks for it saves me a trip to the bank although i must admit i enjoy the bankers at chase too  chase makes an effort and succeeds to do whats right for the customer having the opportunity to retrieve my banking information with my phone is a plus keep making us happy chase dr mkh,1i use the app to deposit checks my only complaint is it wont take checks without clear border confirm transactions against my budget and transfer money between accounts i like that i can search transaction history for certain companies in certain timeframes,1i love the app so much although i cannot make major changes through it i appreciate everything that i can do plus not being able to make major changes through it means if my phone ever goes missing at least i dont have to worry about my information being compromised,1for what i use this app for i really like it easy to log in easy home screen to navigate easy to sort + search your various transactions simple check depositing via app i also use the find branchatm link often  the only reason i gave it  stars instead of  is because routine maintenance seem to make the app unavailable more often than most,1when my banker showed me how to download and use the app i didnt think i would use it that often being able to deposit a check when i cant get to the bank and checking balances is a real help i also use it to transfer money between accounts and even pay bills something i had only done online,0app is greatgives you the info in a clear way weve been with chase since march  amp have always been very satisfied chase is a great bank  the employees are always super friendly the bank has awesome services makes banking pleasant amp easy all services make it easy to pay bills or send friends ,1this app started off good when i first started using it a couple years ago now it only serves to frustrate me and waste my time it constantly times out wont load says to try back later every action i do or different page i want to see it spins for a good  seconds if it even loads at all i do all my banking through apps so if this wont be fixed im switching to any other bank since all the other apps ive tried work much better than this one chase get your app act together,1i use my app for almost all my banking i do deposits transfers balance checks etc and find it super convenient i love telling my husband im going to the bank and then whipping out my phone and making my deposits right at home ive been using it to pay bills and find that so convenient love the app,1i love the chase mobile app because it makes it so easy and safe to pay my bills transfer money and check account balances its accessible pretty much all the time for assistance over all i like the fact that i can control my money to the touch of a button,1if i can save a trip going to the bank by making my credit card payment here is  stars for me also by using quickpay has saved me from going back home to get my debit card when i can easily send money that im going to use to my friends debit card or my relative,1ive had this app for a while now and its been working nicely for me there have been a few small issues but usually updates take care of them quickly i use the check deposit feature quite a bit,1everybody is different i like this app i find it easy to use and swiping reveals more functionality i like the fact that i can do my online banking on the go nearly everything i need is here my only complaint is that i cannot see the payment history in the billing section other than that it works very well,1the app is great i barely login from a browser anymore it does everything ive wanted to do so far and is relatively easy to use in all my times using the app ive only been frustrated with it once while transferring money the done button was hidden underneath my keyboard overall good work,1ive used this app for years now i use it to deposit checks remotely it always works great check my balancealways up to date and transfer money from my checking to savings account which always works immediately for these purposes this app is perfect keep it up,1i do most of my banking through the chase app  from local wire transfers to depositing cheques and moving money between accounts  its great for tracking all my expenses and watching ali transactions  the only feature i would like to see improvements is the management of the secure messages  the app is not friendly and clean and viewing and deleting messaging is cumbersome,1i love this app it is the best i can do a lot of things without going to the bank and that is great keep it coming still loving the app im wondering what happened to my fingerprint to open the app it was there when i strayed to new app now its gone i keep having problems with the fingerprinti do love the new changes thankslove my chase,0who else but your best friend is going to handle something so valuablein a momentyou can check the balance in multiple accounts you can transfer  between accounts you can verify if a check cleared and view spending historya real modern convenience that is simple to use available and ready a modern necessity id say,0the app offers touch id but every time i open the app it says that i have to log on with my password and turn on touch id which i do  still doesnt work most times  so i have to identify myself and change my password since that now will not work either  takes forever and is silly  tonight the make a payment function will not work and keeps telling me to try again later  worst cardbanking app that i use,1this new app for my ipad is not what i want for an app  i have to use my ipad in the up position short sides on top and bottom this is not the way i like to use my ipad most apps let you use it the way you want to my new ipad uses finger print sign in but this app doesnt have that availableprogrammers need to remember that this is my computer and i want to use it the way i like to use it not the way they want me to use itif you fix these things soon you will get a good review,1love the app and virtually everything works as it should im only giving  stars because for some reason when im not connected to wifi it wont let me login with touch id it doesnt even ask for it and when i manually type in my password it wont log me in no idea why maybe its just my phone iphone s but im not sure,0i think this is one of the best banking apps around im able to do everything with ease including deposit checks with the help of my phones camera i cant think of anything that i would like to change with the exception of the poor interest rates that chase pays you for using your money lol,1i use apps from several different banks  chase is the only bank i have consistent trouble logging in whether on the app or website  first the site would mess up and get confused if switched between users often locking out our accounts until we called insecond the password requirements are going way overboard  studies show this is actually less secure and way more frustrating for customers  i wholeheartedly agree  please fix the password requirements,1this is a great app and i recommend it to all who have chase credit cards its very accurate and has little lag as far as up to date postings all the idiots writing  stars because it doesnt show this or that instantly just need to use their brain and stop relying  on freaking technology go chase,1my account was locked up by an individual trying to access it unsuccessfully i might add due to security measures put in place by chase called customer help desk and they were very helpful in unlocking and suggesting i change my log on password fast and friendly service as always thank you,1i love this app on my iphone but theres no touch id available for my ipad ive had to use the iphone version that doesnt look so good on the ipad but having easy access is worth iti also wish the alert indicator was on the account so i wouldnt have to search by rack account to find itstill a  because of all the functionality it has,1its great for the basics but it doesnt have the full functionality of the website  for instance i have business accounts as well  id love to be able to run payroll  quick pay and wire transfers are available but not the ability to pay employees  id also like it if touch id was available  it would be so much easier to open the app on the go,0i have never had any problems with this app and i love how easy it is to use at first i worried about it being safe but have used it for a couple of years so far and love it  being able to deposit checks without having to go into town saves me so much time great app ,1i have used it in the past with mixed results  but i stopped using chase card so went dormant  now i am starting to use another chase card started using app  first thing i noticed no support for apple watch not even notification wow  first financial app not supporting watch in any function i use citi and capital one app notification in watch is very helpful for me  get notified as soon as there is charge in my card  other functionalities are ok  nothing outstanding,1i have just started using more features of the app and they all seem to work great i really dont have anything negative to say all the info i need i can find with the app i am able to send family money or pay a bill i can deposit checks easily everything i need on the go,1there are a few things that i cannot do on the app that i need a desktop for and i think the elimination of that division is the goal  but the app and web applications have decreased my banking time to a few minutes a month  how i love to deposit checks c my phone   and managing my college kids cash flow is a breeze  really great,1i recommend friends and relatives to chase all the time  i have been with chase since  they are nation wide bank and when i call for info i get a real person from the us on the other end of the line the app works great we travel as missionaries here in the us and are seldom with out accessscott saxton,1ive read several other reviews and dont know what all the complaining is about the chase app is the best banking app ive used i use three other banking apps they do not have the features the availability the ease of use of this one and they take  or more days to post activity i do in their app  thanks chase,1this app is so great i love how it uses the fingerprint to login and it also has the preview accounts just in case i dont want to sign in it is so simple and user friendly and is easy to maneuver i literally do everything on the app deposit checks transfer money and check my alerts for spending,1the app itself is not bad but depositing checks is like herding cats  my other bank snaps the picture automatically once the check is close enough to the camera and is clear  win chase i have to take a picture  times and they all look identical to me before mobile deposit is accepted  one time i got so fed up with it i ended up driving to the bank  an upgrade on this feature would be great,1blazing fast and so much more intuitive than other banks clunky interfaces so far above the crowd and keeps updating the user experience comes in handy when traveling without my laptop or desktop easy to read and fast updating keep it up chase the new big blue,1touchid support for logging in to check balances do transactions etc is a huge help since i have a strong password its a pain to enter but fingerprint is fast and easyalerts are hidden in a way that takes about  clicks to see them if you have multiple accounts still a problem in this version,1so happy with this appenables me to check my account whenever wherever i am the only complaint i have is the fingerprint touch sign in option keeps getting turned off without me turning it off which is very annoyingi have to sign in to turn it back on and i dont always remember the password on the spot which undermines the convenience of the app,1does what i need it to do and doesnt crash  i only use the more basic features such as balances and transaction history and transfers so i cant speak to features like check deposit i also use chases text message alerts because i find the inapp alerts to be insufficient,1other people are having with this app it never has failed to do what i wanted it to do no glitches no hiccups nothing checking balances paying bills making transfers everything behaved perfectly dont want to say people cant use an app properly but,1when i start the app the most common functions should only be one click away like deposit a check pay a bill or see my balance that should be zero clicks when i deposit a check on my mobile phone pretty sure im going to need my keyboard should not have to turn it on the app overall does what it needs to just not as smoothly as it ought,1best and easiest app to use very clear and concise love having all my credit cards and bank accounts linked so i am able to log on and see everything in one spot i have never been disappointed my whole family uses chase  that will never change great job chase,1i liked the chase online website better before it underwent a total overhaul a year or two ago hard to keep track the iphone app does a decent job of offering atyourfingers access to functions comparable to the website could probably be a bit better but serviceable nevertheless,1i have been with chase for  years i have  accounts with this bank  chase is the best bank that i ever had  i been with banks in the pastamp there was always some issues going on chase got the most talented customer service  hours a day  days a week   thank you chase ,1this app is wonderful it makes it so much easier to keep track of my accounts notifies me of my balances and any transactions that post over a certain amount with the touch of a couple buttons all my banking can be done whenever and wherever i am i couldnt be happier with this app,1there are few things in life that save you time money and effort this app works great it makes it possible for me to spend more time doing productive and profitable things instead of standing in line at the bank thank you chase for trying hard to earn my business every day,1lately i have had many a check rejected for deposit and was requested to go to a branch to deposit i successfully deposited online with another institution im not sure why it is happening with just chases app perhaps it has more advanced safety features that is causing but it is not helping me make banning easier otherwise enjoy the ease and simplicity of other features,1
