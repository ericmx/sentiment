everything works perfectly,0
very military friendly and the customer service is the best they really strive to help the customers,1
its so convenient and easy to access the account information its great app,1

very annoying since every few weeks it asks me to login again and set touch id settings,1
use every day and its so easy to use love all the features on it,1
as far as banking apps go chase is the best,1
i just got the app and works perfectly i ,0
i had to choose between here and bank of america and idk they just seem to win my votes  i love chase ,1
this app is the same thing as their mobile site  the user interface after log in is terrible  all the transactions are messy and not laid out very well  it looks like chase put about  minutes into creating this app,0
good app but needs the ability to show your total combined funds from checking and savings like the regular site does  if you add that its pretty spot on,1
but dont leave the password saved or if your iphone is lost you money may be lost too,1
this isnt even an app they take you to their mobile site after login sure you stay within the application but its not native  leaves a lot be desired,1
im very satisfied with this app its quick and very useful if you want to keep an eye on ur money,1
a lot better now with  update its an actual app now and not a pointer to their mobile website,1
needs to show pending balance and itll be perfect,1
this app worked until the latest update then it just goes around stuck in a loop and never logs in or lets me see my accounts anymore useless app,0
awesome update i love the new check deposit featurekeep it up chase,0
the photo check depositing feature works sometimes frequently does not you go through the whole process just to get an error message mostly a waste of time,0
for a mobile banking application chase mobile is pretty cool looks great and works perfectly,0
this app save me time by doing my deposits thru it  hrs and thats it,1
would give it  but deposit feature never works,0
should be able to use quick deposit feature on new ipod touch wcam,0
could be better if i could view use and view my rewards points,0
i love the quick deposits but why the limit  trying to deposit expense checks and i can only do  because of the  limit  silly,1
this app really needs help i believe alot of the problems stem from the mobile server being downhas anyone ever been able to get the check deposit by taking a pic to work i have tried it on g and g phones to no avail overhall,0
the mobile chase app is pretty useful when it works do not i repeat do not deposit your checks over your phone or ipod it takes me two days to get my money most of the time so i have to wait till they release my money to use it its pretty dumb but useful when it works,0
im starting to question the security of the banking apps i had credit card information stolen from both chase and discover since using banking apps deleted them all beware,1
i love this app but i was forced to actually go to the bank and deposit a check today because the app crashed when i tried to open it ill change my review when it works again,0
its disappointing that this feature hasnt worked for me the other features are ok,1
i agree with recent reviews since last update something went terribly wrong it use to work flawlessly now the deposit via camera option is worthless fix the bug please this app was perfect ,0
loved this app and the quick deposit feature it worked very well until this week when it now crashes my g phone every time after taking check photos please fix this very disappointing,1
if they would fix it then id give it five lately it gives me an error message that it cant bring up my detailed account information very frustrating,1
i am able to do most of what i need to do without using the computer,0
my friend had once logged in into his account from my iphone and even if i am logged off from his account and even mine i receive his + mine account details as notificationalert on daily basisthis is a huge bug its hard to trust this app,0
one of the main reasons i downloaded this app was to be able to make my car payment on my phone but it wont let me use my connected checking account so its pretty useless to me please fix this,1
i use this app frequently and id love to see an update with ability to report a card loststolen for an account you select amp request a new card  ability to set up a reoccurring payment or editadjust reoccurring payments a link to take me to the website still logged in,1
alert notifications no longer clear on exit or on opening the app stays open even when you hit the home key and when you come back in your account info is very visible thats not cool at all,0
its convenient and fast i can get my account information at anytime,1
this app was working fine for the last  months up until late march of this year when i try to check my account transactions the app chrashes chase needs to take care of this issue asap and its not my phone i have the iphone s,0
great app  only drawback is the  daily limit and  monthly limit on quick deposit  chase need to increase this amount or its useless to me,0
its not letting me pay my bills it keeps the number pad up when i push next fix it now,0
first off this app doesnt function before am eastern time for me second the deposit check works some of the timeamp third the alerts dont work i have it set to alert when a deposit greater then  and it never works horrible app,0
ive been trying to log in and it wont let me it tells me that my user name is not correct and and after i try again and again it said that it cannot connect to the server to try later please fix this,1
only way i pay my bills never had any issues ,0
great for on the go bill payments and balancing credit cards,0
i can log in and see my balance but i cant do anything else it is constantly crashing since the last update this app is unusable i am switching to simple,0
all it needs is the screen size for the iphone ,0
ever since the update the chase mobile app will not let me log in at all to view my accountit keeps telling me session timed out after i put my password i  very disappointed cuz i use to use this app everyday and now i cantand i have an iphone s,0
new iphone  doesnt work with it says timed out chase look at the number of crappy reviews you have received in the last few days and pull your head out of your arse and fix your app billions of dollars and you cans fix a little coding issues pfft,0
i used to be able to use this app and the mobile site about two months ago it stopped working i can now only check my accounts via a computer its crap and super frustrating please fix,0
i wish i could transfer to my external accounts on the app like i can on the website i would give this app  stars but it could give more information or show trends like competitor apps,0
the app is great for paying my credit bills but the fact that i cant access my loans account through the app is a big inconvenience,0
just like so many recent reviews the app worked great until i updated my operating system havent been able to log in for a month now tech support has no fix for those with iphone g any ideas why yours works,1
it doesnt work at all after i updated the app wont load at all its been about four days and i havent been able to view my accounts with my mobile device i hope its fixed soon,1
times out with wifi tried turning wifi off as listed in the above review and it connects with g all my  other bank accounts work whats up chase  called to report and they know its a problem no  way to run a bank,0
extremely dissappointed that now this app will work for ios  and later what about those people who are still with iphone g they cant go beyond ios  can this app may tweak to work with ios  or can you come up with separate app for  please,0
i have never had any fraudulent activity in my bank account until i got this app my account was compromised and  fraud dept luckily shut my account down most people are not as lucky do not get this app unless u want ur account to be hijacked and defrauded bewarei believe it was the scan check process,0
app has stopped working since the last update just freezes on login screen fix asap i became a chase customer because of the great mobile app very disappointed two more weeks of this then im switching banks no joke get it together,0
this app was working perfectly for me until i updated it now i dont even know how much money is on my account because it keeps putting transactions then deleting them fix this please ,0
what happened to the chase app this is horrible it makes it so difficult on the eyes to read on a smart phone it feels like all the information is overpowering especially on the all white background please consider changing,0
this app doesnt work if you are using wifi this means i have to log on using cellular data the mobile site also doesnt work please fix,0
i love having my bank at my fingertips and depositing checks from home is such a timesaver,0
iphone s using g or g and wifi working just like it should,0
since the last update im unable to make a payment on my credit card the submit button appears to be disabled,0
monthly limit on deposits is lame get paid weekly and can only deposits  checks a month and have to go into a branch to deposit the other ,1
the last release shows all my accounts at  which is definitely not the case i have s with latest firmware  you need to breakfix this right away i depend on the mobile version a lot due to travel,1
the app is not better than the website it was nice to have a shortcut straight to the login screen but this is the second mandatory upgrade that hasnt made any improvement next time i will just delete app,0
the topdown control of the mobile banking is not user friendly it requires one to update the app whenever the fat cat bosses decide never gives user a grace period before updating also clearing the alerts takes like  clicks way too deep,0
i rarely use this app anymore as every time that i open it i am unable to use it until i perform an update  it defeats the point of having a mobile app if it takes longer than turning on the computer,0
when trying to log in it takes quite a while and sometimes it wont even let me do anything,0
i am unable to pay my bill the button that i should be able to click to continue is not highlighted and will not lets move forward with my payment,0
after the st transaction it wont load again just keeps trying to load but wont i have had to delete this app amp download again a dozen times now kinda defeats the purpose of being convenient doesnt it,1
good app but i havent been able to deposit my last two checks please fix it i live kinda far from my bank and its a hassle to drive there every week,1
worked for me and clean interface,1
the app is ok but i feel i have to update it every couple of months and thats annoying,1
i specifically got this app so i could take a pic of my checks and deposit them but i dont have that option after pointless customers service rep and  updates i still dont even have the button to so it why,1
i cant deposit my paycheck until you fix this app so it doesnt close as soon as i take a picture of my check i dont live anywhere near a chase branch so this is my only option to get paid fix it now ive been trying for  days,0
a pop up window in the app telling me of a new feature blocks the submit bottom on my ipod when paying a bill very annoying have to hit the tiniest spot to get it to work hit it wrong and the pop up box opens ugh,1
every time i try to deposit a check after the second photo the app shuts down this app will not let me make deposits with checks please fix this,1
when i try to take a picture of my check for an online deposit it closes the app and sends be back to my home screen please fix soon,1

great app i wish you could chance the font once you log in,0
easy to navigate easy to understand and utilize,0
i would recommend this app to chase users,0
love this app easy to navigate and obtain balance information quickly,0
always says the picture is too blurry even bought a new iphone but same thing pictures are clear as a bell whats the point of having a feature that doesnt work,0
crashes instantly i used to use this app all the time but now i have to load the chase website from safari inconvenient and annoying this is whats convincing me to finally move all my money away from chase finally,0
great app i can check my balance and pay people right from the appstill needs to be updated for iphone  and touch id login support,0
its not optimized for iphone  plus works fine but not exactly updated as it states in most recent update,0
i dont see a difference for the iphone  the screen resolution is still huge alongside the keyboard it is not optimized for the larger screen sizes it would be nice to integrate the touch id for password input,0
this app used to be lightning fast however over the past couple updates it has been extremely slow,0
would be good if you can set on and off alert times bank of america allows you to turn off alerts between certain hours,1
what a terrible bug filled mess totally unable to use the deposit feature because the ui will not let you select the use or retake buttons the overall ui is poorly designed and hard to navigate total mess,0
ive used this app for ages with no problems since the last update i cant deposit checks so i should not be held responsible if my account gets overdrawn as i was relying on this working as it always used to please fix,1
the app works fine except for the quick deposit which is really the only reason i use the app would give  stars if this important feature worked ___,0
like the others since the last update i cant use the quick check deposit feature after taking the picture the use and retake buttons wont work please fix this as i dont live near any branches,0
you can no longer deposit checks with this app just like the other reviewers you cannot select the use button to select the check image this is with an iphone s,1
app used to crash when you uploaded deposited checks fixed now you cannot even take a picturedoes anyone quality check before pushing new versions of this app,1
since the last update i cant make a mobile deposit because the camera blacks out preventing any deposit photos making the feature inoperable is there a setting that i need to enable  please help,0
can we go back before the update every time i use this app i receive an email about how my phone isnt recognized trying to go back after going through some of the menus the app will not allow me to go back fix this app please,1
i like the app it does what i need and is easy to navigate would like it very much if they added touch id capability,1
ive always loved the chase app but the latest version update is horrible i have a notification that wont go away no matter what i do and every time i log into the app i get an email saying ive changed account settings please fix,0
love that i can now view statements straight from the app,1
i loved this app until the update now i get a black screen when i want to take a picture of a check so the mobile deposit function doesnt work any more i tried deleting the app and downloading again that didnt work,1
i dont like my statements with my account number and all my information right there for anyone to find on my phone its not that hard for someone to get passwords and get into your phone i hate the new app up grade and for that this app gets a big fat zero,1
previously had an iphone s then upgraded to  + and now i cant see my account preview swiping to the right _,1
great app reliable convenient i like recently added preview feature,1
far too frequent updates i do not use the app that often but every time i do an update is required if it takes a  minute process every time i want to use the app whats the point mobile website is fine,1
it gets the job done its pretty decent but seriously capital one has swipe login and other financial apps have fingerprint login come on just implement one or the other,1
its a great app but it has limited availability on sunday so you cant view how much you have an your account but transfers and checking the account works great,1
its a fantastic app you guys need to make it touch id compatible instead of always taking too much time to put in an annoying password please take it in consideration also the app needs an ios iphone  update the keyboard and layout needs to be optimized,1
i love that i can swipe and see my balances without logging in super convenient,1
quick pay transfer money balance preview and now id touch login good enough for me,1
this is a great app has everything you need to get done what you have to on the fly,1

great app to make sure ones finances are a click away,0
makes banking so easy i love everything i can do,1
about twice a week i try to log on to the app and it gives me a message saying it is temporarily unavailable it is very frustrating and even though chase is a great bank i wouldnt recommend this app at all,1
checking your balance and transferring money,1
constant updates more storage and app decides intermittently when you can deposit and to which account there are much better banking apps out there,1
i have had to update twice this week just to view my balance easier to use mobile web than the app at this point,1
ive heard stories about banks being behind the technological  ball but this takes the cake the fact that i have about an  confidence rate of even being allowed to login is where ill start and stop this review,1
whats the point of even using fingerprint authentication when i have to put in my password two seconds later to make a paymentvery bad alert system hidden away through numerous menus,1
honestly im glad you guys update your app so much but seriously no other app demands you to do an update before continuing,1
worst app ever makes you change your password every time you use it when you try a new password it wont accept it no matter what you put billion dollar bank and they cant even make a useful app,1
i love this app it makes my financial life easier so easy to login to and use,1
no isssues consistently works ive never had issues with it,1
with touch id its a must to have  everything at your fingertips  surprised its for free,1

keep working at it,1
that is very well designed and quite convenient i love its easeofuse,1
couldnt get the stars to work in my last review   stars,1
convenient new updates work well for me nice design,1
not horrible but needs work on user friendliness developers need to test it on every day users and fine tune it,1
theres more features i havent even got to yetlove it,1
never hit any problem,1
i use touch id on most other apps and this app needs it as well other than that the app is serviceable wont win any awards for creativeness,1

gives me accessibility to banking   easy to navigate efficient,0
love this app most of the time very accurate with push alerts love the preview option,1
loads quickly and easy to navigate,1
your check deposit functionality is poor you should look at the bank of america app its fantastic automatically takes a photo of the checks has half the number of steps and  takes one third the time to make a deposit half the time it says that the photo of the check is not acceptable and processes is frustratingly inconsistent with many times and being unable to complete a deposit,1
does everything i need it to do,0
does all you want and then some missing one star because there is no touch id please give us a touch id chase,1
awesome app for credit card can see balances activity and can,1
this app does all youll want from a bank,1
great app wish the points were more easily viewable,1
every single time the app updates or i decline to review the app i get the re enable touch id in settings and then too many log in attempts please reset your account  every single time ive reset my password at least  times in the past month and its a pain,1
always works has the features i need,1
very functional and easy to use,1
wish i didnt have to put my password in for some functions,1
the vast majority of the time i try to login i get a message stating the app is temporarily down i have to go to the actually site to view my account info basically this app was a waste of space,1
the app is very simple and straightforward and does everything that i need to do,1
does everything an atm offers you except for cash withdrawals lol,1
just the right app for mobile banking needs,1
get with the program chase this is the only app where i cant use fingerprint id,1
cant let them know youre traveling over seas with the app,1

touch id just stops working then it makes you go through the long process of resetting your password  this is now the th this has happened  fix this  usaa never has this problem going to switch back,1
i like it how i can deposit my check on this app very convenient,1
i would give this app  stars if they bring back the fingerprint log in i hate typing in my password each time i log in its annoying i missed the fingerprint,1
great app always works able to do a lot with it,1
the previous version of the app worked fine on my ios  device but now it refused to run and asks to get the new version which does not support ios lower than  thus i cant download it rendering the app useless just stupid,1
does everything you want in a banking app keep up the good work,1
chase is pretty good the app is awesome very useful i havent had many problems at all,1
it is a great app as a handicapped client it helps me with transactions in a very comprehensive way thank you,1
have no trouble using app can keep up to date on the fly thanks,0
this app has come along way over the years its bulletproof,1
i would be really nice if you could add a button on the login screen to choose to login with touch id so that i wouldnt have to close and reopen the app,1
makes banking with chase so much easier,0
does what i need never had a problem,1
everything i need,1
why are there ads now at the top of the log in screen awful,1
can access what i need quickly thats what matters the most timing and efficiently taking care of business with a tap,0
yep its ok it works good but in the last three days ive had to update my password three times im getting pretty sick of it,1
the app was great but with the addition of ads and messages that kick me off my touch screen and lock me out of my account i hate the iphone app  you need to fix it get all those messages off the sign in page,1
love the app,0
easy too use set up billing was fast and convenient,1
i cannot update my phone to the current os on iphone i am no longer able to use the app shame on you chase not all of your customers have the newest phones that your new app requires,1
life saving this app lets you see ur balance easyfast simple ,1
this is very helpful and i like the new update helps me out a lot,1
i have been happy with this app for seven months now suddenly it wont open for me,1
hate the newest updates have to wrestle with the website and apps if i forget and use a password manager or copyandpaste to populate the password field i shouldnt have to wrestle with my bank so were taking our banking elsewhere asap,1
very accurate and always available,1
i like that it tracks ill of my accounts on one site thanks,1
app is actually made insecure because of the overly secure way they make you change passwords results in reverting to analog to remember the weekly passwords which compromises security poor humanmachine interaction,1
the app works great could not ask for easier use,1
this app is the best sometimes i see things happening while i am doing them i love it,0

i love this app  with this app there is no excuse for late paymentst weidnerspring texas,1
every time i have to make a mobile deposit i have to delete and download the app otherwise it will come up with excuses as of why it was not able to deposit the check,1
great very convenient and easy access to my account,0
the app forces me to type in my password too often when i already took the time to set up and use my thumbprint to access the system too disruptive of a ux failure,1
i can check my accounts without having to go to an atm,1
switched to chase recently they are wonderful,1
mobile deposit doesnt work asks me to manually enter routing numbers but doesnt give me the controls to input them seems like the hi is missing a hit state to invoke the controls app is pretty useless without deposits,1
good way for me to see my balances and what i pay,1
the chase banking app is great i havent had any problems with it,1
can see more detail amp more concise  esp cleared checks  nice job,1
never done me wrong and i like the new finger touch feature,1
since recent update print is too small for those who are visually impaired to use no way to use old version of app forced to update print microscopic too small should be option to enhance visuals within app settings,1
i give it a  because i hate being forced to update the app in order to continue using it,1

help me a lot in my time for payment and fast deposit,1
this app works perfectly and is totally convenient,1
im updating my review bc chase has made some nice improvements fingerprint authentication and the app is much more intuitive nice,0
no real issues using the app but it could be better in terms of intuitiveness and simplicity,0
i love the latest version this is a great mobile app,0
great app depositing checks keeps getting easier makings banking simpler,0
i use the mobile app from wells fargo and bank of america but chase app is by far the best,1
excellent user interface and functionality,1
i am a long time bofa mobile app user particularly for depositing checks this app does not compare well  little automation in the photo taking flow of the steps slow performance suggest chase looks at their competitors app and make some improvements,1
i like this app as its very easy to use,1
i love this app it is very convenient for my usage,1
mobile deposits are hit or miss  which makes the technology lose its value if you still need to visit a branch or atm to deposit a check,0
not happy with the recent change i have to go to see all transactions before i see a pending total too many steps show total due and pending total on the same page please,1
its okay i mean it allows you to transfer money but its limited deposits dont show it allows you to read messages but doesnt let you compose thats odd crashes a lot,1
every now and then i get an alert from the app and wheni login and click on the alert tab there is nothing in it and then the alert disappears very annoying,1
the app does what its suppose too its clear and easy to use i have no comments as of yet,1
i like the quick almost instantly posting of transactions,1
great mobile service ,1
does what i need it to do never any problems with it,1
good app upgrades and small changes make it much more user friendly,1

extremely easy and convenient to use on the go,1
easy to use with nice features for iphone like touchid login,1
no issues im able to see my balance and make payments at any time,1
this app is great for depositing checks and general inquiries i wish it had more search capabilities on transactions,1
touch id for banking great knocking off one star for constantly asking to rate app even though ive already reviewed it another star gone for persistence in asking for reviews,1
never glitches very intuitive and easy to use,1
this app takes care of all my banking needs  love it,0
simple to use and has the features i need,0
i have had no issues with this app does all i need it to do amp more,1
i like that you have the option to sign in with your fingerprint,1
i love this app its very user friendly and makes my life easy,0
works every time no issues but need fingerprint scanner for easy log in,1
better than most,1
love this app so easy to do my banking on my phone,1
chase mobile is great much better than the bank of america app,1
loading screens take long interface needs improvement needs more options,1
this application is nothing more than a bookmark and a cookie to remember your account login this application is just a web view of their iphone optimized website,0
the user interface is the same as using it on safari  i guess its just a little convenient,0
beautiful user interface cool blues very easy to use with all your banking info at your fingertipswhat is wells fargowachovia waiting for,0
as chase is a really good bank i expected a lot more from their app its nothing different than going to their mobile website a waste of an app please change the interface,1
its so easy to use i love this app no more mailing payments i can just do it with a few clicks ,0
just wish i could view my leisure reward points,0
perfect except for getting directions to a atm always  or  blocks off my current location,1
works great no issues glad i switched to chase,1
this app is great i love the quick deposit feature saves a lot of time,0
i like the app but every time i go to transfer between accounts it says i have no eligible accounts i set up an external account and activated it and i see it on the website but it doesnt work in the app bums me out ,1
i have tried to deposit checks now several times it never works or tells me to try again later its unusable,1
i have only been able to use this app  times since downloading it which was about  months ago  it always says temporarily unable to connect to chase banking  my suggestion is it is not worth the space it is taking up on my ipod,1
works as advertised  deposits work fine so long as the routing and account numbers arent disturbed by writing,0
the updates have yet to fix the issues i still have an inordinate amount of alerts that do not clear and sometimes shows i have  alerts other peoples alerts appear on my phone when im logged in please fix this,0
i was excited to use the check deposit feature but even though i have the latest update its not an available feature on my iphone   wft,0
good app helps me manage my bank account on the go and its simple and secure to use,0
convenient recommend for everyone,1
since the last update i keep getting a service unavailable popup from within the app i can only view one account once or transfer money once before the popup happens this makes the app unusable,1
no check deposit icon  it would be a lot better if i had that,1
does everything i want it to do love the push notifications its a great essential app to have,0
i didnt realize how good it was until i opened a wells fargo account and got their app  this is way ahead of wells fargo,0
everything worked great until about a month ago when quickdeposit stopped working this feature was very important for me since there are no chase atms near me,1
when i try logging in half the time it says my password is incorrect but its not also its been unable to connect to chase lately why,1
the alerts badge has always required too many taps to clear and now as others have said will not clear  very annoying,0
for ocd folks like me the alert notification number not going away after reading the alerts is a big problem outside of that i dont see any loss of features,0
fixed worth  stars again,1
i have never had a problem with anything its great to have,1
makes life a little bit easier,1
my app crashed the moment i try to select something once logged on i have an iphone  ios up to dateplease fixthis app has become useless to me,1
but now all it does is let me log on and it just crashes whenever i look through my transactions,1
so easy to use and manage my accounts with,0
ilike this better than other similar apps,0
i have a mortgage with chase and now that i have the app i am no longer able to pay my mortgage each month which i have been doing for the last couple of years on my phone iphone  its a total waste of time,1
this app was perfect until the latest software update please fix this asap the app will load properly if you are not on wifi you have to change it to g and use your data in order for the app to work correctly please fix asap,0
otherwise works fine,0
my favorite app why isnt it working makes life so much more managble,0
the screen size for is app hasnt been optimized for the iphone  yet its still a  and s size needs to be fixed please,1
i think this is the most easy to use,0
this app is totally awesome i use this not for a long time but im very satisfied about it,1
i have been using this app for over  months with no problems over the course of the past month it has timed out each time ive attempted to log in the lack of functionality has inspired me to write this review,0
has always worked great on my iphone  did the last update and now i can barely even log in let alone view my account information what happened,0
it hasnt given me any problems,0
app is worthless since iphone come on chase there are more then enough resources to fix thisfix it this was the highlight of your service you might as well be a third rate local bank with this app performance,1
does not work i use to deposit thru my mobile app and now it doesnt work my last deposit gave me an acceptance receipt but never went thru and i went overdrawn thanks but wont be using this feature again fix it,0
after receiving an email from chase to be sure to update my app by nov  i thought id finally be able to use the app again wrong updated and the app still doesnt work what is wrong can somebody please get this fixed,0
i have no issues at alliphone  user ,1
the app refuses to login the only way i can login is to delete the app and then install it this is highly inconvenient the app used to work perfectly before please release an update super soon,1
love this app but is a real pain that i have to turn off wifi every time i want to log in,0
if you have an alert the number is not showing in more and alert screens please fix it otherwise we wont be knowing which one is having message in more screen thanks,1
this app has never once opened on my iphone it spins then times out  i used it every day on my droid  for a company of this size and reputation one would think they could do something as simple as create a working app  cant it be fixed  come on,0
ok games evolve and might need newer os but i dont have the money to buy a new ipod touch or get an iphone and now the old app doesnt work anymore and i cannot get the new app in other words no customers in mind thats what chase stands for nowadays money is more important well proved,0
works most of the time sometimes it takes forever,1
this is the th month in a row i still havent been able to make deposits from the app you guys sent the update fixing the bugs in hope this problem was fixedit is not and is a huge inconvenience,0
when the app actually lets me log in its great but about  of the time it just spins and spins an never logs me in but what can you expect the service on the app is on par with the service at a regular brick and mortar location,0
has everything i need to do on my phone,0
everything works great for me stable with a good interface,0
i can no longer pay my chase cc the next button stays disabled even though all required info is there overall this app suffers from poor usability and should be avoided,0
i like it except for the fact that there is maintenance every weekend and its annoying wondering why that cant happen in the middle of the night,0
seems like when i need to check my accnt the most it never lets me log on it gets stuck in the login page and i try closing the app and reopening the iphone app def needs improvement,0
i have never been able to deposit a check which is one of the main reasons i got a smart phone it always crashes when i click submit ive submitted help requests and they have never been returnedanswered,1
easy to use quickpay is great transferring money is easy and check deposits are awesome,0
when i access this app via lastpass it wont let me deposit checks using my iphone ssupport says that is intentional amp to just log in manually without lastpassreally      should i also ignore the fact that the wheel was inventedbut for some reason i can log in with lastpass on my desktop computerso if you log into your chase mobile using a password manager amp you can no longer deposit checks with it  chase does know about it  they just wont do anything about it,1
whenever i try to pay my bill the continue button wont work extremely frustrating has gone unfixed for months cant you see all the  star reviews chase no desire to improve the app,1
after the last update i havent been able to log in a notification keeps popping up saying that it cant process my request at this time,1
possible one of the worst apps i have ever downloaded seriously its totally useless unless u wanna see how much u owe doesnt allow u to make an acct or really use your acct shame on you chase stop wasting my money and use it toward somethings useful like a user friendly app,1
since the new update i can rarely deposit a check using it the ap closes itself almost every time i try to take a photo of the check its very frustrating,1
app crashes every time you make a deposit it is a regression as it used to work before a recent update chase knows about it but has yet to fix it theyre too busy covering up madoff scandals and or crashing the economy,1
seriously its inexcusable that every time i try to deposit a check the app shuts down how do you not have this fixed as others say its the primary reason i use the app and  of the time it doesnt work garbage,1
great new ui makes it a pleasant experience to use each time,1
i want to see my money  not flowers and trees  this new visual interface makes my head hurt  show me the money  dont make me scroll through your big fonts and background pictures  big step backward with this update,1
very impressive ui i am love in it i think its the best bank application until now,1
since the update and redesign the app does not show my account balances all i ever see is na goes for all checking and savings please fix this,1
very easy to use and the new update makes it look great  very functional and very rarely does it not work,1

looks great easy to use great mobile functionality,1
i like the new layout but i wish i could or knew how to change the image on the log in screen,0
when you get down in the alerts menu it doesnt take you to the account that has the alert just the first one in your list if you get more than one alert it is a guessing game basic day one uxui stuff,1
finally a version that doesnt have bugs better than the bank of america app by far,1
great app makes it easy for me to manage my money love the deposit option,1
this is the best app its so easy to use an even easier to set up thanks chase,1
i love this app  very welcoming design and easy to review the account but it got slower since they got a new look,1

this app is perfect for me since i hate waiting in line at the bank such a time saver,1
what happened to the running balance  it looks pretty now but is a bit harder for me to read i can deal with the colors if the running balance was returned,1

such a time saver i dont know why i havent used quick deposit sooner,1
da bomb shows exactly what i have and gives easy accessit is easy to use,0
the chase app is such a great app easy to navigate through has come in handy numerous times,0
great app no problems would highly recommend,0
i wish all the others were this userfriendly,0
the team is very quick at fixing bugs,0
i dont mind if your programmers need to keep busy with new uis but when you hit the menu button in the top left the app really shouldnt lock up maybe  or  programmers could be assigned to testing instead of designing unnecessary ui changes,1
this latest release is buggy after several attemps to update tha application starts but stays blue screen and crashes i had to load previous version for it to work again,0
the app was great before ios  now i cant take pictures of my check and deposit i would like this fixed asap your making my life difficult to do anything,0
updated today and still not supported by the iphone  even though it says it does,0
the use and retake buttons do not work when trying to deposit checks i am on an iphone s ios  didnt have this problem a few weeks ago when depositing otherwise great app please fix,1
app will not allow me to take pictures of my checks the screen is black and you cannot even see the check at all therefore not able to be deposited it please fix as soon as possible the app is not any good without it need to update for iphone  plus please as soon as possible,1
an app is only good when the functions work when attempting to deposit a check the use button stopped working please fix this,0
i use this app for  things to check my balance and deposit checks does someone wanna tell me why cant i deposit my checks this is stupid and is frustrating why is the option there if i cant use it i hate it,0
as stated before you can no longer use the camera part of the app because the use doesnt work all started after last ios update,0
i like it a lot its better then the last bank i used mobil app,0
just like other reviews  the deposit function doesnt work  the use button doesnt work  how disappointing  features that made this app convenient for banking now make it a headache,0
just like many other reviews mention the check deposit use button no longer works but i know this will never be read so im not sure why im wasting my time,0
i have called the online support and reported that this app needs update until now no updates its been almost  months now it wont let you use the picture taken it gets stuck in there,0
the fingerprint is a much more secure way to login to important app such as banking apps please add support for fingerprint to login into chase mobile appthx,1
i love chase but im not so fond of the app i would love to see a quick log on and pending deposit features,0
i only have chase quickpay i searched the app store for quickpay and found this app this app says cannot display your account information on a mobile device please log into a computer completely and utterly worthless,0
notifications dont cancel out when you sign in which is annoying i get email and text notifications i dont need to go into the app every day to see them please fix,1
the app is fine but not convenient  i mainly use it to pay the bill  stinks that the app is unusable until you get updates about every other month,1
its pretty pathetic that this app still doesnt have touchid support its also not optimized for iphone  yet so everything looks a little too big disappointing considering how big chase bank is,1
i have a iphone gs and it works great ive never fell into the new phone every year trend those that want a new toy thats fine but punishing those that keep older phone is just not right thanks to the recent update the chase app became useless and therefore deleted,1
the only reason why i download mobile app is to deposit check however it keeps telling me that my picture is not clear enough while it actually is very clear very disappointed,1
this app started out being quite a decent banking app but since the latest updates it is constantly so buggy arcanely userunfriendly and unreliable that it makes me think they dont actually want people to use this app for banking,1
i would love for this app to add the touch id feature but overall its great,1
nicely designed app but desperately needs touchid  support to log in its immensely annoying having to manually enter a password every time you want to use the app whats taking so long to add this feature,1
the latest update makes it so i cant see my available credit,1
i wish that we could view secured emails on the app or mobile site,1
i really like this app however i would love to view checks through this application,1
i can do almost everything i need to do with this app,0
i like the information that is available and all of the options,1
touch id  finally able to use it for quick signin on this app thank you,1
app is so useful to quickly check the balance and pay bills,1
now it is the perfect banking app glad i made the switch to chase,1
chase has a perfect flawless app that makes banking with them easy,1
no complaints at all and love that touch id was added,1
great and easy to use,1
everything you need for your financial needs,1
i need to change my password every time i want to use this stupid app and the guidelines for the password doesnt make sense all the passwords that i use are wrong dont have the time to make new passwords every time i want to see my account really no sense,1
this app is so easy to use and now with touch id its even better,1
app makes it very easy to be a chase customer well done,1
best banking app on the market hands down tell everyone else to go home,1
i love the app but i wish they had cleared check images also that would make it  perfect,1
that about sums it up it is an overall great app does everything i want it to do,1
great app for chase wouldnt use any other,1
the touch login is a very nice feature,1
i absolutely love chase the app is great and the employees are very helpful i have to say the touch id is awesome thank you chase,1
use it all the time and it works perfectly,1
thanks guys  was waiting since the day i bought my iphone s,1
very helpful app and its easy to use no complaints here,1
very convenient and easy to use,1
easy to use in all sense,1
this app is very flexible and provides almost  of the capabilities of the online version live it love it,1
i like being able to use touch id i do not like chase suddenly not working in my mint app i hope chase will reconsider,1
finally adding the touchid was all this app needed love chase they do no wrong in my book,1
defenatly recommend this app to everyone really easy to use,1
love this app i can pay my bill off little by little every time i get ,1
i love it easy to use and is improving everytime i update it  just worth it ,1
its quite clear that the devs that wrote this app actually use it good job fellas,1
great app convenient and pretty much a life saver for someone who is on the road a lot,1
i really like the app its been very helpful and it helps me really manage my money,1
all around outstanding app cant say anything else then its a must have and works great and secure like fort knox,1

this app is of no use anymore as i havent been able to login in for over a month  i always have to go to the website instead and the website doesnt do quick deposits,1
they keep requiring an update and each update makes it worse  so many issues  very difficult to deposit checks  chase needs to fire their app developers and hire a new team,1
every time i go to log in there is another required update too many there is nothing quick about this app,1
whatever happened with the latest update touch id seems to have disappeared and now i can only login with my password bummed,1

i use it all the time especially good for bill paying on my ipad,1
even if only for quickpay its a good app,1

i use this app all the time every time so easy and never fails,1
this app has ate my last two mobile deposits and i had to contact their customer service in a lengthy process to get the issue resolved dont remote deposit checks with this app,1
it very organized,0
i like the app but i cant seem to read the entire memos ive written in the quickpay feature,1
the app looks exactly like the website one would think that one of the worlds most powerful banking corporations could create a well formatted and functional app,0
chase should have aquired wamus web designers along with the rest this app and chases website stinks like s web browsing this app may get the job done but it looks terrible as a wamu customer im going to miss the wamu web interface maybe its time to switch banks,0
this use to be my favorite app till i upgraded to  please fix this already i want to pay my bills through here like i use to,0
i was really impressed with the new update man before it was kinda ghetto but now its really awesome,0
does everything i need it too,1
way to go chase i love the deposit feature,1
so easy can always check my balance in the go,1
the system flatout misread my correctlyentered password and thus stymied my authentication x and threw me into a needless stoopidloop of usernames passwords and digit codesif finally did admit i was entering the characters correctly and let me in i hope this is not a sign of malfunctionality to come,0
this app is great electronic check deposit is easy to use and a really cool feature,1
please tell me why i can photo the check but cannot access the actual deposit part of this app im disabled so getting to the bank can be a problem i thought this would actually help those like me,1
deposit feature with your camera will not work i have tried  times with  different checks ridiculous they add a feature months ago and it still doesnt work f off chase,1
with a little market research or common sense these geniuses would realize that owners of the iphone  would have checks totaling more than  to deposit  if you have that limit make this application for feature phones aka dumbphones on tmobile fail,1
the app keeps crashing and wont let me deposit checks it was working fine all these months and in the last few weeks it wont let me deposit checks anymore,1
does all that you need to do on the go never crashes fantastic app,1
works great much better than bank of americas app,1
its beautiful i only wish you would add quick deposit for business banking please,1
the notification stay on the window the daily transaction views are terribleplease change that back overall used to be happy with the app this update is awful please modify it soon and revert back to the old ledger view,1
first  minute impressions very nice,0
highly recomendyour activity will show very quickly  a+ for this app,0
but i cant deposit my check i cant figure it out,0
the app as a whole works well but quick deposit rarely if ever works,0
needs to have a budget plan of some sort however it does its job and helps me keep on top of my finances,0
it works just like i hoped it would it is easy to use and a simplifies my banking,0
nice and easy to use hope i can view my credit card there too,1
stupid app has said i have  notifications in the more section its annoying fix it developer,1
i have and ipod touch g and i have the chase mobile app but it doest give me thw option to diposit a check via quickdeposit  i really need to deposit a check please update so i can deposit a check,0
great ap normally but there are too many errors lots of server errors and notifications are almost impossible to view from inside the ap needs more work i love quick deposit though,1
seems like the check deposit feature works about  of the time  please fix and this would be a great app,1
this update does not remove the number appearing next to the app even after i viewed my alerts ive tried everything and its still showing,1
every since the new update i cant log in at all it just load and i tried to reinstall it but that dont work either this needs to be fixed,1
now when i try to deposit my paycheck like i do every week in this app the dollar amount switches back to  after you type in the deposit amount please fix this its what made this app so amazing,1
deposited my payroll check writen from a chase account using the app  found out  hours later that the app makes it take a day or two to post would have taken the check in if i knew and had access to my paycheck right away,0
this app is pretty muchwhat i need get it,0
i would tap the app and it wouldnt open this doesnt happen to only this app but it still is frustrating i dont know what to do,0
im not sure if its because im running beta ios  on my iphone but it crashes any time i want to check activity or deposit a check and i need it badly im stuck out in iowa and they dont have chase and i need to deposit a check,0
everyone should have this app,1
this app has everything ive been looking for,0
ever since i updated to ios  i cant see the activity of my accounts i rely on this app and it needs to be ios  compatible,0
i had as much money as the pictures for the app,0
ill give  start if i can have the checking and savings balance from your app preview page by tomorrow,1
you guys have made plenty of updates however their have no updates to have the app match the iphone   inch screen please update that thank you,0
after update this app doesnt work hope they fix it fast need to see my transactions i called and they didnt know anything about it just said to reload app i did and of course nothing changed,0
app stop working when i upgraded my software to ios  just downloaded the new version as instructed by an email i received from chase and now i cant access my accounts at all this app needs to be fixed asap,1
what happened to this app it used to be great but for the past few months it stopped working all i get is loading screens and errors im not able to deposit checks anymore can someone please fix this,0
never had a problem with this app i love it  so easy to use,1
i rely on this and nobody seems to be able to make it work  when it finally does you go and update something and it crashes again for another  days  shame on you i t people  get this app working ,0
this app use to work perfectly but ever there was the dos attack on their servers have not been able to log in even after the update chase is blaming apple for the issue but that is just a bad excuse for their crappy app not working,0
this app only works on cell data it does not work when connected to wifi great when it works weird that it doesnt work over wifi,0
i think its easy to use i can deposit checks with my phone when i cant get to the bank transfer money its a cool app,0
i was only able to log in once  my wifi is off and its still not working  im a new customer to chase and this is just ridiculous no other bank has this problem,0
i never even rate apps thats how bad this one has been im sure it may work great on older version iphones but for a mobile banking app to be this unreliable is just horrible if only there was a way to hit rating of zero please oh please send a fix update soon,0
had this app forever and it works everytime,0
i would have given this app a  star rating a few weeks ago but it has suddenly stopped working i deleted it and reloaded it onto my phone and its still not working so disappointing as i was using it everyday,1
i have not been able to log in for a couple of days now something is wrong with the app please fix asap,0
i never can log in most of the timethe app keeps sending me the request timed out messages every time i try to log in i have actually stopped using the app all together and started just going online now,1
this app could be much better it tells me my balance due on my credit card but doesnt tell me when its due its set up in an odd way not very userfriendly,0
now i dont have to go to branch to deposit checks very convinient app but i still like to use computer to check balance amp activities with bigger screen the deposit function is not working now very disappointing,0
when i put in my log in information it just keeps loading and loading until the request finally just times out i can log in  out of  times on average thats pretty irritating,0
the recent update disabled the transfer and pay bill function  the previous worked great but this one is useless  when will there be a bug fix,0
chase mobile gave me a rude shock this morning showed me  balance on both my savings and checking accounts immediately grabbed my laptop to see the expected whats going on at chase  someone is sleeping while coding someone hires crappy devs for perks testers having fun time,0
check deposit is a joke no reason given for not being able to process the deposit other times the app cannot connect with their server but my laptop can,0
great appbut this not remembering the user id thing is annoying oh the quick deposit feature could use some attention as well,0
when i try to transfer money after i enter the amount the numbers stay there and i wont be able to process the transfer,1
awesome overall last update shuts down during remote deposits  real pain,1
good app but this basic feature is required fix thisi remember seeing this feature in last release but dont see that option to select  bad,0
i havent been able to use the deposit function for over a month i can take a picture of the check and then when i click submit it crashes every time please fix,0
apps keeps crashing when i take a picture to deposit a check this is the main reason why i got the app so frustrating,0
when trying to pay bills or transferring money the number pad stays open and you cant finish the transaction please fix it chase this is ridiculous that this is not fixed yet,0
i really only want to use this app for basic thingscheck my account and pay my bill i always seem to have problems paying my bill the continue button never works ugh,0
new version keeps showing past notifications until viewed on the app alerts,0
worked great for years no longer will log me on trying to pay my credit card  called chase and they are unaware of any problems hope they waive my late fees since mailing a check isnt going to make it in time,0
definitely convenient tho,1
using it on iphone  and works flawlessly all these bad reviews are probably users with iphone s,1
app refuses to let me take pictures to make deposits pressing the shutter button refocuses but doesnt actually take a picture this is under bright lighting and worked in previous versions,1
deposit check feature is awful input info take photos submit it erases all the info saying error  start over and repeat x later give up and walk to bank and deposit in person worthless,1
when i try to pay my chase freedom credit card bill this app wont let me strangely i used to be able to do it before the update for io,0
once again their latest update is bad try to make a mobile deposit and you get either an error message or itll just crash this feature is one of my favorites please fix it,0
the main reason i used this app was to deposit checks since updating to the current version on my s the focus goes in and out and i continuously receive an error saying the quality isnt clear enough,1
disappointed in giving this app a chance thinking it would make things easier stick to depositing directly to the bank,1
not sure what happened used to deposit checks with no problems now as i click camera button to take pic of front side of check the app closes and i go back to my home screen please fix,1
i really enjoy this app i cant get through my day to day without using this app,1
went from just an app to a great experience,1
the new update looks good however a lot of the function i used your app how need help after this update nice try i guess,1
love the pic of the bay area in the background it does turn green almost like a green screen on the deposit screen,1
takes like five minutes to load half the time doesnt even work very frustrating bring back the old chase app,1
i did the update for the new app and im disappointed it doesnt show current balance it delays  days if you have available funds or not and caused me to overdraft  times and chase tells me that they are not responsible you guys better fix your apo or im changing banks,1
chase app is clean well laid out info easy to find amp see a joy to use,1

works as expected,0
it takes a very long time to load and in the end says it cannot connect ive been trying to do this for the past hour extremely frustrating,1
this app is easy to navigate and very simple to use,1
i find chase mobile a good app that has satisfied all my banking needs,1
so easy to use and fast great upgrade,1
not a fan of this new chase app the old one was simpler and more usable the new version has too much visual clutter and feels cludgy to use wish i could downgrade,0
love the new update it has a better interface and very userfriendly,1
love this app i can check my balance and easily pay my bills,1
simple compact and user friendly,1
the picture takes away from the feel of the app always liked how the app looked and felt in the previous version this version feels unfinished somehow as stated in the title not feeling the theme,1
works great for checking balances and transferring ,1
better than the first version,1
i use it almost everyday to take care of all my banking,1
i had no problems at all,1
latest application update makes this application much worst   much less intuitive  not nearly as functional  very difficult to get to detailed transactions i still cant figure out how to see images of deposited checks and deposit slips   chase please go back to previous app,1
simple easy and profoundly convenient,1
convenient simple and it works,0
easy to use always helpful on the go,1
hello im new to the chase mobil app but so far im finding it very easy and innovative to use highly recommended,1
great app easy to use does everything i need with my banking activities,1
ive never had trouble with this app its very easy to use,0
this is a great app for watching your transactions,0
i couldnt ask for more from this app,0
i love this app simple and effective easy app to use and never fails to get the job done,0
love the app makes it easy to bank from your phone,0
not user friendly if it is not working most of the time paying a bill was so easy before now it is impossible   ugh we dont need to look cool  just give us a working app like before please please,0
simple to use and efficient,0
just what you need to check balances and confirm transactional activity,0
i use it daily for deposits transfers and account payments,0
worked well before but after an automatic update not so much when trying to update one payee was taken to a different one customer service tells me i have to reinstall we will see,0
when i open the app all i get is a blue screen for about  seconds and then it goes back to the home screen springboard disappointing when you really need to know the balance to make a financial decision,0
trying to deposit is absolutely impossible the picture is off backward show error but sent me an email of the deposit request but no acceptance email so it never got deposited  thanks god i didnt tear the check this update is bad,0
if i lived at the top of mount mckinley in the dead of winter with no way down  save leaping from the edge of a cliff it would still be easier to go to the bank to deposit a check than to use this app,0
i only use app to keep track of my balance and deposit checks lately quick deposit wont save the check image making this feature useless,0
latest update which was forced on you logs you out of your account when you switch between apps very annoying have to minimize app instead,1
i have this bank account only because it was easier but its only a hassle anymore confuses the deposit button for zoom when i take pictures of y checks very frustrating,1
depositing checks used to mostly work now its just a disaster and its been that way for well over a month how hard can it be to fix something that used to wor,0
i too was forced into upgrading and lost the ability to deposit checks via the app i can check balance and transfer money with laptop they bricked the one killer feature the app had ,0
design amp option  were improved but the function of deposit made error to read routing no always even though the routing no was correct,0
cant use mobile deposit anymore good for checking balances quickly,1
when the app prompts you to take a picture of the check it doesnt let you press the use button at all which renders the check deposit option useless,0
please fix this chasethis link doesnt work to get to the ultimate rewards for the chase credit cards linked to the online banking,0
i am unable to use my direct deposit in the s all of a sudden this is very inconvenient also would be nice to have a feature to search instead of scrolling through all the credits and debits,1
solid banking app love the quick pay feature touch id support would make a good app great,1
if chase is supporting apple pay they need an update that allows you to sign in with touch id,1
really stupid appwhy would it allow you to make transfers but doesnt even give you an option to check activity on your accounts cant check entries to your accountworst banking app ever,1
my gs app will no longer work it says i must upload an update and when i do it recycles to must update over and over again i guess im out of luck now unless i update my phone that isnt happening oh well so long,1
app needs to show correct balance at all times pending payments will post and then previous payments will seems to repostalso this app is not integrated for iphone  compatibility and touch idapp needs improvement,1
i like the app one of the better mobile banking apps  it would get  stars if it had touchid support,1
great functionality in the app but it needs touchid it requires you to login every time you open the app very frustrating when using a strong password makes me want to simplify my password,1
no way to view escrow statements even the mobile web site locks you in to a small aspect of functionality no way to use desk top version on the iphone  obviously their developers dont bank with chase not user centric in design,1
the app is alright looks decent but the interface could use some work its not very clear how to view transactions and it needs touchid support,1
great app if you bank with chase i strongly recommend getting this app,1
could use user customization options thumbs up,1
a spending report would make this app a  star,1
wonderfully executed implementation of touch id perhaps the best one i have seen among financial apps,1
app is pretty awesome it has everything covered and its very simple to use,1
i love the this app it is seriously the best mobile banking app out there i use it everyday,1
great redesign simple and easy to manage,1
it took a while but finally came out with touch id thanks,1
amazing everything weve asked for has been implemented and the app is flawless,1
i had citibank a while then came to chase when i got marriedmuch better,1
love chase bank and the app wont go anywhere else,1
simple easy does everything i need,1
if you have high expectations for this app prepare to be disappointed aside from paying bills i use mint  of the time,1
many useful features clean interface,1
does everything i need it to do it does not replace my need for a branch but it is a very useful accompaniment,1
use chase quick pay all the time great app,1
i love using this app so convenient and always up to date very dependable,1

even better now that touch id has been addedthumbs up,1
very simple and easy to use app i love all of the features,1

usless for anything but viewing your balance much easier to log on the website from your phone and do what you need to do waist of memory space on your phone,1
nothing exceptional  i had to authorize the touch id because i was having to change my password every time i logged in,1
piece of junk every time i go to deposit a check it thinks its the same check from a month previous why does it do this i end up driving to the bank just like i did six years ago what a waste of time,1

i like this app very useful in keeping track of my expenses and deposits,1
very detailed information available asap much needed for a busy lifestyle,0
bad user interface horrible user experience poor functionality the app requires too many clicks doesnt provide same information as a web version very clunky,1
every time this app updates it wants me to reenter my password and of course its always at an inconvenient time and place it does the basics but not much else so i really dont use it for much except checking balances and payments,1
gives all the info you need,1
this makes tracking and paying my bill simple and easy  but it keeps telling me ive made too many attempts to sign on  when ive only made one and i have to change my passwordagain ,1

need to be able to sign in with touch id  otherwise works well,1
i can do everything i want or need to do with no stress or hassle excellent app,1

having a similar problem others are having using touch id then more and more often it says i have to reset my password because of too many log in attempts and touch id goes inoperable please fix this,1

this app is use to be user friendly  now it seems like every time i go to log in there have been too many attempts and i need to change my password i have to change it every two days very upsetting,1
difficult to read text when doing quick pay or paying bills light grey  letters on white background is hard to read please fix,1
these ads while logged in are annoying i will close my account and switch to another bank if they continue,0
i like it  some have removed thumb print but happily this one still employs it,1
does what it is supposed to adequately frequent update requirements that prevent me from checking my balance are annoying,1
easy to use does what its supposed to very user friendly,1
easy to understandsimple thanks chase,1
very well optimized,1
i love the app but would love fingerprint log on to make it even more of a time saver,1
complete and easy,1
used to be able to see your credit score its a bummer thats not there,1
this app constantly locks me out of my account and i have to create new passwords much too often its time consuming and defeats the purpose of downloading the app to begin with id be better off using their mobile site fix this please,1
i have no complaints it works for me all the time,0
i like money this app is fantastic in that way,1
i love the app it make is so easy to keep my account up to date ,1

excellent app user friendly and very intuitive,1

that is all,1
are used to be able to scroll back as far as i wanted to and get a great report of money coming into and leaving my accountnow i am forced to download these crappy pdfs  which are trapped up in months this is going to make doing taxes a nightmare,0
great way to check balances and manage your finances,0
love the function of the mobile app,0
i enjoy using this app to me it is the best one on my iphone keep up the good work chase,1
this software does not read checks well the bank of america automatically takes the picture when its in focus other than that the app works fine,1
not as robust as website but itll do as a mobile app,1
this app is  reliable and does everything i need it to do,1
easy to use and doesnt freeze up,1
chase gets an  star rating for this fast and easy app kudos to chase,1
i used to love this app it makes depositing checks transfers money and etc easier whatever update they had recently completely ruined the app and now i cant upload any checks to deposit its such a joke,1
the new app is beautifully designed and i actually like the touch id feature it works well for all my needs too the only issue is their marketing banners are really annoying,1
i dont understand how they can release such trash you would think that they would at least do some beta testing instead of having consumers be frustrated by a constantly crashing pos,0
the app works ok for me but its still hard to determine actual charge deduction dates and actual balance,1
i love the app i can view statements make depositsi dont remember what i did before,1
for what it is it works probably more like a amp star which i dont know how to choose if you can,1
works fine for me,1
it was a great app until now,1
less pop ops that make you leave the app would be a plus,1
this app makes my banking so much easier,1
it works well and has a great user interface,1
 of the time photo of check deposits on smart phone doesnt work frustrating,1
amazing on time without delays status and  excellent app rewards,1

very user friendly,1
ive really grown to like this app a lot its easy to transfer money actually its easy to use period,1
love chase online banking easy convenient time saving,1
pretty easy to use fingerprint signin sometimes turns offthats frustrating,0
it does what i needed to do and i dont need anything else i think its a good app,1
does everything flawlessly very easy to use,1
love the new update would be awesome if you could name your accounts,1
constant issues depositing checks never had these kinds of problems with my old much smaller bank,1
enjoy the time it saves and how convenient it is to use,0
this is a great app but has a little trouble every time that has an update the touch id is deleted,0
its worked great for me  no more need win a computer to bank,1
i dont know what i would do without my chase bank app,1
were temporarily unable to connect to chase please try again later thanks for your patience this error message appears all the time but not with my other banking accounts very frustrating,1
i love this mobile chase app it does what i need when i need it all the time best app ever,0
great app very professional better then all the other banks i have tried very easy to use,1
this is a great app although i dont love asking to review it every other day,1
use it daily it works they update it it still works,1
after the latest update the remote deposit is very glitchy and slow used to work flawlessly previously,1
i dont think its too much too ask to be able to check my balance at my convenience but this app rarely lets me login even when i try again later i will be switching banks soon chaseappfail,1
easy to use morning noon or night it lets me know that my money is right,1
easy interface intuitive design works for me ,1
love the app first time using it and its very easy to get used to,1
for me one of the most important items in apps is the ability to use touch id  with the recent update touch id shuts off frequently  no good no good at all,1
great for the kids to get the best of all of your friends,0
great mobile banking app,1
i can do everything i need to do with this app,0
complete banking on my phone  great ,1
easy to use and always accurate,1
love depositing checks no trips to bank,1
this is an excellent application easy to use and the updates are phenomenal,0
love it no complaints here makes budgeting easier,0
as a first time user it wanted to default to paperless statements when i wanted to see transactions,1
please make available features like apple watch support and ipad onetouch login i had bank of america app and they had these long time ago thanks,1
i really love this app makes banking and managing cards so much easier,1
this app would be good but they keep changing it every month and you are forced to do the update or you cant use it  not to mention every update you have to relearn how to navigate the page ,1
thanks for making it easy for me to keep track of my finances,1
easy way to control your money,1
newest update caused the app to regularly log me out citing changes in my login so that i have to reenable touch id everyday lest it doesnt work,1
too many updates that add nothing but force you to come up with a completely new password  only app that works on only one view of the ipad,1
it can no longer accept checks imaged with iphone   or iphone plus any moreit also hangs and crashes for no reason if you do more that read your accounts,1
this app is great very user friendly and all my account activity at my finger tips great job designing it ,1
nice chase is the best bank never had a problem,1

this is such a simple fast convenient app built for the consumer i love having my chase app,0
i love this chase app dont know what would i do without it so easy to use,0
i love this app i can do all my banking right off my phone,1
half the time during login i get a message saying it doesnt recognize my phone i have been using this exact phone for  years,1
my first experience was great the easy features and security of this app has me worry free,0
i love this app so fast and easy to do everything,0
its a great app  u can see your balance debt credit pay it its great,1
easy to use  keeps my bank at easy access  love it,1
this app works a described the atm locator is useful if you are in a city other than your home but works great,1
this is a very disappointing app as others have said its basically a bookmark to the poorly thought out and weak mobile website its a start but needs lots of workpolish to be a real app,1
this banking application is nothing more than a shortcut to their mobile html site you can get there by just opening safari yourself i expected more native functionality and was very dissapointed with the lack of features in this app,1
i been waiting on this app  a long time this do everything that its suppose  do amp morethankyou chase amp thankyou apple,1
this is a good app however the features are limited,1
horrible app that only serves as a web portal basically requires device verification every time you try to log in chase look at other banking apps as well as apps like mint to see what works and what doesnt because this does not work,0
i have tried this app multiple times amp have always gotten a cannot connect to chase error seems others have this issue as well i just use the chase mobile website for now,0
looks like a very useful little app one massive problem though doesnt work with wamu i hope chase brings this all together as wamu users dont have an iphone app for banking,1
is everyone using the same app as me love it works fast tells me what i need to know,1
nice upgrade chase  app is  times better now thumbs up ,1
all banks should have an app like this its a shame that they dont,0
this is a great application i utilize it for everyday usage and manage my accounts very efficiently get this app,1
and getting better with every release,1
this is a simple and useful app that delivers on irs promises highly recommended for chase customers,0
this app is a joke when you go to look at your accounts every transaction is out of order making it impossible to keep track of purchases also you cant search for anything on it please make this app more like online banking,0
but the check deposit feature is crap it cant ever read the check and often crashes,0
now this app need is access to the rewards program,1
useful app for checking my account balances however it sorely needs to be updated for retina display,1
deposit feature revolutionizes the future of americaupdate uh duh they forgot to add push drop from  stars to  star until they fixupdate back to  stars can still use more features,1
the recent update still makes the activity screen unreadable not user friendly balances do not show info does not match with chase online banking the previous format was much much better,1
love this app easy to use and a great way to keep track of my money,1
i can check my balance make payments transfers and much more ,1
decent app but be careful because this app does not always show the correct balance on more than one occasion i compared it to the balance on the chase website with different balances,0
this app is worthless  it let me connect and look at my account after trying  times and never again  im cancelling my chase bank account all together because their atm machines dont properly accept cash deposits either,0
the daily deposit limit is too low making the feature sort of useless,0
i use this to check on transactions does what i need,0
i have come to rely on my chase app but lately its crashing so much it says its logging in but nothing happens very frustrating please update ,0
i love the app when it works ever since the update i have no been able to use the mobile deposit please reupdate so that works,1
new update is terrible please fix bugs especially alerts or downgrade me to the old version worked fine before,0
get it now you wont be disappointed,1
everything works just like i like it to work,1
despite running the updates and restarting my phone multiple times this app always crashes when i try to use the deposit feature please fix it,0
this app has been working fine for years but now everytime i choose to look at the details of my account it crashes,0
i downloaded the update and now every time i try to access my checking account the app closes suddenly i uninstalled it and reinstalled it and still does the same thing please fix,0
although i bank with several institutions and use their mobile banking apps i prefer my chase banking relationship however it just baffles me how ssslllllooowww the mobile app is ugh frustrated,1
i used to love this app but ever since this latest update we cannot view one of our accounts on my iphone my husbands iphone and my ipad worked perfect before the update,1
works well except for the occasional difficulty with depositing a check,0
since the latest update it crashes constantly i am on ios  beta  and cannot get it to run more than  secs it worked just fine before its latest update please fix,0
this app is cool ever since i got it i have beenusing it constantly,0
im not sure if its cause the app is not ready for the bigger screen on the i but i have black going on the top and bottom its a waste of space,0
since i updated this app the other day it still doesnt work correctly  i cant deposit or view alerts on wifi,0
i have deleted redownloaded and updated this app more times than i can count even getting an email saying to do so and it still doesnt work i want to drop chase just so i can get a bank that can figure out an app,0
got an email that i had to update new app by nov   so after deleting my old app which worked fine now the new app says it installed on my phone but it didnt now i have no app at all to access my account very disappointed,1
works great for me now and always dont know what the complaint is all about,0
worked great for me installed app made deposit and it worked flawless,0
cant even login doesnt work at all over wifi login times out please fix this app hasnt worked for weeksi used to love the app especially the check deposit ,1
why do i have to upgrade the app every month in order to check my accounts chase can we spread them out a bit so its not such a inconvenience,0
it is extremely frustrating that the app now longer works over wifi connection on the iphone please fix immediately and i will change to  stars,0
up and down sometimes sends alerts sometimes doesnt havent received a daily alert in  days slow inconvenient sends an alert balance that is different from the real balance deceiving,0
i used to love this app when i first got it but now its rare when it actually opens its always saying my session has timed out when it hasnt even opened its very irritating because when it would work it was a really good app,0
app works but does not correctly reflect available balance sometimes for days at a time i make purchases thinking i have money then i check one day and poof its gone fail,1
i love this app its easy to use and explain to my customers,0
app was working great last  weeks i have not been able to deposit checks its one of the main reasons i stick with this bank,0
used to be perfect but now every time i go to deposit a check and take a picture of the back on my check it crashes   please fix or i will find a bank that can at least can make a decent app,0
its very easy to access my bank statements love the app,0
bank of america checks use a slightly different number formatting at the bottom of the check for the routing and account numbers the chase mobile app fails at properly parsing these,0
keypad always gets stuck when making a payment after i enter the amount it wont let me do more selections because the keypad is on the way then the whole app just crashes ridiculous __ fix asap please,1
i cant transfer funds or make a payment the keyboard will not get out of the way pointless app when i can text for my balance use the mobile web site its much less frustrating,0
after reading the reviews for the latest update i really hesitated to install but you are not given a choice to continue to app without doing it forgot my password and had to use computer anyway,1
the save user name feature isnt working,0
i would expect a way better app from such a huge bank please update to new version chase that actually works,0
this app used to be great for check deposits current version crashes every time when taking a picture,1
after installing the app i launched it it shows the launch screen then goes black i have trying relaunching the app after taking it out of the app switcher and still nothing so i deleted it and reinstalled it and still nothing,0
used to be great app with no problems but now account transfers arent working once you get to confirmation screen next button not functioning called the support number and they were not helpful at all,1
it lets you know your balance and all but it eventually just combines your deposits and purchases so you dont have proof of when exactly you spent or deposited something,0
see the title installed and deposited a check the first time saved me a trip to the atm,0
i just installed the newest release to an iphone  now the app no longer opens i had used the previous version nearly every day with no issues  you would expect that the app would be tested prior to release,0
i like this app it works great for me never had a problem,1
now it will only allow me to pay the minimum amount on my credit card i used to pay off the balance of last statement customer service for the app was useless this app is now useless,1
what is an icon change going to do how about actually redesigning the ui like many other banks have done for awhile now gets the job done but could be a lot better,1
i love this app it has saved me so many times from awkward situations its so fast and easy,0
like many others i found that direct deposit is not working with the new update please fix it as this was one of the useful features of online banking,1
i just downloaded signed in and paid my bill great app,0
on my s the keyboard doesnt go away even when i click the done button when trying to use quickpay that leaves the next button covered up making it impossible to use,1
this app is only opening for me its not downloading and giving me an icon its a pain once im finally in the app its great just not liking having to search for it every time i want to use it,1
every time i try to make a deposit it crashes sometimes after the front view pic and sometimes after the back view pic but i can no longer complete a deposit how about an update chase,1
love the new look same great functionality,1
its better than old but it could be more than that,1
update looks cool but have been unable to deposit checks since update,1
the update made the app more visually appealing but whenever i try to take a photo to deposit a check using the app on my iphone s it crashes please fix this,1
i have to admiti really really like the new update the layout is nice and the greeting is a pretty cool new feature,1
this new app looks great but it doesnt work as good as it looks your acct balance doesnt update as fast and chase quick pay turned into slow pay or  day pay needs a update fast,1

app update killed ability to upload check images that was the main reason i used the app and why i liked banking with chase this i musthave functionality for me,0

until today the app never displayed a number in red next to it today it has a red circle with the number  in it no clue what it means but its useless and makes me believe the app is buggy iphone  plus,1
this app makes you update way too many times with the update you still cant use old os for a banking app i would think older os could still be used,1
i like this app most of the time is helpful except when i try to deposit a check and all of the sudden the app shuts down which does not help me very much otherwise i like it,1
app works well i like the text alerts better than the push alerts,1
love the app and its interface but would love if you could incorporate touch id for iphones more secure login,1

wow lets update something that doesnt need updating just so we can put advertising on our page amp annoying pop ups what a waste last version worked fine with out all the extra hoops,1

i love how easy the app is to navigate saves me tons of trips to the bank awesome app,1
with just a few clicks to can see all the info you need,1
just because itunes  requires an update we may not have room on phone  to do that therefore it take away the option to use the app services but in the update it says chase its responsible for itunes lack of privacy,1

every time the app fails to recognize my fingerprint which happens frequently it locks my account forcing me to go through a lengthy online process to reset my password ive heard of tight security measures but seriously this is overkill,1

this app has repeatedly locked me out over the past several months it claims im entering an incorrect usernamepassword when i know im not once chase admitted this was a known bug theyve stopped admitting thatbut the bug is still here,1
i go to a college where the nearest chase bank is  miles so this is a life saver,1

no touch id isnt chase supposed to be one of the largest banks in the country fidelity bank a small regional bank around atlanta has this feature in its rather mediocre app chase really needs to get it together that password is too long and bloody complicated,1
great app for a great bank it allows you to manage most of your banking,1
maybe someday they will fix the mobile check deposit function until then its only good for checking your balance,1
alerts are not user friendly  you have to do some guessing and digging to read the alerts,1
when logging in using the touch id it will ask me to lock in manually and after i do it manually it will asked me to reset my password i have to reset my password almost every other day,0
as promised  stars ,1
deposit checks by taking a picture never works have perfect lighting perfectly straight and within the borders and it still doesnt work the app closes out randomly all the time,0

app forces you to update after youve already put in your un and pw if youre going to force updates before continued use dont wait until after the user has i put their pw or at least dont make them do it again after update,1
i dislike that you have to go inside the app to view the transactions made when before i would get messages alerts is there any way this can get changed back,0
love the chase app very simple to use and extremely convenient,1
this app handles the basics i can view credit card activity and pay my bills nothing special,1

good app except it wont allow you to change locations to search for branchesunless i am missing something,1
lovesssss new update deposits from home or anywhere really is awesome deposits went through next day awesome,1
love that i can pay my bills and much more thank you chase,0
i dont have the deposit feature my aunt and uncle do  my aunts is  different account type but my  uncles is the same account as mine   this thing is a big fail,0
thanks for the help with the badges on the app myrobot correct now i can stop bein annoyed by the  badge haha,0
they need quick deposit for the new g ipod touch that is one of the main reasons i got this app but there is no option for it other then that this is a great app,0
i love this app the quick deposit works great all the time ,1
the app while initially took several attempts to take  the check in simply stopped working one day  bank of america charged  to close the account even if the one feature that i opened the account for did not work,0
app was the whole reason i switche to chase it works great never had a issue yet,0
i personally use this app all the time very easy and useful,0
i no longer need to go the atm to cash my checks,1
great app but why is it so hard to clear notifications you have tried to do this with the last  versions and im sick of it  just make a clear notifications button once you log in do that and ill go back to  stars,1
no matter how many times ive updated the app and even deleted and reinstalled the app ive never been able to get the quick deposit function on my phone why,1
it shows that there is  notification on the app with the red dot and a  in it and when i open the app it says it is under the more tab and for the life me i cannot get rid of it it is driving me crazy someone help me,1
quickdeposit waits until after you take photos of both sides of the check to verify the amount field and tell you its over the daily limit,0
i think banks and bank practices are a blight on our country  that said they finally did something right  kuddos chase  this app rocks,0
thank you soooo much for the update i always wanted an app that was complete crap and you have delivered ive never been able to find a branch or atm with your app and now the notifications will not go away,0
this is a useful app but it is very slow at updating the remaining available credit its very confusing to know how much credit you do have left and sometimes it wont sign in need major updating,0
it freezes when entering an amount under pay bills then crashes,0
i use it mainly for checking balances and chase quickpay and this app works perfectly for it ,1
im not sure what everyones problem is with this app but it works awesome for me,0
i love the interface and the whole lot,0
a really nice app and im sure itll make you excited too,0
its frustrating because i havent been able to use it since i downloaded it a month ago every time i log on i get a message saying that they cant display my acct info on my mobil device iphone dont know what to do,0
app does not match the pc versiondoesnt actually do much  most importantly allow me to pay my cc or car payment  keeps telling me i do not have an account connected to process such a transaction when in fact i do,0
this used to be a great app now it hardly works very frustrating times out on log in and when it does finally log me in i cant access anything please fix this,0
i keep getting email telling me theres an upgrade but theres not one in my updates the second email confirmed that the app wasnt working and to try again still no app update and today is the last day,0
before the update it was working fine i cant login all the sudden i called chase technical support telling me to reinstall and it didnt do jack squat fix nowi gave it  stars because i know they will try,0
well kept app always reliable definitely worth the free download,0
ive had the chase app for years and have always found it helpful and easy to use whats happened  nothing ever goes thru its been a horrible app to use i always have to go to a laptop to make my transactions  please fix it,1
i havent been able to log into the app for weeks  it is ridiculous that a company like chase can have a broken app for so long  the mobile site doesnt work either  fix it,0
i will like to see maps added to the app so i can view all atm and bank branches on a map opposed to only a list shorting by distance,0
i can no longer submit checks through the mobile app for deposit because it crashes the moment you try to take a picture,0
i can never deposit checks using this app there always seems to be a problem luckily i have ing direct and their app has taken every check i have tried to deposit with no issues,0
used to work fine but app crashes when photographing checks for deposit,0
the app was great when you were able to log in  updates later they still cant seem to fix the issue pretty frustrating,0
your app has no problem sending me notifications thats you want my money but when i log in to pay i cant fix your pay button so that it actually does something,0
ive never written a review for apps in my life but i felt i had to today this is so frustrating the older version was fine then i was forced to upload the newer one and im totally screwed it does not open it does nothing useless,0
i use it to check my account balance and its great,0
works then it doesnt work then it doesnt work i havent been able to log in over a week so annoying but it is good when it works please fix it to work,1
unable to login for the past  days now never had any issue till just this week it is a great app and i had it as a  star rating for now im giving it a  star till they fix the problem or till us whats going on,0
this app times out whenever i try to log in from both cel network or wifi  it has only worked twice in  months  totally useless  called and they told me to ask my cel phone provider  ni ine can make it work i am annoyed,0
loved it before but now it shuts down and logs of when i try to make a deposit its gotten slower and occasionally kicks me off for no reason now please fix this app,1
i have to agree with most of the one star reviews as well  this forced update thing is ridiculous  especially when i want to check my account really fast and not near my computer  what a hassle,1
trying to pay my credit card bill but next button doesnt work payment process has too many screens very confusing and no explanation as to why i cant pay,0
i have not been able to log in for over a week now due to maintenance issues i have deleted and reinstalled the app and get the same issue  for a bank this size this is completely unacceptable,1
i have not been able to my account for about  days now needed it in a emergency todayfirst it cant save my user id now this enough with the incompetent applications,0
everything was working fine until one day out of nowhere it just stopped working it just kept loading and loading and loading and thats it never opened,0
no check viewing,1
after downloading new is  software on my iphone s  i tried to log into my account and the system states to try again later  have re installed app a few times with same results  please fix,0
when going through paying credit card the next button wont work so cant complete transaction,0
does everything u need it to dofast amp simple,0
does what i need it to do without problems,1
app crashes when trying to take pictures of the check tried uninstallingreinstalling app several times to fix it no dice,1
this app works perfectly on my iphone ,0
this app is useless to me i can no longer take pictures or make payments i use this everyday for my business i rely heavily upon being able to do banking with my mobile device maybe its time to change banks,1
cannot take pictures of checks without the app crashing extremely inconvenient,1
its been awesome but sometimes when i log in the app freezes and wont actually log on and open,1
the app crashes every time i try to deposit a check it hasnt been updated since the new os from a company like chase one of the biggest banks in the world this just communicates laziness and lack of customer care,1
ive been using this app with no problem until the last few weeks i cannot log on it says my account does not have any accessible accounts bull i used right along guess you dont want my mortgage payment,1
this app is the worst banking app in the country depositing checks through this app is always a nightmare good thing im only using this bank as a a back up bank of americas app is the best been using their app since it started and never had a problem at all,1
awesome  love the large text and easy navigation ,1

the old app kept track of the balance minus pending helping me track possible overdraft i will now need a calculator to avoid such fees the colors are bland and will further depress me when i see the numbers,1
very user friendly,1
previous version was much better the new version is really ugly and confusing to navigate i would not have updated however this was a forced update thanks for making my banking complicated,1
i rarely get my deposit to work the first timesometimes the chase mobile deposit doesnt work at all i love chase and this app  please fix this,1

i am unable to deposit checks using this app it doesnt even give me the deposit option at the bottom of the screen ive deleted and reloaded this app several times dislike,1
very good app but logs me out every time i exit the app is this supposed to happen how do i fix it i have the keep me signed in checked,1

great app it makes my life easier thanks chase,1
love this app makes banking so easy,0
makes keeping track of your banking a snap,1
i use it on a regular basis just keep adding features please make sure your coding for this app is secure pun intended,0
the updates finally feels like a reall iphone app super nice with the swipe menu and great ui,1
i update to the new app an now i cant even load the app try to delete a couple time an it doesnt work,0
this app no longer works might as well use safari the app has been broken for at least  weeks i never review but if this is what the app is like now how can you trust chase with the upcoming apple pay,0
the only thing missing from this app is touch id access to your accounts,0
even with clear pics of the check the deposit fails not relaiable app for deposit needs improvement,0
it a good app that tells how much you got as soon as you buy something so it cool to use,0
it truly only works  of the time which is unfortunate because generally when im trying to use it is because i need to use it i like the old one this one is too tempromental,0
still way better than other banks apps that ive used but you still need touch id and iphone  optimized app,0
this app always worked fine now i cant do deposits anymore the iphone s takes a picture but i cant use it,0
cant press the use check button it just zooms in on the check,0
just like everyone else in the last week i was forced to update the chase app and can no longer deposit checks with the app using my iphone i live nowhere near a branch but there are plenty of other banks around,0
seems like im having the same problem as everyone else since the last update when i take a picture of the check it wont let me click use or retake,1
i am so frustrated that if chase doesnt fix the auto deposit button soon i am switching bank accounts  wth  it hasnt been working for at least a week   frustrated for sure,1
please fix the app for the iphone s i was taking a picture of my check and the use button doesnt even work to deposit the check,0
i do not like this new app i can tell what has been paid or what as not account activity is gone go back to the one that tells you everything you want to know,0
i have an older iphone so now i cant use the app anymore  it says you have the option of downloading the older version however it doesnt do it  i have no choice but to delete the it what a shame because i loved this app,1
app on average is good does my thing with quick pay and minimal account manipulations but constant updates require additional efforts en route of my banking tasks i dont want to focus on,1
i am not going to install new software on my phone  i love using this app and i cant use the new one until i update my software i guess ill have to wait another  years when i buy a new phone to use this app again,1
very disappointed that theyve updated the app so much that i cant use it on my i touch which is my only means to use it not too thoughtful  i guess they only want customers with newer smart phones,1
i would always get notifications but i could never get to the page with the messages before the app crashes such a bad app for such a big bank,1
no more lag very fast and finally it looks great on the iphone ,1
i have a few different banks and most seem to have the touch id integrated my capital one wallet app allows me to do this care to get with the new age,1
i used to be happy with this app since the new update it has been a hassle for me it doesnt show the minimum payment due the balance and the credit you have left over i miss it the way it was before,1
i just started banking with chase bank and im not impressed with their mobile app i currently use a capital one and usaa app and their apps are far superior hopefully an improved update comes soon,1
very convenient no real issues plus the new touch id works great thanks chase ,1
i used to have the displeasure of banking with boa and their app wasnt great this bank and this app are awesome,1
makes accessing your accounts a finger print away love it,1
quick and easy chase hit a home run with this one,1
really effective and convenient way to handle your money thumbs up ,1

makes it hard to get logged in spent  minutes trying to reset password and gave up i work for a company that makes banking apps this is terrible service,1
very convenient to deposit checks,1

i had a cheque followed the instructions and it was deposited in a couple minutes no lines no fees yay,1
for a very basic app offering little insight and access its very buggy and not so reliable i often get error messages stating we cant process your request at this time please try again later,1
chase is among the best most prompt and organized and the chase banking app is no exception,1
the new update forces you to do  clicks to see your card transactions when the old version only required one it was more convenient the old way the old version was much better,1
seems every time i need to pay my bill i need to reset my password and you cant do that via the app  very frustrating   also  i write my passwords down so im not sure what is going on,1

latest update just crashes the app repeatedly good work chase you guys short on money to hire the talent to develop a stable app with all the fees you charge i would think you could make ends meet,1
im happy with the ease of use with this app,1
it is not very user friendly in how to do things i have yet to find out if there is any help or directions how to do something,1
why did they remove the touch id sign in feature in the new update it was so convenient bring it back,1

i love the app its so convenient and i hardly have to go to the bank,1
makes depositing checks so easy ,0
finally touch id love the app all my banking needs at my fingertips,1
good in every way except that when searching for nearby atms it only shows one choice,1
downloaded this app twice and after i sign in it just signs in until my phone shuts off the branch locator works fine but thats about it just gonna keep going to the chase website,1
just switched from wamu and found this app to be seriously lacking visually in comparison so much so that i want to switch banks if they wont take the time to make a decent app what does that say about the bank in general,0
this app has came a long way they delievered on the much needed improvements,1
chase did a nice job on this one pay bills check balances and find atms all in an elegant interface,1
i have deleted the app five times and reinstalled just to try and get it to workcrashes every time right after i enter my passwordchase for all the money i give you this is the least you can do,0
well it does what you need it to do its just not as smooth or ascetically pleasing like other bank apps souls really try to work on that,0
unfortunately i just tried to deposit a check and the amount exceeds the allowable amount for this feature great concept poor execution,1
i travel a lot and this app helps me stay on top of my accounts it great,1
depositing checcs from your iphone is off the chain whoever thought that one up deserves a raise lol convienence and simplicity nice job people,0
love this app but please add the ability to alert a bill due date,0
everytime i take a picture of my check to deposit it never works and i tried so many different times other than that checking ur points and acct balance and transferring  is great,1
i like almost all the changes the only one that i dont like is hoe you see the activities i like how it was better,1
woke great my favorite feature is the check deposit,0
the app was fine until the recent update i cant log anymore at all which is particularly annoying since there are zero branches in the state i live in and i am obliged to deposit my checks through the app i now have no way to deposit checks update immediately please,1
it didnt let me do anything but check my balance and transactions there wasnt even a deposit feature for me,0
i downloaded it and there was no deposit option at the bottom does any one know why,1
you should add the available balance for credit cards,0
i like the app but i have  requests make the deposits amounts a green text they get lost among the blue text the transaction descriptions arent long enough i cant tell what some of my transactions are,0
good lord this app is slow it connects to my accounts about  of the time not very reliable depositing checks works okay for everything else i hope youre patient,1
easy to use helpful alerts makes finding an atm easy as pie,1
sometimes it works and sometime it doesnt when it works its great when it doesnt its rather frustrating,0
my phone wont update to the latest version of chase mobile it is stuck on version  its very irritating because i cant update it from the app store,0
my alert notice doesnt clear and my email address doesnt save,1
love this app but since the update that happened the other day my alert notification wont go away i even uninstalled and reinstalled really annoying,0
the app was great until the update now the account alert wont go away and the app keeps crashing ,1
i use this app frequently after the update the red notifications havent gone away they appear i check them and usually they disappear afterwards not the case after the update please fix this thanks,0
agree with everyone else after new update alerts wont clear and i find it annoying to have red alerts on my apps that i cant clear deleted appi will get it back once bugs are fixed,0
no problems with anything but i just use a atm to deposited my checks im not that lazy,0
i really like this app the more i use it the more things i find to love it,0
crash crash crash even after deleting and reinstallingthis was a great app and now i cant even open itlatest update damaged the app on my s was working perfectly and now crashes almost every time,0
every update makes the deposit work worse i usually try three times n then i mobile deposit to other bank which works first every time,0
it does everything i need to do when im on the go,0
keypad wont hide when making payments please fix very frustrating this feature used to work reinstalling does not fix,1
i would recommend to it anyone,0
the deposit feature very rarely works the rare occasion it does work it takes at least  attempts to go through any plans to fix this,0
ever since i updated this app i get false notifications about my account alerts come in left and right that are clearly someone elses transactions i dont know if my account is crossed with somebodys or what but its annoying its  do better,0
got this app specifically for the convenience of the check deposit via photo feature yet it rarely works and tech support says there are no known issues  very disappointed,1
downloaded the app a few weeks ago and it installed with two chase icons on my phone i deleted the app but was left with an installing icon that i cannot get rid of i downloaded the app again and i still cant get rid of it,0
how many customers have chase eliminated by stopping support of ios  without warning typical of their attitude or is it the total incompetence of their development teamand why limit check deposits to  this app is a waste of time,1
this app was working great for the first few months as of about  weeks ago right after i upgraded the apple software on my phone i cant get on the app it times me out while logging on makes me want to switch banks,1
for the last few months i cant even log on very frustrating  ive turned my phone on and off and it still doesnt fix the bug  chase please fix soon,1
it works perfectly,1
i tried both mobile and ipad and am no longer able to log in with either one i see others are having the same issues hello chase are your it coders out there,0
 of the time this app will not work i thought it was my old iphone but i just got a new phone and it still rarely works   even there website is down most of the time,1
i love the app and i would give it  stars normally but it hasnt work in about two months now it doesnt let me log in due to loading issues and timing out please fix this issue,1
every time im around another person using a chase card it tells me on this app,1
the old version at least logged me in since i have updated it which i had no choice it has not logged me in i deleted it and reinstalled it still it just says logging in and never does annoying,0
it is not working these days please we need a new upgrade,0
well for me clean downloadinstall a hasnt crashed on me yet looks pretty slick also lol,1
love this app no issues with my iphone s  love the features and convenience,1
overall a dissent app but startup speed is way to low and that is the major concern the fixation will be appreciated,0
the app has not been working since the  update this has been a serious problem for my business looking at moving accounts to another bank with stable mobile support,1
anywhere u can deposit ur check,0
will not remember user id even when selected otherwise works well,1
which makes the app do not remember the user id pls fix tyafter that being fixed ill come back with more stars ty again ,1
 fail every single time ive tried to log on ive received an error message apologizing for the inability to log on at this time it does however encourage me to come back and fail again later thanks ive fallen for it  times now blow me,1
very disappointed i have been trying to log in for the past  weeks and have been unable to unacceptable for a bank of its size maybe chase us waiting for more bailout funds to improve its app,1
depositing checks is a snap easy to use great app,1
love this app i handle most banking with it and love the alerts functions feel a lot more secure having it,1
it wont let me log in until i go onto a computer and agree to something seriously i dont have my laptop with me this week so i cant access my account info wow thanks chase,0
this is a great app we dont really need to go into the bank however it crashes on deposits every time    please fix,0
this app use to work great no problems since last update i have problems paying my bill the next  button stays greyed out even with every category selected account amount etc please fix this,1
was trying to do a deposit says the picture is not clear have you mind im on a new iphone   smh ,0
this updated icon is the worst ive seen in a long time with any updated app having said that app is and has always been seamless form vs function,0
just deposited a check through this app on an iphone ,0
fast simple and has never failed me,0
it makes bankin so easy now if it would spit out money that would be great,0
saves time visiting the bank to make deposits,1
app no longer useful and chase seems to think they fixed the issues but have not changing cookies did not work apple needs to get their act together also no wonder samsung is gaining market share,0
ever since the upgrade all the pictures for the deposit are now said to not be clear enough  phone has not changed  really frustrating since this was a great feature,0
please add cc balance under each transaction in the activity section,0
got an email that i had to update new app by nov   so after deleting my old app which worked fine now the new app says it installed on my phone but it didnt now i have no app at all to access my account very disappointed,0
the app is good for checking your balance should add a feature next to each transaction to show updated balance,1
as long as youre just checking your account balance or making a transfer you are fine with this app  times out of  the app quits when i try to deposit a check,1
the app is meh the main reason for me was the ability to deposit checks but it almost never works hire a designer and developer and get this right its embarrassing that a company of this size cant get it right,1
deposit feature has not worked ever in  months of trying various checks and times same deposits work on bofa app without any problem,1
wow what a big difference its x better nowmore stylishand awesome looking,1
i use the app to do my banking on the goi dont need frilly picture to log in an get in my wayfount way to large and other tabs way to smallim rolling back this update to fix the problems you created  star if i could give it,1
this app is now wasting so much real estate please look at the app mahana to see how an app can use the whole screen i actually like the older version better due to the use of space,1
do not like the new app its all very well to give it a more modern look and better  but you really missed the mark guys it was a great app before i especially hate the account activity page i want a running balance at all times fix it,1
new version is nice to look at but you can no longer view transactions just see current balance not sure why that was taken away,1

very useful and convenient easy to use,0
nice improvement from the previous chase app,0
great functional and good looking app,0
the app is alright but chase seems to be doing maintenance often there should be a way to look at or download your statements from the app,0
just got the chase app for the freedom cardworks well and is pretty simple to use,1
easy to use,0
easy to navigate and allow me to do all my banking,0
no complaints or suggestions,1
works exactly how i need it too while looking and feeling great,0
doesnt allow you to see account activity app has the minimum functionality for chases interest but nothing that allows the user to doublecheck their account,1
i wish its easier to check alert i have  accounts and i have to hunt for alert messages also i want to see my balance as soon as i log in instead of pushing buttons  times honestly bofa app is much easier,0
alerts and message center shows number but i cant get to any information very frustrating its been like this for a year at least,1
been waiting for this update since the last one would let me deposit my checks on my s still not working with this new update  should be called upset,1
would be nice to use touch id to log in instead of password or at least have the option,0
new devices have been out for months now app looks horrible and stretched on larger displays and make use of toych id like other apps jake password do will make logins easier,0
used to love this app but now find little to no value from it  i have s and am not able to deposit checks amp used to be able to check my acct activitycant now  about all it enables me to do is look up acct balances,1
i like the app except that i cant transfer funds to other accounts,1
previous version was great but i can no longer take photos of checks to deposit them update soon please to fix this,1
honestly the touch id is the only thing holding the app back from receiving  stars,0
i love chase but y do they update their app about every  months for higher version compatibility  not everyone has the luxury of upgrading iphone every year,1
use it every daymakes life a lot easier,1
i use this every day works great for me cant be without it,0
why do i have to update my os which takes up lots of storage space each time i need to update the chase app chase developers iphone s users still exist,0
actually its a great app the problem is the new update that is not supported in the previous generation its frustrating knowing its a good app and yet it only supported by the new gens gizmos,0
according to the badge i currently have  unreadsi do not should have zero,1
always works easy intuitive simple just love it,1
this app is really good it works for me regularly rarely any problems,1
app works ok but there are too many tools on the menu i wander when they will implement touch id as even my local credit union has already updated theirs,1
it is so strange that the login screen runs away when i tap the app occasionally other than this it is a great app,1
awesome app clean interface but just needs touch id support like all my other banking apps,1
it wont let me log in even though i know my password yet when i log on to the website it works but not for the app and its annoying how i cant even use my own account on the app itself ,1
good app yet very basic would be helpful to allow ability to edit transaction titles for easier book keeping,1
considering chase was one of the earliest adopters of apple pay it seems odd that they dont have enough faith in the feature to adopt touch id for bank login that or they are glacially slow at rolling out new features for their app either way  a pity,1
easy to use and super convenient best mobile banking app ive used,1

i dont have any complaints,1
i like chase bank secure and good for business and personal use,1
i save a lot of time and organize my finances,1
convenient and easy to use for digital banking,1
managing payer from the app and not from a computer is very cumbersome and impossible to remove payees even if added in error managing payers for multiple accounts is ineffective and and doesnt seem to remain once preferences are selected,1
this app is pretty goodit does what its supposed to do once you get into it its seriously needs touch login come on chase get with it,1
nice and convenient ui consistent with the web version,1
does everything i need it to,1
its easy to deposit get updates send money what else do you need,0

great app works every time has saved me a lot of time,1
simple easy to use easy on the eyes,0
love the ataglance feature so useful and userfriendly,0
good app needs to have thumbprint password functionality,1
this is the main reason why i chose chase to begin with,0
this app lets you see balances and payment due date not a lot of helpful account info or related material but does the basics i like the notifications when used  too bad touch id is not supported now,1
no complaints app does what i need it to do,1
you dont complete my request regarding transaction too my account i request depositbalancewithdrawal,0
so far i have nothing bad to say this app work well for me right now,1
use it for all my banking needs with chase,0
try the bofa app and youll see an amazing app fluid and full of functioning features the chase app is an app but bland and limitless just as far as add the option to see your routing number or acct number without going to the website,0
have had multiple issues trying to deposit checks cannot recommend this app at all,1
see above,1
its misleading and method used to rip off customers by not allowing the option to make a recurring payment of clients choosing but rather only allowing for minimum payment,1
cant live without it ,1
if you not with chase you not really banking,1
the old app was an easy to understand list by date the paper statement facsimile idea is difficult,1
very convenient and user friendly,0
i usually have a good experience with the app however since last update it is losing the touch id after the first use i hope that gets fixed again,1
always doing updates or something when i need it is unavailable they should do the updates  early in morning like  am or so,0
this is a great app i can do everything on my phone love this bank,1
look it very convenient and handy,1
only con is there isnt a direct link to the credit score review they offer,1
its super inconvenient to have a secure password and no touch id in this app chase should really think about this otherwise a useful app,1
it is such a convenient way to check my account  good job chase ,0
the password requirements are paternalistic and not usercentered mostly they should just implement touch id capital one is way ahead on this,1
it used to work but hasnt for me the last couple times ive tried months apart  the pictures are perfectly clear and very legible theres no excuse for this,0
simple and easy to use on iphone  plus,1
this app is crap will not let you remotely deposit checks i have been trying for  weeks to remote deposit my checks and it keeps telling me it cant read the numbers whats the point in offering remote deposit if it doesnt work,0
great user friendly app fraud alert notices on suspicious activity amp convenience give peace of mind,1
this app is really easy to use and very convenient,1
i do not leave home without this app,1
banking with chase via its app is incredibly convenient wherever one ventures,1
this app feels like something out of the mids stale app is unreliable often receive message this transaction is unavailable at this the try again later not exactly what you want to see from your bank,1
this app is awesome when it works unfortunately the app is down more often than id like,1
i use wells fargo citi discover amex and others this is the poorest by far not easy to get around not easy to find things i recommend you use the web,1
great app to use for my credit card,1
fix your app it repeatedly does not accept my password and i have to reset it every few days the touch feature is also not working extremely annoying,1
pretty good app works most of the time rarely do i have problems with it i recommend it,1
its a good app i just wish that the pending period to show payments would be shorter,1
works great really only used in emergencies so not too much use,1
great app very convenient user friendly the new fingerprint entry is awesome,1
i love this app  best way to check my account activity on the go,1

no qualms with the app has been working well for my family,0
app works as expected i havent had any issues not easily resolved by closing amp reopening,1
it would be better if the notifications came in on time ive missed quickpay notices because the app fails to notify me,1
user friendly even for someone who is not that tech savvy helpful for me in many ways,1
chase needs to update account data per the app so that it matches real time account activities and actual balancesi get push messages from the app and or chase that are two or three days behindits almost like chase wants app users to think they have more money than they actually do so that they then over draw the account sneaky way to rack up overdraft feesjust get the updates to match actual account activity,1
simple to use shows more info,1
as its designed to which is all that i need,1
super convenient and user friendly for me,1
it has stopped sending push notifications and there is no setting to turn it back on,1
some of the interfaces are a bit clunky,0
pretty good i like it easy to make payments and check my account,1
one of the best bank apps i have usedvery customer friendly,1
i love the chase app very convenient and easy to use,1
but i have only just started using it stay tuned for opinion adjustment prn,1
its very easy and convenient to use,1
enjoy the app easy to use love the one touch access  awesome awesomeness,0
i like the layout of the older version better thats just my opinion though,0
design and layout on the new app is great navigation is much simpler,1

app always works great features are user friendly love it,1

love the app could be streamlined to be a bit more friendly for those not familiar with finance appsoverall its a great appjorge,1
good upgrades glad they finally added touch id support,1
this option is crap on this version no matter what i do the pictures that i take her always not clear enough this is the hugest inconvenience for me at the moment because there are no atms or branches in the city of nashville tennessee,0
seriously you probably have a ton of developers im tired of updating this app every week why even have fingerprint login if i have to go to the apple store every week to update the dang app get it together,1

thank you chase for finally developing an easy to use personal banking platform for the iphone,1
it shows current balance shows checking and savings and has a wire transfer option its as basic as basic can be search for nearest atm only retrieves the closest one so even though theres  atms in ur neighborhood only one is mapped oh and u have to close the app and reopen to access the atm search screenthe reviews are true seems like chase pulled this one outta their anus,1
i put my password in all lower case amp it works fine better than going through your web browser,1
this app is awesome now i barely have to use my desktop anymore,1
i love this appl i use it all the time easy to use i made all my payments through this muy buena  i recomend it,1
first this app led me to a chase location that did not exist then when i finally found a chase bank and was sitting in the parking lot this app showed a different location miles down the road is this the best you can do chase,0
new native version works much better good job,1
they are still integrating the wamu infrastructure  i am sure this will work for you in the near future,1
thanks chase for listening and improving the iphone app ,0
this app is greatusaa has more features but this update definitely made a difference,0

i like this app its very slick amp user friendly its so easy to use amp its awesome try it out promise it wont dissapoint,0
it doesnt show if you have an scheduled payment for your credit card please fix this,0
anybody else getting the temporarily unable to connect message every other iphone application works but not this one in mine or my wifes iphone whats up with that this happens on g or wifi useless app as far as i am concerned,1
ive always been a chase and things like this app makes me stay faithful to chase,0
i love the picture deposit feature a real time saver,0
i have spent countless attempts to deposit a check through the app to no avail  i get error messages that the image is blurry  i tried different lighting positions but nothing worked i think they need to enhance the clarity somehow,1
i just want to be able to do the quick deposit too one of the reason for the th generation touch,1
this app was great until the newest download its much slower and not as user friendly  i wish i had another app choice for my bank,0
this app is great but there is a delay when updating your accts after you buy something so this leave you with an inaccurant balance pending,0
app used to work great loved it  now cannot get quick deposit to work for nothing everything updated  called chase was told they dont handle app app is pretty much useless for deposits,1
ive tried depositing two different checks using the app and both times it didnt work i wanted this app solely for this feature because of that it is useless to me,0
has all i need thanks for making it do easy to use,1
check deposit feature stopped working and the branch cant help me so where is somebody supposed to get help with this app,0
every day i get  alert however i cannot get rid of the alerts from the past so this morning i have  new alerts on my app show up instead of  tomorrow it will be  alerts really annoying please fix this,0
i love this app makes life and banking quick,0
this is a great app just dont  like how you have to set up specific notification and half of them dont work,1
every since the update i cannot see my personal accounts i can see them on my laptop and called chase where nothing was changed the representative says there is a problem with the app please fix,1
why wont it clear my alerts when i log in fix it amp your score would vastly increase since everything else works alright,0
good work im impressed with what ive seen and hope to see some improvements in the future,0
got the same problem after the update cant see any accounts saying i need to unhide them lol they arent hidden please fix it and bring it back to the way things were working before,0
thank you chase for fixing the badge problem,1
the glitches   the notifications willnot go away even when i tried todelete the app and put it back on it stayed app was great before the update,1
application was working fine until a couple patches ago now upon checking account transaction details crashes  of the time how about fix it so your customers can check their account activities thatd be nice wouldnt it,1
logintry to look at activity and all it does is crash stop messing with the app unless you people know it works every time you upgrade you screw it up worse used to be awesomenow its worthless,1
awesome app for one of the worlds richest banks simple easy to use and convenient too ,0
great app wish the notifications were easier to access,0
never had a problem before but with most recent update app force closes every time i try to take a picture to deposit my check please fix,0
before the august  update i was on ios  beta  on my iphone and this app worked fine  since the new update it crashes incessantly if it werent for my unupdated app on my ipad id be screwed  please address this chase,0
cant review checking transactions without app crashing  ios  beta   last versions all worked great  please fix ugh crash crash crash crash  removed rebooted reinstalled  no help,1
everything you need and easy to use,0
ive just installed this app but it already seems very useful,0
i have been using this app for a while and love it,1
very odd update enhanced for ios  for some reason its not using the new  screen its the same screen size for iphone ,0
luckily i read the reviews before updating the app old version works fine for me ill stick with it until they fix it i remember the last time apple upgraded its os a lot of apps had issues,1
its super frustrating changing banks from pnc to chase to find out that chases app doesnt work most of the time i cant even log on and if it does let me i cant do anything else disappointed with chases attention to detail so far,0
in the last few days as i am tryin to log in it takes forever i literally have to go to my laptop to log in to find out my balance please fix this is very inconvenient,0
as others have pointed out theres a big issue with the alerts  bill pay is also very glitchy  doesnt work  old version was much better,0
great app and finally supports a nice large screen,0
unacceptable someone should be fired over this seriouslynew update came out today and it is still broken cant log in again someone should be fired over this if not already done so,0
this is one of the worst app from chase this never log you in this app just sit occupy my phone memory i have at least installed and uninstalled more than  times not even worth one star,0
its so easy and convenient i have no problems with this app,1
without warning the app was updated and can no longer support older iphones which is ridiculous at least give us a cut off date now i have to waste all of my time and data to dl thishorrible,0
its sad how people became so spoiled this app is awesome no need to go to a computer or to the bank great job chase,0
i used to be able to log in like  out of  tries it was annoying but great when it worked now i havent been able to log on for days despite many many tries,1
depositing checks with this app used to be a convenient feature now there is a ridiculous  monthly limit on deposits so i still have to drive to the bank major failure,0
do not like the fact the app will not open with wifi  i always get a time out error  what is the point of the app if it does not work with wifi  i want it to work where i am i dint always have g but can access wifi,1
whatever they did to the latest version has ruined this app it used to be pretty good but  i cant even log in anymore wish they would fix this its been a while now,0
i can never log into this app it keeps spinning then times out the time i was able to get into it it wont let you transfer funds with your external accounts that are hooked to it,0
so other users reported the same problem i have time outs and consistent issues with logging on this app is totally useless do something applechase,1
this app is awesome the people cant use it need to try little hard its not rocket science,0
the app used to work fine for me but since update cant log in anymore keeps telling me im entering wrong information however when i log in on my computer everything is fine please fix,1
this app used to work fine but now i cant log in i was hoping the most recent update would fix it but still no luck if chase cant fix this i amleaving to another bank like ing direct that has great online banking,1
dont like new look and it doesnt seem to work as well,0
horrible access meaning no access from my iphone for the past few months this forced me to delete the app because its more frustrating than its worth let me know when you figure it out,1
easy to use alerts are received instantly,1
the functionality doesnt work  i cant pay my credit card   ahhhh,1
this app is a waste of time  times out of  you cant log on from phone and when you can forget about scanning checks for depositsmore trouble than its worth app works as good as the bankingterrible,1
simple easy reliable fast check depositing,0
cant deposit checks  cant transfer funds between accounts app is useless and now deleted from my phone considering closing my chase checking as well so i can bank w a company w respectable technology horrible app,1
maybe im just easy to please but i find it as helpful as it needs to be,0
i use this app all the time however when i try to add new payee after entering the info of the new payee the next option wont work please fix it,0
havent been able to log on in over a week both my wifes phone and our ipad are affected as well bad customer  service when it takes so long to fix a problem,0
worst app ever can look at my accounts but buttons to make payments work sporadically never when i need them to worthless,0
the atms the accept deposits that are not at branches should be noted when you search for atms it would be really helpful thanks,1
user name not being saved  please fix,1
all other functions work wish it would save userid like it use too please fix this issue,0
nd time i tried downloading and same result i enter my log in info then it gives me a message to try back later so i try later and get the same message wish i could get back the data i used to download,0
love this app so easy and such a great thing to be able to use,0
it will be  when they finally fix it so i can transfer money or pay bills again the keyboard wont go away to press the button to complete it thats the reason to have this app,1
chase support said app is running fine but it says it cant process my request to log in all my info is correct this is annoying because i cant access anything or deposit checks,0
the directions to find a branch or atm doesnt work now it asked to update the user after update loaded do you guys not test the app before you send out the update what the hell you guys made the app worse,0
 out of  i try to deposit checks it say picture not clear picture is clear app is stupid useless i always end up going to atm for depositsfix this guys,1
i have never had a problem with this app ever,1
great app if you have chase,1
the remote deposit feature of this app never works dont offer a service you havent figured out yet take some of those fees you gouge people with every month and hire some capable tech developers,1
app is ok lots of functionality however it is constantly forcing me to update to keep using it and usually when i need to do something in a hurry super frustrating and super unnecessary,1
your a bank with obvious money to spend you should be among the first to have your app updated yet were well into  with no signs of improvement spend some money for your customers you greedy jerks,1
looks visually stunning all these people giving it a low rating are hating  wf boa citi,1
its suppose to make life easier but its more confusing too much white buttons are not obvious you have to search fir the since they just blend into the background i have a problem navigating it i wish i could go back and not update,1
the check photo deposit function does not work since the photo taking of the check is not reliable simply a waste of time,1
great app  does whatever i need it to from transfers to quick pays  love it,1
great app easy access and never had any problem,1
easy to use and no glitches,1
very easy to use app that gives me enough options to get stuff done and retrieve any info i need,1

alerts are nice but they arent reliable for example if a restaurant incorrectly adds a tip to your bill above your alert threshold you wont be notifiedyou have to enter your password twice to login the account alerts history misses changes made right on the phone past statements are shown pdf style rather than a native transaction list you can search and drill into,1
i use it every day easy to navigate never down,1
i love chase mobile app easy to navigate easy access,0
i use the app the check my balances and pay statements my biggest complaint is that the touchid hardly ever pops up for me to login,1

easiest way to make a payment,1
twice now i have submitted my mortgage payment through the app and it posted twice this is causing my account to be overdrafted please fix it,1

i love this app easy to use plain english i make deposits transfers and check transactions at any time,1

but you cant change your password from within the app  profile management thats ez to find is a needed upgrade,1
the app works fine however i hate that i set up for the finger id sign in but it turns off for the next time i want to sign in so irritating,1
theres always a problem and i cant tell you how many times the touch screen login doesnt work for some reason now it does not work permanently for me this app is truly awful,1
no fingerprint reader user interface also needs a lot of work,1
super easy to use,1

very versatile amp easy to use sending money to friendsamp relatives is a great feature love this app,1

token does not seem to register so i end up having to type both the password and the token ended up just deselecting the token feature also no touch id even bank of america has touch id available chase can do better,1
nothing much to say besides flawlessly simple effective amp reliable,1
easy to use to check balances and do banking,1
thank you,1
quick and easy to use,1
this app resets and forces me to call into chase every couple months and talk to the customer service reps for min  minutes would be awesome to have some actual reliability from chase,1

it has almost zero functionality you can access your account balance make a transfer between accounts and thats about it,1
im tired of them having me update over and over i especially hate it when  im about to sign in for a serious matter and what do you know it needs a update,1
discover app is much more intuitive and functional dont have to update it every time i try to check my balance,1
every single time i try to log in i get a message  you must download the update how about you idiots stop updating it every other day and leave it alone makes the app completely unusable,1
wont be long after you set up touch id that it turns off and youre forced to reset you password ruins an otherwise good app,1
good app  i did not have any problems with the app i love how it works,1
push alerts and service works really great,1

this app has never worked well on a tablet but the latest version is a new low  a call phone sized window on a tablet do you people even test on real devices ,1
prefer to log on to full site and since app came out it is almost impossible  wish i didnt have to use it and especially that it wont landscape i do not use this app on phone just pad,1
this is so userfriendly  i use it every day and love it,0
app is easy to use best of all is the fingerprint recognition,0
banking at you finger tips i love this application everything is simple and easy to use  chase number ,0
i cant get see the accounts from which to make a payment would be great if it did but as is it doesnt work for me,0
this works great i can do all my banking with my iphone,0
this app is just a pretty login screen other than that its the smae ugly chase mobile website your better of using a bookmark in safari,1
i love the way it shows my transactions with this update well done,1
thanks for the update but i would like to see the add payee feature i will give it  stars when you guys add it,1
unable to view business account kicks back to log in page unable to transfer  from account to account please fix then it will be  star,0
im also having trouble  seems the app keeps having trouble connecting to chase i can see my balances but not transfer funds,1
now there is no way to do an immediate transfer you can only schedule for the next business day would be perfect if transfers could be done immediately like on previous version,1
overall the formating needs to be better it looks like a mobile website and not an app,0
even with the upgrades im still unable to see my personal accounts it worked fir a day and then broke this past weekend ive tried uninstalling and reinstalling and its still not a functional app for me,0
the old app worked like a charm downloaded the update and it acts like it will log in but then shuts the program down tried uninstalling and redownloaded it same thing please get this fixed thank you,0
couldnt be easier,1
good good app for basic info regarding your account can even do transfers,0
i use this app all the time its perfect for what i need and runs flawlessly,0
wont ever finish loading i loved wamu but since the buyout my customer service went to crap this is a perfect example of their business thank god they arent my primary bankchase is the biggest headache ever including this app,1
its a great app but i wish i could deposit my payroll check from my iphone  like usaa,1
great features  does everything and more  a+ chase,1
how many times does some need to enter identification codes to get this to work phone on file on websiteamp through bank is same phone using app  so why does it nvr recognize my phone every time i launch app ill stick w text alerts fail,1
i get an error message stating it is unable to display my account information on my mobile device this app is useless when trying to access your chase loans account info,0
check deposit feature doesnt work wish they would fix it,1
it would be nice to have a option to see your debit reward points and catalog retina display support for iphone  other than that it is a really great app,1
regardless of balance deposits using the photo option take days to clear  recommend you walk to the atm or bank and make a deposit dont waste your time with this app,1
i was hoping when i got my ipod  touch  i would have been able to do the photo deposit also the pixels are really killing my eyes come on retina display update,1
nice and easy to use app i havent tried all the features yet but so far it works very well ,0
i love my bank and i love this app update the app to display better graphics with retina display including the app icon,1
need to hide some of the saved user id name in case of phone being lost reward store,1
hello  no sign of push notifications anywhere,1
check deposit will not work no explanation from chase the alerts are annoying they need to be customizable otherwise they are useless i should be able to determine what triggers an alert and what the alert says why cant i transfer funds to nonchase accounts as i can with the full website fix these sloppy features and you have potential for  stars,1
it needs to have a pin password similar   to what paypal did,0
i really like the convenience of this app but why do i get a million push messages saying im overdrawn or my money is held,0
i love that i can see my balance and push notifications but the app needspin login entering my whole pw every time is annoying usaa is doing this and their app is killing it push settings inappi would like to edit my mobile settings in my mobile app better design for transactionstheyre not easily navigable and viewable while on the go,1
thanks for adding quick deposit for ipod touch g users,1
would be great if it worked log in errors never able to get a check deposit to actually work always receive one of a host of seemingly random generic error messages complete waste of time really,0
please make depositing checks available for the ipod touch th gen,1
i wish i received an emailed confirmation number when i make a credit card payment,1
i can view my balance and transactions amp ect,1
the deposit option is the best,1
i have deleted and reinstalled this app i have the iphone  but the picture deposit is not in it until they fix it i will reinstall it again,1
downloaded this app this morning and havent been able to log in all day i can log in to my account on the chase website but it says my id and password are incorrect when i put them in this app not cool,1
great app easy to the alert and bill pay options are nice touches,1
this works really well good for check image deposits,1
the quick deposit stopped working since latest update was working great please fix,0
this app is amazing and easy to use right on the go,1
deposit checks is one if my favorites,1
only problem i am having is depositing my check when i try it says error,1
everything works perfectly theres a catch read the instructions some people are so ignorant,1
i use this almost everyday perfect app for managing my money,0
stars,0
loved this app til the last update now it doesnt display pending transactions wish i could go backplease fix,1
great but please fix the bugyoull get a notice for an alert but when you go to the app it doesnt show  what the alert is not good,1
the camera function for deposits is useless and rarely works i thought it was my phone but despite a recent upgrade and efforts to make sure that the lens is cleanno luck nice idea but too buggy to be worth the effort,0
because i really wish this worked with external account transfers like the website does,0
honestly i am so impressed with the functionality of this app good job chase,0
every time i check the app its temporarily unavailable  i hope it gets fixed,1
app works great but there is a notification that will not go away kinda annoying,0
can no longer see info after the update  would be fine if they fixed it  i used to use it every day,1
what happen i hate that i always have to go in and remove alerts they used to go away every time you would log in  now i have to go in and remove,0
the alert notification wont clear  this happens way too frequently,0
this app is better than most other appshave,1
when making a deposit cannot enter amount after entering amount it goes back to  every time deleted and reinstalled app with same results very frustrating,0
every time i try to look at my checking account activity the app boots me out did not use to do that how am i supposed to see what is pending and how much money i really have besides having to go on to the website please fix,0
now it keeps force closing on me i cant check my balance anymore and its giving off alerts with wrong info tried to delete and reinstall but it keeps happening,1
very easy to pay bills online  great job chase,0
every time they update it they break  things cant pay bills because the number pad stays up last update was not letting me enter a dollar value at all fix one thing break  more get it together chase,1
best creation since fruit loops never had one problem,1
the app works but they need to correct the fact that the alerts zero out even after checking them,1
forces an update on its users that requires an update to the os if you cant update your os you can no longer use this app way to dump a bunch of your users chase thats just bad business and an allaround bad move you need to fix this two thumbs down,1
does everything it says it does love it,1
after logging in and clicking on my checking account it crashes immediately fix the bug in the new update,0
the alerts wont go away after checking them even after turning off all alerts the notification alerts keep going up to  now taking it off my phone now,0
love chase this app is simple to use amp convenient it has really great features,0
does not work on ios  beta  crashes shortly after login no matter what choice you make they really should have this fixed by now ios  production launch is imminent when is a fix coming,0
i highly recommend this wonderful app for ipad,0
download it now and see for yourself what its like,0
great functionality ease of use is also good,0
cool interface niece features and a great app overall,0
i love the new  years of statements,0
edit seems to work on g not wifi both apps fail when using wifi iphone and ipad on ios  avoid this upgradei use this app every day now its useless i cant make a payment says there are no accounts linked to my card cant view the alerts it sends me it just hangs i even called tech support and was told it was a website thing but i think its the app both ipad and iphone versions are broken ugh fail,0
it would seem that one basic thing this app would have would be the ability to view your monthly statements chase must be too poor to afford that option,1
update for the iphone os update so it finally loaded the account activity but i had to turn off wifi and just have it on regular g but it did finally work,1
worked for a while now it wont even log in just says loading for a couple minutes then times out really disappointed,0
use to work now cant log in please fix this issue i receive all notifications of transactions but i cant seem to access my account thru this crap of an app tried deleting the app and redownloading it but useless,0
i use to use this several times per day now it wont let me on very frustrating and ive ended up bouncing checks because i wasnt able to monitor my spousess use of the account,0
i used to be able to log in and at least see my account balances even if nothing else worked now i cant even log in im having the same session timed out issue as everyone else,0
as others have reported this app does not work when connected to wifi appears to be broken since update over a month ago please fix this chase,0
this is awful in this day and age a mobile app is the most convenient way to keep track of finances and this app is the worse one out there crash crash crash,0
unless you do all of your banking on g this app will no longer work for you you cant sign on at all on wifi it has needed an update for over a month but im not holding my breath,0
no issues works great,0
he network connection was lost,0
i updated when everyone else here has and still cant log on i have an ipod touch and it worked fine until the update even after the update today it does not let me log on,0
maybe app has some good features but it still does not work when on wifi ,0
this app is ridiculous it was wonderful when i first got it about a year ago but after the first update it will not log me in and its always crashing dont dl this app its worthless i would give it  starts if i could,0
wont let me log in anymore while in wifi mode only works in g  also updated the app like it said to before  nov and still wont let me sign in via wifi fix this bug asap or i find another bank with an app that works,0
chase has decided that they no longer need our business this is how they will loose a lot of customers everyone knows if it aint broken dont fix it this new app is nothing but a way to have us running to other banks,0
very disappointed they changed app to iphone  amp up  guess they dont care about the people who cant get a new iphone everytime a new  comes out  this was only way i could view my banking,0
you money hungry savages support this app to be available to all the iphone models everything was fine until this update which screwed everything up way to collaborating with apple on great deal of business here againdisgust,0
being forced to upgrade to a version that apparently does not work fantastic idea ill be taking this up with my local branch and not paying my monthly account fees until the issue is fixed,0
i use to be able to log on without any problems i loved it but now can never log on it times out all the time ever since the update it does not work any where please go back to the way it use to be,1
was good i used to use this app all the time but since they force updated it doesnt work and is slow to load will delete it and just use my computer to bank,0
lately every time i check my alerts it will close down the app making me have to log in again,0
i used to be able to do deposits without issue  the last update changed that  the app is pointless for me without this feature working since its the only reason i use it,0
 of the time i cant log in it will just spin until it times out when i do actually get in the same happens when i try to see act details ive tried redownloading the app but the same crap is happeninglame,0
used to love amp use this app constantly to deposit checks now it seems to find an issue with every check without explanation amp tells me to deposit in person soooo disappointed,0
i used to like this app very much its been broken since the last update when i attempt to log on the request times out every time chase phone support was no help at all get it fixed chase,0
stopped working after ios and chases update hasnt worked in a weekupdate  still doesnt work on wifi but it will on gsecond update  still doesnt work on wifi at home i dont think chase reads these reviews and theres a lot of bogus  reviewsnew update  i tried a different wifi which is wep secure and it works great the issue is definitely due to the security level on xfinity i will try some settings and report back,0
consistently crashes when trying to check alerts,0
probably the best banking app i have ever used fast convenient easy to use,0
this only works when my wifi is off took a while to figure out has not worked in months,0
there is no way anyone can review any app if that person cant evn login in the app i have no idea whats going on  but its really hard time login in to the app cant even check my balance n other transactions please please please fix it  ,1
have a chase account but only has a g iphone i cant download the application goz it requires  ios my problem is my iphone can onlybhave  ios i hope apple can fix this so i can download the app on my g iphone,0
once the upgrade went through the app stopped working when logging in it never connects and times out after about a minute highly disappointing,0
the app used to work wonderfully but lately its been timing out erroring constantly spinning and not loading or just plain crashing its a complete waste thought the update from would fix it but it didnt please fix,0
this used to work fine until i updated to the most recent version want to deposit checks on this app good luck as soon as i attempt to take a picture if a check the app closes and signs me out,0
had the app for a long time worked great now cant log on while on wifi dont see why it would have changed all of a sudden ridiculous to have to turn off wifi just to log on,1
this app was a great tool and over the course of months it went down the drain it amazes me that a big company as chase is unable to work on these bugs  i sign on and it keeps loading and loading and loading seriously,0
when i put in my password it wont let me log on it takes forever to connect you but then takes me back to the home screen please fix it was working for me for yrs with no problems before,0
i do not understand why this does not work on wifi i have to leave my house or turn off my wifi to do my banking isnt that the whole point of a mobile app  convenience fix it,0
annoying but it seems to work,0
since up grade to ios  this app doesnt work my citibank app works my capital one app worksupdate to my review it is very clear that wifi doesnt work work around is to turn off wifi and use cell ipod users are out in the cold,0
its okay but the app crashes when i try to use the quick deposit feature when will this be fixed,0
i turned off my wifi and it still would not sign on  i give up im just going to close out my chase accounts completely  if there was an option to give zero stars i would have chosen that,0
bill pay gets stuck when choosing the amount to pay the number key pad gets stuck please fix thank you,1
thank god for the update can use over wifi again,0
first it was the wifi issues and now its bill pay nice update i cant pay my bills through chase mobile and the online version is down get it together chase new it for real,0
i get notifications and then the screen is always blank and i cant read them its very frustrating,0
for me this app is a waste of time i should be able to easily log into the site using the app and pay my credit card please add this feature,0
the app is never accurate about he available balance and present balances the all of a sudden you are unaware about an overdraft the notification doesnt come in on time ridiculous fix this immediately,1
whatever came with this last upgrade this is the second month i cant pay my bill via the app like i used to ive deleted the app until that is fixed,0
depositing checks by taking a pic does not work and hasnt worked for months even with updates the problem still has not been corrected extremely frustrated,0
since the upgrade march  we are no longer able to deposit checksmessage says you are being securely logged on system processing and nothing happens guess its back to standing on line,0
app work great i have never had a problem with it,0
why is it impossible to pay the credit card bill using this app really thought this would have been fixed by now,0
if the issue isnt the required updates over wifi its the limited mobile availability notices that pop up every week as if the  monthly fee isnt infuriating enough cap one  here i come,1
this has not worked for some time and any errors given are too cryptic to understand,0
after every account transfer this app freezes  very annoying  have to delete app and reinstall every time,0
all the other banks are playing catch up as usual chase is the best,0
help can not log on to my account since update also can not save user id  loved chase app but now cant even log on to use it please fix was  star now one star or none lots of users need this app fixed thank you,0
was great but latest version has stopped it from working on my iphone  deleted and reinstalled numerous times but still wont open,0
i love this app but since the last update it wont open after i put in my password just sits there thinking forever please fix very frustrated,0
ever since the update i havent been able to log on ive deleted the app and reinstalled multiple times but it keeps loading  anyone else having the same problem,0
havent been able to log into the system since the upgrade dont fix something thats not broke to begin with,1
it is opening up a black screen no good,0
this app is worthless its great when it works but the check deposit feature rarely works usually have to uninstall app and redownload one would think that a large bank could figure this out,0
when i try to login for quick pay or anything actually it gives me an error message and prompts me to log onto a computer to make payments,0
i have no idea what is going on but it wont let me log in im not sure for how long this has been happening but it is very annoying please fix whatever bug that is not allowing me to log in very disappointing,0
because the app leaves the keypad showing blocking the next button to complete the transaction  this was the only reason i used the app regularly and now its as worthless as a screen door on a submarine,1
the one thing i need it to do it wont read money orders for online deposits chase told me it would but id have to upgrade my phone i did to iphone  still doesnt work and they say oh guess its just not going to work what a joke,0
you can no longer transfer money to mortgages why would you take features away the app is  worthless to me now,0
pay credit card and deposit the check dont work any more that is two function i like before this version now it is gone,0
its really useful ive never had any problems with it i love it i love banking with chase,0
number pad and keyboard wont disappear when trying to transfer money wasnt like that before not sure whats going on doesnt seem to be a way to report it for them to fix it,0
i kind of like it but its a pain to use each time i go to use it it tells me an update is available and i must update for it to work,0
chase has not awoken to os youd think with all the money this bank is making chase would have fixed the numerous bugs that make its app worthless and if you did think so  you are wrong chase is clueless,0
since the update i cant get in ive called and you have said it would be fixed by the last week of september still nothing you are one of the biggest banks in the country how can you not get this fixed,0
always works well best mobile banking app,0
since update app continuously crashes while trying to make remote check deposits as soon as i take the picture if kicks out of the app back to the home screen,0
ever since the update i havent been able to use the app to deposit checks before the update it worked great,0
the online deposit doesnt handle bank of americas account number format on its checks which is pretty pathetic considering the size of boa,1
dont you want me to pay the bill especially since it is late  why would you disable the payment function,1
used to be one of my favorite apps but recently its been darn near impossible to use it to deposit a check please fix it,0
why would you require people download your updates and prohibit them from using the app until then i had issues even downloading the updateresult i couldnt download the update or use the app,1
used to work fine now i have to hold my phone for about two minutes over the check until it thinks im steady enough to take the picture,1
i call chase do dispute unauthorized charges on my account and chase allow to unsurprised peoples use my account without any punishment ridiculous chase i dont believe i was youre costumer for  years,0
ive tried deleting amp reinstalling the app several times have never been able to succeed in depositing a check  for such a big bank the app is a real disappointment,0
this app used to be perfect until the update  please fix the picture check deposit feature so you can go back to perfect thank you,1
i use this app all the time i used to absolutely love it now when i try to deposit checks it crashes all the time when i try to take a picture of the check please fix this app,0
wow what an improvement so smooth well done chase,0
new interface is awesome great job finally received my freedom card as well,0
why do app developers feel the need to constantly change appearances  the last app worked perfectly  wait for the next update to fix bugs,1
this update was much needed thank you,0
really like the new ui design and flow of the app really needed a facelift and this is a job well done,1
just updated app today and its not all thumbs up for me as a senior citizen with older eyes the content is much much lighter and difficult to see the font needs to be a little darker,1
the new update is so so so horrible its just more confusing it has too much going on i dont need my bank app to tell me hello i need to be able to look at the screen and manage my moneyugh i hate it i wish i could unupdate it  hate,1
does everything i need it to do and flawlessly,1
i like the old version the new update seems fancy but hard to read i cant see the checks pictures  please bring this back ,1
the largest bank in the world produces apps that are featureless and behind times the latest iphone app is just a cosmetic change with little in terms of true functionality take a look at b of a apps and learn something,1
used to be easier to pay a bill sign in now slow and takes twice as long,1
it is a great app very good with alerts and easy i really like the design as well overall an awesome app,1
this app is horrible you cant do anything other than check balance deposit checks and transfer money i would love to be able to also stop payment on checks that i have not authorize,1
a great app easy to use convenient time saver highly recommend it  great app job chase ,1
it s everything you need right there,1
great app easy and accurate information,1
never had issues with it,1
excellent,1
i really like this app its easy to use and i like the look of it too,1
always room for improvement but its so convenient i love it,1
so convenient on the go my money at the tip of my hands at all times,1
love this app really convenient and quick,1
i love the new look and layout its very easy to use too,1
very convenient and easy to navigate keeps me on top of my finances as a student,1

its like having my bank on my phone,1

i resent having to upgrade my ios in order to access my chase online banking the app is ok but it was perfectly find before and forcing this change on chase customers was unnecessary and quite frankly rude,1

time when u scrambling for dough,1
excellent very easy and convenient to use,1
please fix need to do my banking when im on the run and dont have a computer in front of me not to mention i need to monitor my accounts please fix update has crashes app wont even open ,0
was hoping the updated version would fix the crash issue  nope tried restarting uninstall and reinstall still getting a blank blue screen for  seconds then quits back to home,0
i have latest version works great as expected i love chase,1
decided i was going to go ahead and bow to technology and use this app instead of logging in through the internet had it for a week and havent been allowed to log in yet awesome work guys really nailed my frustration with this banking juggernaut,1
this app is alright if you just want a balance every time i try to deposit a check on the app it shuts down one of the only reason i started banking with chase pointless now about to just change banks,0
with the new update i no longer can deposit checks online prior to update didnt have this issue screen is black now and doesnt allow me to take photos of check,0
everytime a scan a check i get chase error that picture is not clear enough this is on the iphone s running ios ,0
works fine,0
easy to use very accessible,1
why did you guys remove the text alerts that was my favorite thing about the app please add it back and then youll get your  stars again,0
every time u take the pictures to deposit it crashes pls update im using a iphone s many other people are also having this problem,0
this app works really well but really needs touchid a support no brainer for chase which has always stayed in front of these kinds of updates,0
very clean interface and easy to use,0
whenever i take pictures of the front and back of checks it wont let me tap use or retake and all it does is zoom in i liked this app but right now it is practically useless to me,1
ever since i got the iphone  and i try to use the quickpay option i cant chase app for some odd reason wont sync with my contactsreceipients every time i try to select a receipient it automatically kicks me out of the app extremely frustrating,1
i have the updated ios but a s phone cant deposit checks anymore takes the picture but wont recognize me tapping the use or retake button,0
i had no issues until i was forced to do an update on  and now i can not deposit checks its annoying please fix this,1
it is terribly obnoxious to keep having to update the app almost every time i log in,0
i can longer deposit checks on my iphone since the new update the use button does not react when being pushed please fix this,0
i agree that with the quickdeposit feature not functioning this app is not very useful at all  i have used this app ever since it was first put out and they managed to break the one feature that i use and value most  thanks chase it guys,1
i tried the latest update and am still unable to deposit checks,1
feel like this app is falling a little behind no iphone  support and no finger print reader support need to update this app to work with the latest tech from apple,0
what about transactions can you at least add last then ill rate it a five star,0
great app would be very helpful if i could clear alerts badges without having to log in,0
the big feature of the app was the picture check deposits you guys even advertised for it yeah it doesnt work do you even test your software before submitting to the app store pretty disappointing,0
good app very functional but it needs to support touch id if it gets touch id it would definitely be  stars,0
it seems from this version compared to others there is less information in regards to when payments are due how much is due in order to maximize chase profits while misleading its clients,0
 you should update the app to support the new iphone + display status bar shouldnt be zoomed in and also you should also be able to log in using touch id,1
banking made easy love the app love chase,1
very useful has minor glitches that need to be fixed but once ironed out this app will be impetuous,0
fix this app to accept mobile depositsvery frustrating when the app keeps either crashing when you hit submit deposit or just plain doesnt see the obviously clear check and keeps repeating that the image is not clear enoughget it together chase,1
ive had this app for a while i have been able to just see my balance and thats about it mobile deposits have never worked for me,0
i am not only required to update to the newer version but also ios v i dont have enough space on my iphone to upgrade the os and thats my choice now i cannot use the app at all it locks me out til i upgrade bad customer service chase,0
otherwise a star app it does the minimum of what you would expect from this type of app from this size bank but minus star for lack of touch id support despite many updates since its release,0
i can not access the previous version because it is no longer supported by chase i cant upgrade my itouch  because they havent come out with an update since version something  i feel jypped,1
please make it support iphone  amp plus resolution other than that the app functions just fine,0
its be couple month since the iphone released and chase app still doesnt support iphone  and + resolutions and touch id,0
it would be better if i can use touch id for easy login since they require longer password,0
i cant update my apt due to the operating system of my phone  i do not like the new iphone system and am not going to install it i still need to use the apt to follow my account  you need to keep the old apt active for all iphones no matter the operating system,1
great app but the lack of not using touch id to log is makes it a  star add touch id and it will be a  star app,1
it keeps saying the picture of my check is too blurry to submit the picture looks fine to me please fix,1
this app is not more compatible with devices with ios  like others banks do so i am not able to use it in my devices iphone gs may be apple will let you upgrade,1
if you want an app that tells you very little and doesnt do much this is it glad i kept previous version on my other phone,1
good app but why no support for touchid  why do i have to continuously enter a password  you should look towards the amex app for inspiration,1
after the last update this app started crashing each time i entered my password chase customer support is virtually nonexistent for their app i liked this app a lot till it stopped working completely,1
check deposit doesnt work gives an unspecified error and says deposit in bank this makes the app basically worthless for my needs,1
the ability to paste a password into the login form has been removed so i cant use this app anymore i use password a password manager so i dont actually know my passwords i need to be able to paste it in,1
touch id its the simple things in life that make life worth while,1
good chase bank app nice and easy to use fantastic touch id thank you very much,1

works just the way i need,1
good way to deposit checks saves time,1
easy faster and conveniencebest app ever for banks,0
super easy app very user friendly,0
chase has one of the best user friendly app,1
every time i need to check my account on my phone i forever will get temporarily prut of service thanks for your patience ugh what the hell  why should i even download this retarded app fix it already,1
recommended,1
nothing better than this wonderful app,1
easy straight to what you need,0
great app for viewing balances and doing transactions,0
love the convenience of the check deposit ,1
my credit unions have touch id for log in  when is chase going to implement this,1
will deactivate touch id without you doing it its sooo freaking annoying since i cant remember my password and its so hard to reset password,0
this app is of no use to me on my ipad since it does not turn to landscape mode  so ive deleted it several times and just continue to access chase through my browser andor my windows machine,1
wish it had finger print sign option like bank of america app,1
some password problems aside from that its a pretty good app,1
love this app provides me with everything i need for banking on the go,1
the app is great it is everything you need and it has finger print scanner,1
i have a few different bank accounts with separate banks and this mobile app need to catch up with the times,1
thats right chase is now integrating ads for credit score services and credit card offers into their app not a fan,1
this is very convenient and allows me to delist most checks remotely,1
im loving the ease of this app easy breezy appthanks to the entire team at chase,1
i hate this app i thought i set up automatic payments and then come to find out it was just a one time payment and i get charged a late fee and two payments at once chase is not helpful and neither is this app,1
i hate the way app reviews are setup in the app store,0
perfect and very convenient,0
easy to use fingerprint id is very convenient nice app,0
works well no problems,1
this app is helpful however im not a fan of chase or being held hostageindirectly but im obligated to have an account with them i was also obligated to write this review,1
great app user friendly easy to understand and operate,0
its gets better with every update,0
great app for everything i ever need,0
one of the better apps out there,0
some transfers take some time to show your real balance you can overdraw your account so easy,1
another bank app that makes it hard to log in with too much security making saved passwords unusable when you try to update password app fails,1
oh boy i have not seen any harder rules like this app has it during login please make it easier your job should be to make things easier for consumers and not making their life miserable,1
the app constantly forces me to reset my touch id which constantly forces me to reset my password because theyve made me reset it so many times now that i cant ever remember it if i set up touch id please just let me keep it,1
havent had an issue yet works nicely,1
i like the new design but why the heck am i having bad frame rates the animation is not smooth any more please chase this is not a big d video game,0
looks like chase fired their usability folks and designers the new ui requires many more clicks than the previous this also feels like a web app now instead of a native app serious downgrade,1
this app is missing a touch id option for log in it would be really convenient and if great help if thats added,1
new update is worse mobile deposit is now unreliable and inconsistent this is the only feature i use the app for and now its broken very disappointing,1
the new update wont let me request money but instead keeps crashing and i didnt even update it myself,0
best bank ever no joke ive been through a few banks and chase bank is the best ,1
love chase very easy to navigate and reliable,1

i really like this app is very convenient for me,1
i came to chase because of this app banks are banks but the app makes a difference,1
it works great except for the touch id which requires logging in again,1
let me start by saying  stars is what i am limited to here and that truthfully there arent enough stars in the sky to give this app it is the best thing that has ever happened in mine or anyone elses lifetime the fact that we arent all weeping tears of joy and thanking its creators every morning when we wake up is a shame whenever life gets rough or i think i cant go on i just grab my phone and open the chase app and immediately after i know everything will be all right that blue octagon has become like a symbol of hope and beacon of assurance the ease at which i can see my transactions and click on images of checks i wrote makes up for all the war and violence in the world i mean sure theres still starving people and racism and wage disparity and global warming but when i can use my thumbprint to sign on and pay my bills does any of that stuff even matter anymore no it doesnt the other day a friend told me that i can turn on a feature that allows me to just swipe and see my balance without even signing on  are these programmers actually a higher alien life form that has decided to grace us with their superior technology  id believe it we are living in a golden age folks some people look forward to things like christmas or the season premiere of their favorite show or the day they get out of prison me i look forward to chase mobile updates my excitement becomes palpable as i wonder what wonders will i have bestowed upon me this time the future is bright the possibilities are endless take a deep breath hold on tight and sign on to your destiny,1
love this app very convenient and easy to use,1

love this app,0
it is a total joke amp a waste of time though i was told that i could pay my mortgage using this app i am now being told i cant i already paid with it once they just want you to set up automatic payments,0
how about an app that actually works transfer accounts normally visible via web account access are not available in the app useless,1
also have a number of notifications cant seem to find them,0
works great can access my money all the time,1
this app will not tell you the balance owed on your last credit card statement you know the amount you need to pay to avoid interest,0
it was working great all year now the ap seems to lock up cant seem to get all my info like before whats going on chase,1
i use the app more often to keep tracks of the banking activities,0
please get rid of the red alert after viewing the alerts annoying,1
excellent absolutely the best,0
this app has always run great but after the last update it wont work at all  i log in and it says i dont have any web enabled accounts and i should go unhide them  totally useless app until it is fixed,0
i cant pay my bills any more thru the app with the last update the keyboard gets stuck and you cant enter the amount you want to pay   please fix this asap,0
one of the best apps there are for banking,1

it now forces close when opening notification page it will notify me on screen but when i go in to clear it out it closes on its own  please fix for a better review,0
what else can i say anyone giving this app more than  stars is an employee or ceo  thanks for storing my info for the world to see  closed my accounts and went to my credit union only way to go  bye bye big banks,0
good app to check ur information  need an app for chase rewards,0

i loved my app before the update i have not been able to log on deposit my checks at home or anything for that matter this just makes me want to switch banks  smdh at this app,0
that app recently hasnt been working at all for me it will take a very long time to load or wont load at all most of the time it wont load at all,1
it used to be one of my most used apps since i do a lot of banking but for almost a full month now it wont let me log in  it just times out every time and is totally useless  dont waste your time with it,1
awesome app for chase customers just could use an update for iphone ,1
awesome app i like it crashes sometime though,1
downloaded and went through login process and secure retrieval etc the site always timed out and never would let you log inwaste of time until this issue is fixed,0
i havent been able to use this app in like a month because it times out every time i try to log in its really inconvenient and is messing with my fund management please fix asap,1
this is a great application but ever since the last update my g phone doesnt work no more im unable to check my bank account at all i cant update to the  so now this application its pointless to have on my phone,0
used to love this app but for the past  months or so something must have happened as it always times out and i can never seem to get into see my account info when i really need to fix this chase,0
constant deposit errors since the mandatory update frustrating to say the least this feature is the only thing keeping me with chase and now it does not work,1
the app doesnt work it rarely lets you make it past the login page it times out before logging you in chase is pretty awful as far as apps and mobile service goes,1
simply a bank in your pocket love it,0
works fine on g but always crashes on wifi,0
would be nice if you could schedule external transfers from the app as of now i can only do that from a browser,1
super handy allows me to transfer money and check my balance in real time,1
the whole reason this app would be greatthe ability to deposit checksfails more often than it works total frustrating junk,1
great app but the new update limits check deposits to  this would be great if i worked at mcdonalds but i live in the real world,1
i have had this app for awhile now no problems but it seems like after this last update it went to crap it let me log in but wont let me deposit checks anymore,0
its an okay app i just wish i could use quick deposit quick deposit should be for all types of accounts not just anything above basic fix this seriously,1
rd gen ipod touch users cant update to ios x even though some of us have the same hardware as an iphone gs which can,0
since the last update i havent been able to log in what happened,0
i used this app at the beginning of  on my iphone and it worked great  this fall the app stopped working  it wont log me on  times out every time  i even deleted the app and reloaded it still bombs out  kind of embarrassing for chase,0

love chase and love the app i use it daily multiple times daily,0
i love chase thats it,0
this last update is not saving the user id it needs to be written every time you log on please fix it,1
this is the most useful app i have  great job going above and beyond expectations chase bank,1
needs to be updated inorder to effectively supplement the full website should include the ability to pay student loans improve your app its awful we have to go from the app to the site to pay a credit card and then student loan,0
use it to do my banking no problems,0
this stupid app wont even let me pay my credit card bill the info is there but they grayedout the next button for payment that is the only reason i have this app lame,0
everytime i try to take a picture of a check the app crashes so i deleted the app and tried to reinstalled it to see if that would help but it still crashes,1
the main screen stays blue and will not even bring up the log in page then just shuts off ive deleted and reinstalled several times with no success i dont have trouble with any other apps so idk wut is wrong with this one please fix,1
every time i take a picture of the front of my check the app crashes please fix this,1

the new version is really well design good job,1

hello therei just updated the chase app and now it does not open it keeps crushing  i wonder if there is another update otherwise i will have to check my balance on the regular website  hope there is a new update soon,0
i have been using the app for months now but recently the app stopped working a blue screens shows up every time i open it and crashes after a few minutes please fix,0
the ipad app is pretty good and i hoped this would be similar i spend more time updating than anything else then when i open it i always hope to find actual functionality beyond checking acct balances,0
the mobile check deposits used to work great then sometime in september it never accepts my checks with my iphone  same problem with my iphone ,0
no longer can deposit checks states picture not clear enough the picture is perfectly clear huge inconvenience,0
works well and easy interface one request please incorporate the finger sensor for passcode,0
after the latest update i no longer can deposit checks remotely after you take the photo you cant submit,0
normally this app is really great but the latest version not so much cannot deposit checks with app anymore i am still rocking the iphone s,0
it does everything i need it to do wonderfully,0
this app is amazing works as it should thank you chase,1
ive had this app for years but this new version constantly crashes and all the options dont work please fix,1
i use this app all the time and it was one of the best banking apps  work to deposit checks i cannot hit the use or retake buttons that was one of the best features of this app please fix,1
horrible horrible horrible they need to fix this app asap login takes forever and when you finally get logged in nothing you click on works hurry and improve chase,0
i wish you could click on the canceled checks to see the check images this is one feature that bank of america app has that this one is lacking,1
was forced to update the app couldnt use it unless i updated it and now i cannot deposit checks like the user below me very frustrating please fix asap and send us another update,0
latest update disrupted mobile check deposit which is my favorite mobile feature wont save the check images,0
deposits no longer work with is  after taking a photo of the check the use button does not work  bank of americas system still work great so i am sure it is the app and not my phone  time to switch,1
could this be the review that actually inspires them to fix this thing  i only use it for mobile deposit but now that it doesnt work its a waste of space  another dissatisfied s user,1
every time there is an update something is broken in this app this time its the feature to deposit checks on s,0
nice preview feature  its great need to update for iphone   its still blurry,1
the app is greatconvenient but the amount of updates are annoying,1
it crashes a lot otherwise its okay mostly use it to check my balance,1
as of jan  i can no longer use this app i go to log in it says to update i update and it says to update it is a repetitive cycle that needs to be fixed i have deleted the app and tried again with the same result,1
easy to use amp quick what more do you expect ,1
the update forces users to update their ios to v or later i really dont agree with a service that pushes you to conform your service to best fit their needs chase should have made this update crosscompatible,1
i used to love the chase app but now i cant use it unless i get a new iphone which is not an option kids also used it on there itouch but now its not upgradable  cant we have  versions  one for the old phones,1
please support touch id my password is hard to remember and takes forever to login this app would be five stars if you support touch id,1
one of the cleanest banking apps ive used but yes bringing touch id would be awesome,1

bad app i texted them that a transaction was valid and they still called me twice i already texted them that it was valid too big a company bad customer service also very high fees not a user friendly interface,1
keeps telling me timed out or unable to connect to server try later for any small thing i want to do im impressed by how a big name bank has this kind of product out there,1

very easy and not time consuming,0
simple to use thats all that really matters,0
i dont typically rate apps but i love this one and its never let me down,1

very useful on the road works for me just wish it could dispense cash ,1
it works great for my personal banking needs,1
good app and lets me know instantly when my account is under ,1
takes forever to login and freezes majority of the time during the finger print scanner whoever is the app developer is obviously lazy and doesnt take their job seriously,1
easy to use very convenient,1
useful at times but fails way too often to be considered a  star rating,0
i originally thought it was cause i was trying to do it on a sunday but ive tried it on business days now too and it literally just will not work im very annoyed,1

atm locator is a nice feature  the account interface is not iphone like no good app uses a web page as its interface poor job chase,1
this app is a piece of crap its the exact same thing as the mobile website meaning you cant really do anything this isnt a native app what a cop out to making a real app at lease bank of america understands the future of mobile banking,1
cool find an atm feature but poor account feature same as regular mobile site,1
pretty much the mobile site would have thought with how good chase is they would have someone make a great app but nope,1
need to be able to access chase leisure rewards account,1
perfect  great for those who keep their mind on their money and their money on their mind,1
handy app but id like to be able to save my password also the ability to enlarge text would be nice,1
wherever you are you can find the closest atm or bank with this app,1
highly recommed this app does what it suppose to do easy to use all your accounts on your finger tip,0
no more late payment keeps me uptodate i love the updated features,1
deposit is a great feature well done,0
easy to bill my bill and save paper,1
add how many points you have and the rewards then it will get  stars for me,0
best banking app but cmon give us the retina display and updated icon already,0
no more lines to deposit a check love it,1
always seems to be down for service when i need it aggravating but usefull other times,1
the app works great for me deposits are ready the next business day even went thru on a saturday,1
now with the new ipod touch having a camera please add the capabilities to do deposit,1
thought i would try the revolutionary deposit feature on my gs and the app consistently crashes when attempting to take a picture,0
good app not great quick deposit is a joke has never worked for me,1
i dont know whats going on lately im not able to make any deposit by picture anymore  can u please fix this,1
extremely efficient app and is much faster than my bofa app,0
deposits used to go through but now i get an error every time i have to go to the atm anyway defeats a major point of having this app in the first place,0
i used to love this app and the deposit feature was great but it hasnt worked in over a month i get an error message every time so frustrating i deleted the app entirely,0
works well stable easy interface,0
nice app but it doesnt show you which atms are deposit friendly,0
really convenient and has all the details i need,1
this is a good app use it mostly for check deposit works fine,0
being able to keep track of your accounts is ok but the check deposit feature never works making this app almost useless for interaction,0
i love this app but its acting up im so use to checking my account that im angry now that its acting up,1
this apps the only reason i bank with chase,0
i just updated the appnow im not able to see my personal account even if my settings are right i even double checked online to make sure my account is not hiding please fix this,0
the notification icon will not go away and the app shuts itself down while im still using it other than that i actually like the app,0
dont know why but the app doesnt allow you to see accounts an says they arent online able anymore ummm five minutes before the update i was on my account fix,0
please fix notification alert  can not clear notification even after uninstall and reinstallvery annoying,0
you cant pay bills or transfer money depositing checks is a joke always getting errors end up using actual website defeating the purpose of the app please fix,1
i really like this simple easy fast app from chase works great,0
i agree with others this app use to work perfect and now it crashes every time i try to view account activity please fix,1
app still crashes when you try to view individual transactions in checking account for both iphone and ipad please fix soon,1
this app make my life easier it just work great,0
i have loving this app over the last year or so but this last update constantly crashes its barely usable now im running ios on and iphone s,1
very difficult to manage alerts if you have a few different accounts i wish they would change the way alerts were displayed,1
it was a great app but since the  update the app keeps crashing i deleted and reinstalled and tried all kind of stuff with no luck either roll back or fix it right now cant even use it,1
cant use the app for more than  seconds without a crash doesnt matter where in the app you are have tried deleting and reinstalling as well as restoring my phone,0
worthless  it just crashes as i try to deposit a check whats worse the chase website doesnt support making a deposit with a picture of your check,1
i love this app it is so useful and easy to use thanks chase,0
i got a new phone  days ago and reinstalled this app  now it shows  messagealerts transactionsi dont know what they are  the number looks like your voicemail or sms icon looks when you have messages  what is that,0
nothing fancy but does what is desired,0
have been using  it for a while works excellent,0
this app bugs out every  seconds and this application does not work well i hate this application and chase service through this application my friends use bank of america which is sooo much better,0
a must own works as they said it would,0
i love this app and have used it daily for several weeks,1
this app works just fine,0
allows you to look at balance thats it if you try to open up accountstransfer money or do anything with this worthless app it just sits there loading im a new customer from boa im starting to have my doubts,1
from chases website  quickdeposit is only available on chase mobile versions  and higher to upgrade visit the app storeim at the app store,0
this app has not worked since chases denial of service attack andor since i installed ios  this is a huge disappointment since i have counted on this app so much in the past especially for depositing checks,1
i keep trying to pay my car loan but it keeps saying i dont have a bank account set up yet the payment history shows where i paid it last month,0
ever since the new software came out i cant use this app ridiculous only way it works is off wifi why dont they just fix it already,1
i called  time today for srvice support everybody looks so surprise that is not working  but the reviews are saying and reporting the same problem time  out  come one customer services read the reviews please fix it,0
then next time when you give us an update also give us the option to defer it until later sometimes i just want to look at my account not update your fing software,1
left another bank to bank with chase and used this app turns out it faulty and you get charged late fees because payments arent being processed correctly through the app it worked before but now it stopped,0
hey thanks for the fix hope it doesnt clunk out again,0
why advance program to exclude most customers from getting info about their accounts cant get past intro because of terms maybe new bank can make access easier,0
app wont even let me log in the past couple of days,1
i thought i was the only one having this problem i start reading reviews and come to find out everyone is having the same problemswell so much for being convienient huh ,1
the best and easy and most secure app ever,0
just updated this app yesterday and they still did not fix the problem with logging on in wifi it always times out this app used to be awesome and came in handy but now its just a pain in the buns,1
easy to deposit checks,0
i should have read the reviews first i didnt have login issues earlier the moment i updated to this version im having trouble logging in dont update if you want to use this app,0
love this apphopefully always work better,0
was working great before the last update  cant deposit checks anymore  why do they feel the need to break whats not broken,0
i have been unable to login at all for more than a week disappointed and a huge inconvenience i used this ap more than most,0
the app use to work perfectly until the last update now the app constantly crashes cant pay bills or do anything any more please fix latest update,0
i like this app but i really want to read my secure message inbox from the app,0
i live this bank it has  really good serves,1
there was a time when this app functioned now its only purpose is to check balance their performance upgrades cant even fix the keyboard sticking so you cant proceed with transactions terribly disappointing,0
i rarely go to the back at all anymore thanks chase,0
for weeks now it says it cant log me on something temporary working hard to fix thanks you for your patiencewhat gives,0
they need to improve this as you have to fish around for basic information,0
for some reason it wont log in it gets stuck loading some of my friends have the same problem other than this i love this app i can do everything i need,1
after the last update all my balances reads  and as i can see on pretty much all the other reviews im not the only one its been like this for  weeks now so it does not seem like chase cares that much,0
since my iphone upgrade cannot access my account  i am getting similar error messages as reported by others  i deleted my chase app and now i am unable to reinstall it  fix it,1
since new update i cant deposit checks with the mobile app strong work research and development team way to test your product before releasing it,1
come out with an update app crashes when trying to take picture of check for deposit,1
i do everything though this app no need to go to a bank anymore,1
i relay on the app and alway look out to make sure i dont overdraft and the info given is never accurate i have overdraft more than x because of this im already going to close my account with them asap,1
iphone s camera wont take pictures for mobile deposits i have no camera problems with other bank apps,1
the desktop version is much better than the app the app is way behind boa and discover for example you can not even view a statement get with the times chase,1
change the ui also improvements of the alerts im still getting my old balance notified when im  short currently,1
what a beautiful new app i love it god now wells fargo needs to see this app and realize how outdated theirs is,1
not as user friendly cant find me even though location services are enabled wish i could revert back to previous version,1

good bank nice smooth interface worth the download,0
functions good better than my other banks app good job,0
this is extremely helpful while traveling,0
its great app i love it but can they guide you when you need to find an atm or branch,0
newest update makes the background bright white which is difficult to read please switch back to a colored background,0
since the update this morning the app freezes on the blue screen at launch and then crashes  seconds later before the login screen even loads,0
the app doesnt even open it tries to open it but then crashes all i get to see is a blue screen they did an update and its still doing the same thing on iphone  ios ,0
the last update caused an issue on iphone  this problem is still there,0
i am experiencing technical difficulties using the app to even log into my account completely not a password issue please go a head and try bug fixing once again,1
as of today unable to deposit checks with the new operating system it fails to take a photo of the check it would be nice if chase would fix the system ,0
until you need to send via the secured messaging  i always receive an error stating that the request cannot be completed at this time,0
new ui is good but the app crashes on deposit while taking pictures of the checks i am on ios  no way to deposit please fix,0
freezes all the time i cant even make it past the log in and i didnt realize this until i had to make a payment very frustrating needs to be fixed,1
iphone  plus wont let me connect to app on wifi but no problems connecting over data,1
ive used this app on my iphone s for a few weeks suddenly the check deposit option is not working any longer so now the app is basically useless,0
not a quickconvenient option as apps are supposed to be when you have to download an update every other time you need to access acct info thanks for wasting time,0
had no choice to update app to use now i cant deposit checks the button to accept check after take picture is not working ,0
please see the recent review from deputy below describing the problem with this app  the quick deposit feature wont let the user click use once the photo of the check has been taken,0
does basic things end of november  but still doesnt have new iphone support,0
annoyed like everyone else this has been going on for far too long now it worked great before look at your reviewsratings they are going down hill fast you just came out with an update why was their no fix,0
i like this app but the check deposit feature has been broken for over a month can someone from chase address this,0
still will not allow you to deposit checks with an iphone s unusable,0
touch id login is needed i would use it more if it did to see recent charges is a bit complicated could use an overhaul,1
love this app but with the new update now the alerts on the app icon do not disappear after reviewing them,1
this ap is about as average as the bank nothing special and they go offline a lot of weekends to update chase where average people get average service,0
this app has come a long way since i first downloaded but still needs improvement where is the touch id to log on discover had it practically on day ,1
your new download requires a ios  you state that i can download the last compatible versionnot the last compatible version says its downloading but is not now thanks to your new download i cant get into my account,1
does chase work with iphone to use this app i needs to get a newer phone or delete all my records apple is a scam and it looks like chase is working with them i dont rate this with a single star i had to in order to have my voice heard,1
i would expect that product would be much more thoughtful in terms of when to require a forced upgrade to use the app  i feel like its a monthly occurrence and incredibly frustrating,1
in the several years of using this app quick deposit never works this is extremely inconvenient since the city in which i reside does not have any chase banks or atms now i have to mail in the check to have it deposited in my account this is ridiculous,1
instructed to update app but it wont install on older ios for those who dont get a new phone every year this is a killer i guess i wont be using this service anymore thanks apple and chase,1
the badge alert stays on the app even after viewing the notification,1
good app but please add touch id already so annoying entering password every time you log in make it easier for consumers using your app and you will be golden,1
great app overall but would benefit in a large way with touch id,1
i do all my banking on this app buying wish it supported touchid chase is supporter of applepay which verifies with the finger and most of my apps that require a password support it its just really disappointing,1
been  weeks and still saying temporarily unavailable and to try back,1

helpful and easy to navigate ,1
easy fast reliable good ui what more do you want,1
everything is good except it doesnt have a fingerprint scanner for logging in like wells fargo does needs fingerprint scanner for login,1
all i really use it for is deposits and it is great,1
a must for small business,1
i can check my balance i can pay my car loan touch id would be nice,1
works well for me so far very easy to use,1
never had an issue so far easy to use and very convenient,1

this app is so easy to use and intuitive,1

the best banking app ever very convenient as i am a busy man perfect on the go banking app,1
works well but could be better and easier to sign in if there was a fingerprint reader,1
user friendly can do all my banking remotely,1
i love it its easy access to my account,0
this app makes banking hard and makesme wonder why i have money at chase from its inability to allow password resets to its abysmal mobile check deposit experience nothing is good about this app,1
the app is easy convenient,1
doesnt offer fico rewards etc just payment but it works,0
my tiny little credit union has touch id this is the only banking app i have that doesnt support it yet the token is fairly pointless and can be turned off,1
good  reliable keeps me posted on my bank stuff,1
this app is so convenient and easy to use ,1
does the job pretty straightforward,1
makes banking easy,1
love this app i use it regularly,1
among all the banking apps i have its one of the best,1
annoying that you are not able to get an online customer service link with the app,1
always works well for me convenient,1
hey very helpful app with all of my chase card and account,1
everything works fine but its very basic and limited pretty pathetic for a major card company compared to a mastercard or discover app this is terrible,1
this app does everything i need it to do i am very pleased with it,1
i do not have a complain so far,0
thats all that matters to me i love the app makes my life a lot easier,0
its a good banking app and it should be considering what we have to pay for their services,0
this app is perfect it makes my life so much easier love chase,1
so convenient works smoothly so far,1
i have to reset my password almost every time i use the app and the process is visually confusing,1
works for me have not had any issue,1
love this app easy and convenient i live on this app and it keeps me on point,0
the touch id doesnt automatically populate and i dont always get reminders other than its great,1
its a very convenient and easy app,0
remembers me just enough it allows me to execute transactions safely and securely thats efficiency,0
every other time you use touch id it doesnt work you are forced to type your login info the worst part is it doesnt recognize the password your putting in,0
constant bugs and messages shows the basics like balances transactions but needs more functionality customer service is the worst in the industry,1
newest version of the app constantly forces the user to reset password after restarting the ios device even with touch id enabled and multiple verified correct password attempts,1
delivers as promised,0
its a fine app but nothing spectacular,1
works find easy to use,1
i found the user interface very user friendly and sleekvery easy to use and securejkb,1
have been waiting for a month for a repair to the iphone app displaying an incorrect routing number that you cannot change will not use until fixed used to be a  to  star app,1
app is super easy to use very readable  dont have to go  layers in to get info  ver pleaded with it,1
why does this app wipe out my password every time it updates forcing me to go through the reset password process  very annoying,1
ugh its not convenient when you have to reset your password all the timefix it or i just going to change banks,1
dont bother with this app unless you like changing your password constantly just go online and save yourself the headache that is this app extremely frustrating to deal with and just bad,1
only gets better,1
i love the new format its even easier yet to use this app its great,1
it has its issues i would expect more from a banking app especially from such a large too big to fail one,1
chase mobile is the best thing ever to me,1
easy to use with good info very user friendly,1
this app makes banking so much easier very thankful for this app,1
didactic easy use useful simple,1
at the end of the day it does what it needs and is pretty easy,1
the new update is awesome i liked the old app too but this one is great,1
great app secure user friendly accessing points amp trips could probably be improved,1
its a great resource its fast intuitive and always ahead of the curve,1
its all right ive used better apps like the capital one is way better and quicker,1
quite pleased with functionality and ease of use,1
always works as claimed,1
love this new version,1

very convenient app for usage on go,1

i love love love this app i love the fingerprint entry that is really easy to use and its just in general a great app,1
this is a very convenient app amp a great way to bank,1
excellent fast secure and user friendly application i really like it,1
i been with this bank for years and i love the app,1
amazing and so convenient what would i do without this app,1
excellent very intuitive and easy to navigate,0
intuitive easy to use quick navigation,1
any information that i need is here,1
it shows balance statements and payments but does not show current activity which makes it nearly useless,1
have never had an issue with the app,1
very convenient and user friendly,1
especially with touch sign in,1
very convenient easy to move around in iti love this appmary,1
really good a big reason i bank at chase,1
just great in every way just gets better and better,1
can do almost anything with this app,0
actually not that bad of an app but one star for harassing you for a rating wouldnt be such a big issue but it prevents you from logging in with touch id until you force quit the app and relaunch,0
this app is very convenient and reliable thank you for creating this app,0
excellent app i use it daily to manage my account,0
why is touch id no longer available on my iphone,1
makes life much easier simple to learn,1
this app is quick and easyi love it,1
great credit card management tool,0
this app makes everything so convenient super grateful for it,1
so easy to use so convenient and its all free,1
nice app that is very easy to use and make payments good job chase,1
so im trying to log in i have everything correct and it tells me i need a personal computer to see really i have no computer how am i able to see ugh i hate this app,1
unable to login after lastest update closes after login attempt worked well enough previous to that,1
im very upset i use the touch id for everything and i was using it with the app now its no longer available on my chase app to turn on or off so im now having to enter my password every time i go to get on it,1
can never make a deposit because picture isnt clear im sorry but this app is pointless if i cant even have the accessibility to deposit a check,1
ive seen the capability to search on other banking apps  this is the biggest shortcoming in my opinion,1
awesome ive never had a problem,1
works great for everyday tasks,1
i enjoy the features and information but seems like its down quite a bit,1
the app works great when its not under maintenance but it seems to be excessively unavailable,0
very easy to usebest update yet,1
i really like this app especially the fingerprint entry on iphone,1
use it everyday with no issues,0
rating it because chase wont stop harassing me to rate this app there i rate it happy,1
love it love the fingerprint sign in helps me manage my accounts,1
nothing is perfect but it works,0
its a convenient and easy application  thank you,1
great app i love using it very few glitches works great for me,0
no issues at all very pleased with the app ,1
great app very user friendly supports finger print for easy log ins,1
this app gives basic acct info however it frequently requires password resets and loses touch id settings  which can be quite frustrating,1
love this app and its ease of use,1
best app ever works great the updated one is even better,1
touch id is worthless between app review requests and excessive updates i have to reenter the password nearly every time i open it much faster to look up the password and use the browser,1
clean interface look app works great,1
this app opens well and works beautifully,0
whats the point of having touch id if the app occasionally forgets it and you have to go find your password and spend a minute carefully entering it  that annoyance is what touch id is supposed to avoid no other banking apps do this,1
great app far superior to the one i used to have,1
spending push notifications were very useful and now appeared to be removed this is a step backwards and reduces the usefulness of the app please bring push notifications back,1
so far this app is very useful to me  it is easy to navigate and helpful when doing my home banking,1
quick easy and simple,1
no problems with the app,1
the perfect banking app,1
hard to find what i am looking for not as good as other banking apps,1
works well convenient use it daily,1
does just what it needs to no more no less and it reads great on my iphone ,1
its hard to find things and now its down and i cant deposit a check  chase has the absolute worst customer service and now the worst technology  time to switch banks,1
love chase  wouldnt switch for any amount of money,0
easy access and very detailed,0
easy to use with lots of features,1
i love the chase app it makes the payment process so simple,1
i love this app gives me freedom to do a lot,0
it works great and does everything i need it to,0
its so easy to use and fastthank you chase thank you so much this app is safe thanks,1
very good app saved a lot of late night drives to the atm,0
it does everything i expect it to,1
easy to use,0
love this app no problem for me using it,0
took them a whole  minutes to write this application i only ask for one thing when login in thru safari please dont redirect to the chase mobile sm browser its not useful at all ,1
chase bought wamu forcing me to migrate to their hideous web interface i thought i would try the iphone app in hopes of a better appearance and better features its even worse than i could have imagined,1
when is it going to start working for wamu customers,1
its has the basic things i like that shows the your invest acct too which citi doesnt ,0
you have to have to be registered with chases online banking to use most of this app fortunately wamu customers can still get some use of it the atm locator portion is phenominal,0
the latest update ruined this app you cannot transfer or pay bills anymore it is always temporarily unavailable skip this til they fix it or go back to the one that worked,1
great app works just like a pc i can do everything,0
its been  days and im still not able to view account activity in my checking account please fix this,1
deposit feature is simply amazing,0
i was just told by a chase customer service manager that the deposit feature of the app is not yet available in all areas i live in los angeles ca are you serious chase not available in la and yes the earth does revolve around ca,0
i did the whole image deposit of my pay check and  hrs later it has not cleared  calls to chase and  diffrent stories  i could have walked my check from miami to your main office faster then this garbage,0
when i exit out the app i want it to log me out like it used to this is the dumbest update it does nothing different,1
i love chase and app is good but the push notifications need work  i erased the app and reinstalled and the little red circle is still there,1
yesssss finally able to use my ipod touch gen to deposit a check with the camera sweet,0
do i need a tripod for my ipod do i need professional lighting im still getting a message that my image is too blurry to deposit my check the app told me to take the check to the bank hello useless,1
why doesnt it let you turn flash on when taking pictures of check makes it very difficult to get a good a picture of checks,0
makes my banking more convenient with this app,0
this app is absolutely useless when it doesnt allow you to set up transfer accounts to pay your bill i wouldnt give this any stars but had to choose one,1
i have an iphone  why doesnt this app have a deposit button for me,0
i no longer can check my account activity it just keeps giving me an error,1
awful app  quick deposit does not work  i take perfect pics of check and it reads it as  dollars everytime  well not everytime half the time the app just freezes up and shuts down,0
need to upgrade to include the bank statements so i know how much total balance i owe and not just pay the min payment due how about being able to change the pay from bank,1
i like this app i really do however i cannot use the quickdeposit option why becasue i have no deposits buttonplease help,1
so many great features an easy to use,1
the only reason i downloaded this was to deposit checks by phone since i moved to hawaii and there are no chase banks here looks like im closing my account unless its fixed fastgood thing its free,0
must need app if you bank with chase,0
quick deposit does not work unable to read routing number on check,0
cannot get rid of the red alerts icon when i log in and check the alerts to get rid of the icon it doesnt go away it still says i have them annoying needs fix,1
after last update my phone tells me i need to log in online and unhide account only on phone not on ipad cant view account on iphone fix ot please,1
this app was great and i know it can be fixed i have hope in you chase chase your dreams but no really i log in and try to few my transactions but it just crashes and closes fix it,0
works like a charm i can recommend this to anyone,0
the application crashes each time i try viewing my account balances it used to work great but their recent system updates must not be cooperating well with the app,0
its an pretty good banking app though  it does what you expect it to do,0
i love this app it makes banking so convenient right at your finger tips ,0
when i transfer money from savings to checking it shows up as pounds not dollars,0
when i click on my checking account the app shuts down its been happening for two weeks,0
im able to log in but once i get into my account summary quick pay etc it crashes running on ios  beta so yeah pretty useless other than quickly checking ur balance,0
it was working really well until i recently upgrade it and all of a suddenly when i log on and it shuts off when i try to look at my charges please fix this bug,0
this app is an integral part of my day i couldnt let a day go by without it,1
i handy tool for my phone i like the convenience,0
works terribly since the update if it bothers to display a balance at all it loads until it times out when i try to access my activity forget about performing any other transaction,0
all marketing no execution i doubt that chase spent  of  of what they spent on advertising this junk on actually making it work deleted wont try again as i doubt they can do security either,0
logged in but will take forever to load up and most of the time it wont load very stressful having it wait so long and ends up not loading they need to update their system,1
seriously i loved this app well until about a week ago now that i am unable to log on cause my session some how always times out right away i am completely irritated honestly i am about to switch banks,0
chases very practical and useful app has been upgraded by some vp so that it excludes thousands of otherwise satisfied users i can get a free app that works and free checking as well when i take my money elsewheresomeones mba was not worth a dime not my dime anyway,0
i cant log on it times out every time and i cant deposit checks all it does is load and load then stops and says ok without doing anything its really annoying,0
i keep getting a timed out after trying to sign in the few times i have been able to log in it has been great,0
it doesnt recognize checks for deposit always comes back as error and wants you to deposit check in your bank useless at the moment,0
used the app since the very first iphone the most recent update totally kills the app even after re installation not sure how it works for some of the others,1
it only works when wifi is off otherwise itll timeout every time i try to log in,0
used to love this app for checking my balances on the go but for the last few weeks i cant even log in extremely inconvenient and frustrating,1
i was a long time user and checked my account quite frequently but unfortunately the app keeps timing out chase you need to fix this problem,0
this app does not work on the iphone makes want to go back to my evo better apps  every time you i try to log on it times me out very annoying because i do all my banking through my cell,0
i have need ha issues surprised with the  star ratings given to this app,0
loved the app until it told me i had to spend a couple hundred  on a new phone to keep using it sorry account holders who dont need a new phone better luck next bank,0
the last update definitely screwed this up from preventing payment schedules to making it easier to exit the bill youre trying to pay they didnt do anybody any favors,0
this app does not allow you to pay bills through the app does not give you the option,0
when i try to edit a payment amount with app the keyboard gets stuck and doesnt disappear after hitting the done button so am unable to finish processing changes please fix,1
another update today and the transfer screen still has a bug that wont hide the keyboard so you can actually complete your transfer sad that a company this size cant get their app working properly,0
it wont save my user name it did before but after the update it doesnt save anymore fix soon,0
new update doesnt save my user name and bill pay doesnt work  it doesnt give me the option to make a payment,1
does everything perfectly easy to use best banking app ever,1
dont understand what happened to this app it was good when i first downloaded it but now  that its been recently updated it doesnt allow me to log on i go to sign in and theres a long delay please fix this problem,0
the app keeps saying it is unable to connect to chase and that the problem will be resolved but it doesnt seem to be fixed,1
the app crashed every single time when i took a pic of a checkfurthermore i cant even find out a bug report link from their website,1
my success depositing checks is less than  the feedback to a user on why is worthless tell me why the check is not working,0
i cant pay my credit card bill with this app the next button does nothing when i try to put in my payment all i can do is check my balanceuseless,0
usually i love this app but i keep trying to deposit my checks and it crashes every time i take the picture getting super frustrated,1
my app is taking over  minutes to sign me in i love the banking app but i dont want to wait this long,0
very basic interface for credit card balance and transactions much less functional useful and visually appealing than other bankcard apps,1
gotta wonder about a credit card companys software when it cant even take a payment,1
not sure how good the app is best time will tell for now  stars for tupport team,1
this app is very functional and very easy to use,1
after a disastrous bank error that caused numerous overdraft fees that were eventually all reversed it has disabled remote check depositing due to no fault of my own nobody can reverse this and now its not available for another year,1
great for keeping up to date,1
there needs to be an option to view locations on a map when trying to locate a nearby branch or atm,1
a support rep just confirmed that ipad doesnt have push notifications why not great app but i dont want to have to babysit it to find out whats going on for that reason to me the ipad version of this app is a fail,1
not usable the accounts i regularily use on the website are not recognized by this app this is an old bug not being fixed make this app junk,1
doesnt feel outdated anymore and is just amazing to use and look at great job guys,1
i am seriously considering a change of banks how did this update ever get approved the previous design was functional and sleek with all the information you needed at a glance all on one page this is just horrible,1
finally a decent ios app for banking,1
but way less responsivewish you programmers would remember that you need to be functional first and foremostnot happy,1

the inability to review statements and current transactions makes this app weak the ease to pay bills is nice but id like more access to my account chase being cheap again im not surprised,0
great upgrade love the new photography side menu cleans up the interface  very cool,0
the chase mobil app that you recently updated ever sense you updated this app it doesnt even load up the app on my phone it just sits with a blue screen then force closes an it just repeats it self,0
iphone s version still gets stuck on a blue screen when i try to load the app then after it crashes it doesnt even let me get to the login screen,0
i really hope you guys can update the app for touch id compabillity it would make the whole experience much easier,0
great app works amazing missing one feature touch id it would be so much easier with to login with touch id than to enter cumbersome passwords,0
is there another bank who has mobile check deposits the only reason i have chase is for this feature which doesnt work  of the time,0
iphone  plus update enabling touch id login such as discover did would be great,1

this is the third deposit cycle where mobile chase has been unusable for me and my iphone s,0
this update is crap functionality is nil you can log on amp thats about all screen freezes amp you cant even get into bill pay or anything else log on log off thats all its good for,1
ever since the update the check deposit feature doesnt work the accept button seems to be behind the photo so they need to fix this,1
since i upgraded software to ios  i cant make deposits  the imagine button to approve copy of check taken does not seems to work i get stuck in the middle of my deposit please fix bug,1
having same issues as everybody else cant deposit my check not that big of a deal for me cuz theres chases all over my area but still chase get your act together,1

i use it very often well done,0

no complaints simple easy and does what i need in an app good job chase,1
handy informative and most of all user friendly the only thing missing is touch id access for iphones,1
good app for checking my balance,1
great app to handle your daytoday finances onthego,1
asking to rate this app is messing up the timing of touch id trigger event  so far havent done that many operations using this app,1
this app is just as essential as my morning coffee,0
this review is based off chase as a bank i cannot support anything about this bank over their funding of the dakota access pipeline i have closed all accounts and will be deleting the app once i post this review nodapl,1
this has helped me out so much and if i ever had a problem apple comes to the rescue,1
loving the chase app,1

great app very fast and convenient,1
nice and cleanly organized should add some features for home refinancing etc,1
love this app makes banking super quick and easy,1
i hate that chase doesnt have one touch access it is so time consuming to keep putting in your password over and over again,1
fantastic well done easy to use,1

easy to use accurate no glitches,1
love my chase app its very easy and convenient,1
user friendly convenient reliable,1
good stuff no complaints,0
i love it  very secured and fast and easy to manage my finances ,1
this app is similar to the other back apps out there,0
the notifications i get from the app are super helpful i love it,1
functional but thumbprint identification like other bank apps would make this so much better,1
never had a problem,1
almost all my banking is done on the app very convenient ,1
this app is half useless to me because the deposit check portion does not work   bring back the previous version,1
great app but most weekends that you need to do your banking stuff from home is unavailable,1
i use chase app all the time to deposit checks great app,1
easy to use and no issues transferring,1
the old version was soooo much better please change it back i liked the finger print login much better now i have to remember a password from the many i have,1
easy to use,1
overall its not bad but the frequency of problems making a deposit makes this app frustrating,1
they take to long to take out tips off the account fix it,1
hands down the best banking app ive used by a long shot,0
any banking app should have finger print validation  this app is way behind to standards,1
i like this app for paying amp monitoring my account,1
extremely responsive and easy to use love it,1
great appsimple and straightforward works extremely well,1
great app to manage your accounts and monitor transactions,1
i dont use all the features of the app but the changes have been pretty good,1
i love it does everything i need and more,1
makes banking very convenient,0
good very good  easy to check my balance,1
i like the touch id to open the app,1
this app needs touch id and easier access to points information paying the bill is easy but hey thats the minimum,1
handles my racks well just asked to many times to rate this app,1
good app easy to use but it needs touch id login to get five stars from me,1
very easy and fast  love the finger print identification system,1
awesomely easy ap  it does everything i need it to do,1
it will be better if there is a touch id log in,0
good app but needs more improvement,0
i love having easy access to my account,0
ive liked this app for years new version only shown transactions since last statement unless you do a multi step search this dramatically reduces its utility now i dislike this app bad job chase,0
easytouse seems to work flawlessly,0
works well no complaints,1
decent,0
easy to setup and easy to use what more,1
this app is very well set up and super convenient,1
this app has been great i havent run into any issues,1
very user friendly app only wish it had thumbprint signature,1
no other app requires that each time the app is updated the user must login to the website and reset login permissions to allow touch id otherwise the app is serviceable,1
waste of time  keeps locking me out and make me reset my password  not user error  i use two other bank apps and have had no issues  will be using the internet from now on  what a useless app,1
mobile deposit never worksannoying advertisements cannot access account due to needing update but theres no update available,0
you have to be connected to wifi really whats the point of making a mobile app of you have to be connected to wifi ridiculous,1
just downloaded and wont let me open because it says it needs to be updated  youd think large companies could get their ht together with sensitive data,1
would love to see a fingerprint to log in option,0
just as my title states this app is garbage the latest problem i am having is it will not let me update my password i even came up with passwords i have never used before and it still informs me i need to follow the guidelines,1
by far the best official bank app ive had keep it up,1
everything at your finger tips works great on my iphone,1
great app i can do all my transactions securely on my phone great job,1
dont have any problems with it always reliable,1

very convenient and never any problems,0
awesome app user friendly saves me so much time  safe and secure,1
used to be nice to do banking on this app every screen now has a pop up linkad super disappointed that chase bank has allowed this need to reconsider my banking options,1
very helpful app helps keep me on track,1
peace of mind rest people can understand,1
the app does what i need it to do,1
its the best mobile bank app that i have ever used,1
makes life a little burn more manageable,1
great app great bank with awesome customer service,1
very helpful app that is user friendly and secure,1
very user friendly and accessible,1
i use this app to do my banking and i dont appreciate having to see intrusive popups that interfere and distract me while working with my finances you need to hire a user experience designer or users will start to flee,1
thats it,1
this app is a life savor i can manage my finances in a heartbeat ,1
i have no complaints about it i like it and its good so far,1
advertising now  great this app and bank are history,0
i love this app chase proves itself once again,1
easy to use and love the alerts,0
this is a great application feels like baking from my phone,1
nothing fancy does what its supposed to,1
its very easy to use but why did you remove preview balance without logging in total failure,1
with the updates its gotten better thanks,1
very nice upone thing i noticed is that it displayed the whole number of deposit from accountthere should only need the last  numbers or somethingthat is just my opinionthank you,1
would love to have the touch id feature to login which is safer than putting in a password,1
works very well for i havent had any problems with it,1
find this app helpful in managing finances efficiently,1
doesnt retain settings constantly needs me to put my fingerprint in if i enter my password wrong just once it needs me to reset it,1
its a convenient app to have and  i havent had any issues,1
rarely works on the first try often have to close and restart the app multiple times just to see my account doing anything once in the app is often laborious and ultimately futile,0
probably my most used app   love the ease of it,1
great app very convenient but goes down almost monthly for maintenance,0
the application does a good job and it shows me what i want to see good job overall,1
mobile deposits rule app simply works,1
great,1
the pw reset process is highly confusing and sometimes cumbersome plus i feel i am using the right pw and i have to reset,1
easy to use i liked,1
this app has basics covered but its amazing to me that it doesnt have functioning touch id capabilities like amex does hard to see pending charges,1
i really like the chase app  it has everything i need at my fingertips,1
the app is very friendly simple and clear,1
doesnt clearly distinguish necessary fields to fill in color not optimal limited functions without first setting up on computer,1
great app hasnt given me any issues very easy to use,1
no touch id surprisingly hard to get to the page to make a paymentno or not easy to find  all transactions  set up international travel notices  reward balance,1
easy to use this app makes banking on the go a snap,1
great banking app havent had any issues absolutely love it,1
works well much improved applicable and useful simplicity,1

you can conduct all banking aspect from the app great,1
i like the features the chase app offers,1

this app is so bad that you cant even give review worst banking app uploading check is a pain it fails more often than any other banking appneeds to be updated every time i try to use ittry giving review and it will say nickname is taken so what  well it will erase your review and ask you to type all over againcant they pay  extra to get a good appother banks dont have this problem,0

i downloaded the app to alert chase that id be traveling out of the country  no luck  app did not support that basic feature,0
every month when i try to log in to pay my bill i have to reset my password and its not as simple as answering a security question or two,0
very convenient,1

the funny thing is it was fine for a year and now its terrible ive been locked out of my account  times in the last  months please fix this chase,1

i downloaded this app to be able to make my car payments on the go but it doesnt even let me make transfers whatsoever  out of  stars isnt an option or thatd be my rating,0
this app was great with the old software but ever since the update it loops me through the we dont recognize this device deal i have deleted it from my phone because it is worthless to me now,1
it doesnt recognize the device after os  and worse it keeps pushing you back to the login screen this is not exactly a well designed app as it is without it not working on os ,1
cant sign on cause my wamu account hasnt switched to chase yet,1
we need a feature so that we can make deposits online using the iphones camera just like this other banking app in the app store so we dont have to go to the annoying out of service atms,1
why not include information on my account benefits so i can look them up while on the road,0
i love being able to do my banking on the go,0
it has everything exept i cant see my reward points would be a five star if it had that,1
take a look at discover card mobile site for how it can be done another reason to prefer discover,1
i tried with three different checks and could not get this to work on any of them,0
this app and very simple game i get good use out of,0
as mentioned by others this problem is back with the latest version   dont they test these updates,1

works just as advertised and simple ad easy thanks,1
y wont it show the deposit thing on the bottom for me,0
good app i enjoy most of the features but my only problem an annoying problem i cant do quickdeposit what the hell there is no tab for deposit unlike the misleading screenshots,1

this is a must have app for iphone users,1
this is no doubt the best app ive installed recently,1

no option to deposit check with photo,0
i wanted this app just to deposit checks feature shown on tv my app never has the deposit tab at the bottom its not even an option it is updated i have an iphone ,0
great app i use it all the time,0
i love how the alerts work out for me ,1
the check photo tool is useful but its hard to see what activities have taken place it cuts the name of the transaction off crashes often,0
this is so easy i highly recommend it to anyone,0

great app works quick and easy,0
this is definitely more interesting than i expected,0
you cannot complain,0
ive held off on the update due to the terrible reviews thinking chase would get it fixed before i updated unfortunately im having the same problems without updating come on i loved my app not anymore,0
only way to make app work is to turn off your wifi on your phone no matter the model s quick fix until chase devs find and fix the bug,0
i havent been able to get onto my account from my iphone g for weeks now im ready to delete the app its frustrating because it was such a help when it worked,1
i can see the details of my auto loan but cant pay it it says you currently do not have any transfer accounts available this makes the app completely useless to me am i missing something,0
needs an update to the screen size of the iphone ,0
this app used to be wonderful i did all of my banking on my phone i moved and now it times out on a comcast wifi please send out an update that actually fixes this problem as i used to love this app,1
app is garbage since the last few updates all it does it sit on the loading screen after trying to log in and then it just times out app is useless,0
i can not log in via this app since the latest ios very irritating for me and embarrassing for chase same problem for my wife and even co workers from what i read everyone has the same issue,0
hasnt worked since last upgrade login attempts keep failing  only works when connected to lte never able to log in when connected to wifi,0
app crashed when i submit a bill payment as soon as i press submit happens every time other than that works great,0
since the update i have only been able to log on once  before the update everything worked loved depositing from my phone please fix it,0
i keep getting the error above and its annoying i cant log on to check balance this is my only credit card app that gives me this kind of trouble,0
only good for two things bill pay and mobile check deposits the latter constantly crashes fix this crap,0
i like how transactions are displayed now with the newest update,0
capital ones credit card option is more specific and easier to use  the app needs more details and specifics,0
mobile deposit hasnt worked once reads checks wrong cant move forward takes forever to connect if at all schwabs app is great  i guess just one more reason to switch to schwab,0
stop updating this app leave it the way it is every other day is another update,0
this app worked great before the update cant make a credit card payment now,0
this app used to work great i could check my balance transfer money even deposit checks from my ipod touch now it wont even let me log in they need to fix this app,1
let us c our balance for our credit line available for credit cards and a payment due dates for all cards it will help alot with spending,0
what are you guys doing to the app wrong balance every morning at the same time just got declined because i cant transfer money from savings into checking every weekend its getting an update worst banking app,1
this app would be nice if they werent always doing maintenance on the app its almost always a let down when i need it the most im better off wasting gas to go to a chase bank than wasting my time with this app,0
i deleted the chase app and reinstalled app in hopes of being able to make a payment but does not work,1
every time i go to take a picture of my check the application crashes ive deleted and reinstalled the app many times now and its still a problem fix this,1
i use this app constantly but for the past few days its been down amp gives an alert when u try to log in saying it will be back up asap its been days so please fix it,0
this app makes me want to leave chase as a bank if they cant handle a banking app not sure i want them handling my moneycrashes along with all the other complaints users are listing,0
two updates ago payments to my credit card ceased to work  i travel for work so i have to find wifi log on with my laptop and do it that way  remind me again why there is an app fix it chase,0
app works ok but it requires an update almost once a week chase needs to test before they put out a new fix,0
i havent been able to sign in for about two weeks it is getting really irritating since i use the app for so much i can sign on through the internet but not the app,0
very easy to use an convenient,1
used to love this app now every time i try to log in since i got the iphone  it says chase is temporarily unavailable try again later and this is going on now for weeks please fix asap,0
i was pleasantly surprised by this app i use it daily and love the features it  gets better and better,1
every time i take a picture of the back of the check it crashesthis is extremely annoying,0
please make it easier to read alerts less steps to get to them,1
great,1
chase youve update has screwed up your app now i cant make my payment any more when i called in they sayed they were getting many calls on this,1
the app crashes and shuts down every time i take pictures for deposit used to work well but not now,1
serious bugs random crashes when making deposits very frustrating,1
my app does not allow me to pay bills even i update already it says temporary not available almost a week now not happy about it,1
its ok could use a little polish and better presentation this app could learn a thing or two from the likes of amex for presentation and capone for that handy pattern recognition login feature,1
looks great and the app flows beautifully now good update,1
tried several times to deposit a check and it crashes before i can take the front pic very frustrating and disappointing,1

very easy user friendly in amp out banking transactions ,0
funtional and really friendly interface,1
im in love with the new update great user experience thanks for the miami background image,0
wonderful,1
going to the bank with this app is like a dream out of a stark trek sequel,0
i updated this morning then click on the chase app amp all i get is a blue screen for about  seconds then it crashes i uninstalled the app amp reinstalled it the issue is the same,0
i came here to read the reviews because my chase ap is broken all of a sudden it is true i am experiencing the issues all others have blue screen no option to log in,1
chase broke the app for me it used to be great and now with the latest updates my phone wont even get to the login page way to go chase you guys dont know how to test on multiple devices,0
i dont like it much i always have trouble with requesting money,0
currently app is not opening at all immediately closes itself i reinstalled the app to see if that would fix the problem but it didnt please resolve this immediately,0
had chase app for a couple of years and after upgrading to the mention version above the app wont even open remove it tried to redownload it and still the same,1
it seems like all my quick pay transactions are going through twice i have to tell people to decline one transaction and accept the other,1
awesome but when i updated it no longer opens sigh,0
was forced to download trying my best to get old version back gave it a  because couldnt give a zero have been stuck at checkout on several occasions unable to access account to transfer help,0
looks like discover app has the touchid incorporated into their app id love it if chase did this to make logging in easier and faster,0
cant deposit checks or see secure messages  mobile deposits are important to me  thinking of changing banks to have this feature again  please fix soon,1
did the update and now i am unable to do mobile deposits i can take the picture of the check but am unable to click use image,1
i rare go to the bank anymore i basically do everything on this app ,0
literally does not even give me the correct balance awful also alerts are saying that im approaching credit card limit when im not get it right this is ridiculous,0
how use this app mostly to deposit checks i just did the most recent update and now like others have mentioned the deposit check portion doesnt work,0
the key tap input for the check review page of quickdeposit is being captured by the photo double click feature as a result you can not use the photo,1
love the app but now i cannot deposit checks i cannot click the use or retake buttons,0
great update couldnt ask for more,1
why would you require one log in to say they need to upgrade the app after which one needs to log in again,0
one reason i stayed with chase was my ability to remote deposit my checks latest version broke this function maybe its credit union time disappointing,0
maybe if enough people give it lousy reviews theyll finally fix the major glitch of not being able to deposit checks,1
still awaiting the upgrade for my iphone+ larger screen your app is the only left that i use daily that hasnt upgraded yet ,0
works brilliantly i havent physically visited a bank in years thanks chase,0
i just updated and now every time i log in to make a check deposit when its in the picture screen it closes out please fix,1
i just updated my chase app have been disappointed with the minimal abilities of the previous appwas hoping for abilities such as monitoring deposits payments past months etc as well as balances transfers and paymentsjust like the ones i use at other banks nadatil chase catches up or surpasses competitors for convenience my usages will be minimal the ppl rating this app as good amp simple obviously havent used others betterwamu was bad chase is not demonstrating improvement,1
unless i upgrade my ios which i cannot do the app no longer allows me to use it what the hell it still launches and was working great until last week it wont let me use it now please fix this,0
i love this app but i wish touch id for logins could be utilized i can take advantage on the discover app rbfcu app but not this banking app yet,1
i wish the ability to use the previous version was left alone i can no longer use the app on my older ipod oh well it was a fun couple of years anyway back to the bank i go,1
does the job well quick deposit is awesome,1
you cannot access the old app by a forced upgrade message and you cannot upgrade to this new version due to ios upgrade restrictions,1
for the past several weeks ive been trying to use my app as i have been doing and it just doesnt work  it wants me to update but it doesnt let me do it  so im back to making payment with checks ,1
best consumer friendly app by any us bank user friendly and very slick,1
quick pay is anything but quick takes til next business day but didnt start that way very slow called  plus times to fix it  ugh no help,1
the app will not work without an update  the update requires   my iphone gs cannot be upgraded to   app useless for me and i cant even log in with the old app do do any of my banking at all its a bit annoying,1
i like the app but it is definitely time to integrate touch id,1
this app needs to be optimized for the iphone  and iphone  plus its really not the greatest,1
was looking for a way to report a bug couldnt find anything so i have to leave a review i could log in this morning but i couldnt download a statement now its not even letting me log in,1
woo hoo touch id  the only thing this app was missing now its perfect way to go chase,1

awesome need to add fingerprint access then you are in real business,0
while i enjoy having this app available to me quickly at the touch of my iphone the point is having it on my iphone means i want access to it fast  of the time i am required to update the app after ive logged in already logging in is not easy with the tiny buttons on the iphone i have a complicated password for security reasons of course so logging in  times months before the update and again after should not have to be necessary they need to make the app so that if an update is required that notice to update pops up  before you login and as soon as you launch the app this has been my biggest annoyance with this app we live in an i want it now world and chase needs to keep up with that if i am trying to get something quickly and have to wait for an update i will move on to the next task in my mental list to do and then i forget to come back and then i get more frustrated since there was a pretty good reason that i needed to get to the chase app in the first placei realize that since it is a banking account at chase wants to keep the app as secure as possible and im sure that those are security updates so i can appreciate that but just to tweak that a little bit to make it happen before you log inaside from that the app has met all my other needs i love how you can deposit  a check with the app and dont have to go the bank i seldom need to go to the brickandmortar store anymore to do my banking,1

this app used to work but for the past month when i try to log in it goes to a blank blue screen i even deleted the app and redownloaded it and it still does the same thing fix it please,1
push notification will not go away,1
new update is is a bust cant remove alerts also unable to view my external accounts on mobile only desktop which is useless if i need to transfer funds,1
this used to be the perfect way to keep track of my accounts on the go now its just frustating having a constant alert and theres nothing there make it go away now i had to delete the app because its drives me crazy,1
i updated to the newer version and just cant seem to deposit a check i wish i could roll back to older version,1
works perfectly for what i need,0

maybe chase is in more trouble than we thought if we cant even see our money in our accounts please fix the login issue soon it looks fishy,0
i havent been experiencing the log in issues but seriously update for iphone  already,0
this app completely does not work on my iphone  it worked five on my droid but it wont even let me get past a log in annoying looking forward to an update,1
choose a smaller bank small banks have apps that work just as well offer just as much security and you dont have to update it every time you try to use it,0
cannot log into account for days always loading but times out before it ever loads or my phone auto locks please fix it i used to use this app everyday,1
shuts off when i take a picture of a check for deposit  ugh,0

since the update i cant log in i try daily and once in a while im lucky but then the next time no dice whats going on with the spotty usage abilityplease fix i dont want to change banks ,0
what happened to this app  chase claims to be so technologically advanced  the app crashes and no longer allows me to deposit my checks via camera phone  bah humbug,1
overall its a great app  however it pushes random alerts every day that can not be turned off they are so annoying not cool,1
this app used to work just fine and i had no problems making depositsnow it just times out and doesnt do anything its very frustrating please fix this asap,1
ridiculous that the new update will not work on the iphone chase you are being very short sighted and not customer friendly once again only thinking about yourself,0
why would you update an app and make it not work on customers i pod making the customer buy a newer version of i pod  does someone at chase make money when new ipods are sold,1
enjoy this application very convenient for banking,0
used to work great after updating it wont let me login i have a s but it tells me i need to upgrade my software to the  in order to use their app just because my iphone software is months old ridiculous,0
finally works,0
hardly ever works wont even let you sign in because the request always times out even after the update,0
no message contact options  no option to view messages through app  still need to log into site for that,0
it only works when it wants to  when i first downloaded this app it worked fine  now it tells me theres an error with this deposit  please click ok to try again every time,1
amazing app time saving and so efficient,0
i love this app i use it everyday however you have to update it way to much,0
best app  really simple and straight forward exactly what you need ,1

i cannot log on to the app and chase doesnt allow regular website logins from my phone terrible no way to track credit card activity ,0
easy to use for banking but atmbranch locator quit working for me which is a drag when traveling,0
its been about  months since the last time i was able to deposit through the app always showing an error message,1
since i updated about  days ago the app crashes every time i take a picture of my check please fix quickly,0
one of my most use apps on my iphone   its very helpful,1

needs updated to iso  not  being able to use is a huge innconvience and im tired of the error report every time i try to log in i use this app daily and now i cant check anything is not cool,0
help,1
it is jawdroppingly stupid of these guys to release an update with such a major and obvious bug as the inability to accept a deposit  but they did it  morons  one of the very few features that was actually very useful  so lets break it  unbelievable,0
very convenient,0
ever since updating i am no longer able to so online deposit via my phone  all the check images i take get rejected by the app   awful now,1
with all these comments that the app is broke like mine how long does it take to fix we havent been able to log in for weeks do you people care or are you just incompetent,0
this app is a gas saver i never have to set foot in a bank with this app it can do it all,0
this app is a great reason for me to go back to bank of american forget depositing checks using a picture app crashes each time a photo is taken i deleted reinstalled and no difference chase is a waste,1
versatile app missing one critical piecethe ability to transfer funds to external accounts,1
previous versions of this app were very useful but current version will not take pictures of checks under any conditions rendering the app useless to me,1
very good app with the new redesign much more user friendly and smoother ui,1
the latest app update looks very cheap its a downgrade from the previous more professional look  wish i could go back to the previous version sorry i upgraded,1
love the new update about time,1
app is nicely designed however it crashes for me all time after i loginquick fix will be appreciated,1
this new app from chase is horrible  i have managed to log myself out accidently because of how they placed everything  i may need to go elsewhere  i loved the previous version  it was simple and easy to use,1
well done much improved,1
yet another upgrade to white space at the expense of having room for actual content old app was better this is not an improvement,1
why did they change the interface i dont like that i cant see balance after every transactiondont like that i cant seem to write emails to customer service overall the interface feels difficult to navigate please change to the old one maybe hire razorfish they cleaned up tmobiles website quite well recently,1
works oknot a lot of glitz or flash but it does what it says i prefer the desktop version,1

app works well for what i need it to do balance checks and remote deposits,0
the app is really convenience with a new look,0
very well designed app and works well,0
very clean and modern the functionality is excellent as well,1
this app needs to include ability to search history of past activity of account,0
gets the job done well and cleans up nice,0
it does what it should and does it well,0
the feature i want the most see transaction history is not existing,0
wouldnt change anything,1
love the convenience was easy to learn,0
since the new update for the app came out i havent been able to log in it keeps crashing i have even tried removing and reinstalling the app but still crashes,0
i cant deposit a check through mobile one of the main reasons i use the app for i have the s and it kicks me out every time i try to deposit a check,0
tried reinstalling wont even download now says its available for download yet when i click download it just shows the same message over and over,0
sad to say the app has been crashing on me lately i would log in and as soon as i click into a account the app closes on me now i have to resort to my computer to do any transaction of any kind sad,0
great app and so easy to use get it and you wont regret it,0
ever since the ios  update i can no longer deposit checks from my phone it says the picture isnt clear but i can clearly see the check,1
with this new update im unable to make a deposit i get as far as taking a picture of the front of the check then neither the retake or use buttons work,0
what happened i use this every week and now suddenly i cannot get it to deposit checksthe use and retake buttons no longer work at all,0
i cannot deposit a check  the use and retake buttons have become nonresponsive it is completely unusable in this version,0
this app does what its supposed to do and no more i dont understand why people rate this app below  stars,0
navigating this app is like playing darts  takes multiple attempts to actually get what you want its exhausting  making deposits no longer works for me  im making more visits to the bank now terrible app,0
hey chase mobile app folks the deposit use image button is useless i can take the picture but i cant use it i cant change my phone maybe ill change my bank,0
new update freezes up about  of the time check deposit feature is messed up as well please correct and update soon,1
i have the iphone c and ever since the big update to the app the deposit a check feature does not work the camera blacks out and you cant take your pictures,1
cant deposit a single check with this app  stop working on the looks and feel  just get the basic features to work,0
the quick deposit option literally nonexistent its nowhere to be found on the menu i have iphone s,1
great app the only problem i have is that i cant use touchid to log in other than that love it,1
i dont bank with chase but i have  credit cards with them this app does not support credit card access only thats just wrong,1
the new update makes it so you have to have the iphone update i dont have a phone that will allow me to have that update so now i cant use the app,1
ive got an older iphone that works just fine but unless i buy a new phone the app that i used at least a dozen times a week is useless amp im just sol i guess my bofa account will be the new goto thanks for nothing chase,1
if you have an iphone s apple does not suggest updating to the latest software however the chase app requires it not happy about this and would appreciate chase fixing this,1
this app requires an update every other month and now telling me i need iso  ugh it worked great if i didnt have to update the app every other time i try to use it,1
terrible update doesnt work always crashes called customer service and they are terrible i am switching to anther bank after  years with chase,1
my favorite banking app the update makes banking so much fungreat app,1
gets the job done i can check my accounts all that matters,1
 optimize the display for the new cant believe i am using this word here iphone  and  plus long overdue implement touch id the alert numbers need to automatically disappear after logging in and out just like before,1
touch id is perfect for this app but for some reason it hasnt been implemented yet come on chase accessing the app is the worst part,1
all you need now is touchid support and it will be perfect,1
please add support for the password extension for quick password logins and for newer devices please add the option for touchid login,1
its pretty great the only downside is that on the weekends it isnt always accurate especially on sundays,1
touch id  years after it came out,1
with the addition of touch id  this app is now even better,1
this is a beautiful app and works very well,1

overall okayi would like to see my daily balances along with the transactions,1

overall this is a good app but what is the point of having fingerprint id if you still have to enter a password to do anything,1
this app is great i love how easy it is to deposit checks,1
i dont understand why chase justifies its new update with placing an ad on user sign in page i dont want to be marketed i just want to check my account and not see any ads to it very upset with the new update,1

helped me out a lot dont have to hassle with a website,1
you need this app,1
i was approved for ritzcarlton credit card and received my activated card  and when i tried to use it card got declined called in was on hold for long time and then was told my card is closed  what a waste of time,1
i have nothing bad to say about this app and the company,1
when you advertise a big giveaway such as the eric clapton album then you dont provide access or respond to the question what happened you deserve less than one star,1
everything about this app is amazing ,1
it should be worth  stars but wont stop asking me to rate it so you lose one star for being needy but over all a good app thanks chase,1
this app crashes right after log in it works for a while after i delete and reinstall but it fails again after a while,0

chase is efficient and app works well,1
im about to give the same review as old posted ones why come up with an app that doesnt work  i tried logging on to view my acct info but the timer just kept spinning thats no good,0
all this does is take you to a poorlycoded terrible looking web page with your account info chase can and should do better than this its lazy and its deleted from my iphone,0
get kicked out when i try to access my business accounts also says it cant connect when i make transfers i like the improvements but only if they work,0
i like being able to pay my bills on the go,0
maybe i just havent found it yet but i need to see my chase credit card due dates,0
would love to see check deposit scanning like the usaa app  great app love bill pay,0
worked first try amazing app will save lots of time,1
this app is great,1
its ok just need to have a place where u can view your messages or alerts,1
the push notification badges wont go away need to fix it asap also need to be able do more than just see your reward points,0
this is an essential app for all chase customers mos def recommend it,1
after updating app it does not work properly unable to view checking account transactions,0
it said you can make depostits to your account but you cant thats the only reason i got this app and it doesnt even work its a useless app,0
wont take picture when trying to deposit checksboo  therefore this app is nothing special,0
sometimes the scanner works sometimes it does not also there may be server issues because chase does not receive my info sometimes,1
beware of the upgrade on deposits the app crashes trying to open the camera,0
the app is so so but nothing special t only part of the app i have a desire to use is the check depositing which has never worked for me major bummer,0
this is great but where did the deposit go i just downloaded it and it is not on there so dissapointed,0
please have this app available for windows phone thanks,1
chases app used to impress me but for the past few months the deposit feature has never worked it is insanely frustrating,0
would like to be able to do transfers on app from chase to external accounts and vice versa,1
i loved this app until recently when i try to deposit a check it says cannot connect to chase its been three days now and i still have this problem help,0
alerts badge wont clear is anyone checking these updates before release,1
cannot deposit checks with app currently does not allow you to type in the amount on the check,1
great app  user friendly bugfree very helpful,1
has the deposit option been removed temporarily until the issue is resolved thats the main reason for this app,1
this app was fine until the update and now its totally useless the keyboard wont retract once you pull it up then youll find yourself using safari to login chase great job in making the app worse,1
just got the new update and havent been able to log on since  it was working great before,1
when a pushed alert comes there is no indication about which account triggered it one has to go through accounts one by one to find it stupid interface,1
i love and use this use app all the time,1
need to fix the check deposit feature it never recognizes my check and doesnt deposit in my account,0
quick and easy to use,0
dont even bother with this crap just crashes also cant deposit through picture as it keeps saying hold steady when the phones not even moving useless,0
i use it all the time,0
great job and keep up the great work ,0
its one of the few apps i use every day,0
this is a really good app,0
very nice everything works on my s,0
this app was great and now it is simply stunning,0
normally love this app but its not letting me see my activity  keeps saying no activity at this time  please fix asap  i rely on this thing,0
all you need to do in your fingertips,0
this app doesnt work anymore and chase mobile doesnt work on safari either get it together and give some customer service please,0
i used this app with no problems or complaints until the recent upgrade  now it doesnt work at all and i may be finding a new bank,0
it doesnt let me log in at all and i cant transfer funds immediately  even if its between my own accounts  not even on the weekends  i hate to admit it but bank of americas app is way better,0
every time i go to the alerts history portion of the app it crashes and shuts down very frustrating since i cannot read the alerts i have an iphone ,0
you shouldnt have to turn your wifi off just to check your money needs to be fixed,0
wow you would think large companies would pay attention to such minor issues as app not working at all ever since ios  update and even with latest patch i cant even login i have iphone gs,0
i wont even give it  stars until i can use it again ever since ios i cant log into my account it times out every time make it compatible so i can check my balances do it fast,0
ive been trying to log on for two months whats up with this thing it was pretty good but now its completely unusable the customer service people dont even know whats going on,0
cant log in uninstalled because wouldnt go past loading page now it goes past loading page only to tell me that the password is wrong which i know it isnt,0
i can never get access to my account when i need it most whats the point of downloading something thats not going to work but once a blue moon im very disappointed with this download,0
we used to use this app all the time to deposit checks it was awesome not having to go to the bank it hasnt worked for months now fix it,0
i normally love this app its very handy and easy to use however in the last couple of weeks it just will not load on my husbands phone or mine its extremely frustrating,0
it can never connect ive managed to use it a few times but usually cannot log in it times out over and over it is great when it works but that is rare,0
this was great but then the logging issues are such of headache and waste of time this app would be good if you could actually log in and use it very frustrated with this app someone please smack the nerd who messed up the app,0
got my hopes up when i saw there was an updated version today  subject line says it all  come on chase stop blaming apple and fix your app  patiently waiting for app to support wifi again  decent app on cellular network,0
this app suckkkkksssssi thought it would get better after the update but nothing changed i cant  even sign on let alone check my accounts send money or transfer done done done,0
this is crazy you should be able to use this app without it keep kicking you out please fix this asap you have the money due to the additional fees you have created this year,0
now that ive updated it doesnt work at all i cant even log on the one time i did it didnt look the same i didnt like it as much it was great before the messed with a good thing,1
really in this day amp age since the update app only times out and doesnt allow you access not cool time to find another bank with my  checking  credit amp  savings accounts you loose chase,1
the app only works about  of the time  and never when you need it it used to work fine and i dont know why they decided to break it maybe the tellers were getting lonely,0
whatever team is responsible for this app should be fired there must have been no qa testing done the keyboard stays up whenever trying to do a quickpay or money transfer stopping me from moving forward with transaction,0
cant log on deleted app and reinstalled several times requested countless identification codes chase is nonresponsive to inquiries ready to close my longstanding account over this  come on chase fix this already,0
this app is full of bugs and constantly gets stuck the deposit option only worked once very frustrating my other banks app peoples united works perfectly,1
barring some major security flaw there is no reason we should be forced to update this app it is just like a bank to force something like this on youand they wonder why bankscc companies are so hated,0
i hate having to update the app when all i want to do is take a quick look at my account it is easier to just use my computer,0
i dont understand why a bank like chase cant get their app to work always have issues with this application they should take a lesson from associated bank their app hardly ever has any issues,0
why does it seem like every time i want to deposit a check the app always closes and of course theres no chase bank where i am to go to not happy at all with this app they need to fix it asap,0
app wont allow me to long in saying my user id or password is incorrect but ive not changed my passworduser id update fail,0
why cant i use the check deposit it dont work,0
works well use the app all the time just perfect,0
actually took the time out to write this because you people neglect to fix the bugs this app is has been rendered useless if i cant transfer money fix it or im going to light myself on fire,1
after the update the camera doesnt focus correctly and checks come out too blurry to deposit please fix,1
this version stinks  cannot access at all  customer service tells you to just keep trying  well guess what  one week later and still the same  very poor,0
you cant set up re accruing monthly payments,1
havent been able to log in for at least a week i only switched to chase for their tech support i dont like going to the bank get it fixed or i get a new bank,1
i can log in but every time i try to deposit a check it shuts down works ok for iphone  but not s,1
app crashed every time i try the picture deposit feature tried it six times then have up and am considering changing banks to one that works,1
app is mediocre at best the bank behind it is downright bad they put long holds on fully paid off cards for no apparent reason do not get an account with them they dont give a crap about their customers,1
every single time i use this it crashes every single time whoever developed this has no idea what they are doing as this has been a bug for more then a year lol sad,1
answer i dont know yet because there is no sign of stopping seriously maintenance every sunday maybe just start over,1
when i try to make a deposit the app crashes as im about to take a picture of the check please fix,1
everything is clear and functional a welcome update,1
the chase app was getting dated this update changes everythingi want to sincerely congratulate and thank the designers and developers behind this youve created something greatim a young developer myself and your work is inspiringalex,1
i dont know what the reason is that chase doesnt allow external transfer through its own app  other banks app can,1
seems to work very smooth so far thanks,1

only doing this so it can freaking stop asking me to rate when i just want to put my finger print smh,1
easy to use and great design,1
its horrible  very frustrating this bank thinks that one has time for their updates they treat their clients as its a privilege to do business with them really their password issue is unbelievable,1
the app is asking me for an update when i go to the app store there is no update for the app makes no sense,1
i have used the app for years without any problems now it seems like twice a month it shuts off my touch id and makes me reset my password,1
the new update is all messed up the check deposit cam option is not working at all,1
ditto with others who mentioned concerns about being able to clear alertsdoesnt allow touch id for iphone s,0
balance deposit work well,1
very convenient app that covers pretty well all i need to do with a banking app,1
chase does not support joint accounts or even readonly access for authorized users making it impossible to manage household finances through app,1

this is now a five star app  thanks chase for the great update,0
the app keeps telling me that it cant display the info on my student loan on my mobile device ive never had a student loan in my lifeand i cant access my account what the crap,0
very very simple responsive and easy to use does what its supposed to do,0
much better than the bank of america app,1
i would love to use it but if you set up your account online and clicked use card number for log in it wont work for you on this app until they fix that this is garbage,1
yeah they hold my moneys for me and then i can access said moneys on my iphone for random purposes good stuff,0
take  pictures of a check confirm and presto  its deposited,0
despite downloading the current version quick deposit doesnt appear on my iphone  called tech support twice and just got left on hold forever,0
i like the app never tried the quick deposit i upgraded it but still no blueprint,1
great app other than the check deposit not working on ipod th gen please fix soon,0
there is something wrong with the log in button pl fix it fast how could this be overlook i could only wonder,0
overall this app works like a charm though the new layout with last update looks cheap  if its not broken dont fix it,0
i thought my phone was acting up due to the fact that the log in button doesnt work  and what happened to the layout it looks horrible now,0
always gives me errors even though pictures are clear i always have to use a droid to deposit my checks ios app is crap,1
i like the app but i would like the ability to stay logged in and set a passcode to access the app like the usaa app,1
ui could be enhanced,0
the whole reason i switched to chase and i keep getting an unknown error when i try to check deposit  frustrated,0
dont plan on this app balancing your check book although it promises this your transaction post right away but it takes chase three to two day to do the math,1
constantly locks me out cant take pictures of checks well low quality poor user interface tired of calling customer service,1
the app is awesome works great on any iphone i had love it just needs more futures,1
after latest update cant even log in please fix i have multiple alerts,1
loved this app until the latest update now mine wont even open the minute i click it it force closes tried reinstalling it and it does the same thing please fix fast,1
previous version was fine,1
like others i used to deposit my checks all the time via this app now it errors out and tells me to go to the bank once i hit submit please fix this update asap,0
very convienant for on the go  especially for a college student like myself,0
simple and easy no problems with it,1
everytime i log on and try to look at account info it boots me out  very frustrating when it used to work perfectly and was probably my most used app  please fix,0
i used the old one for a while now and it worked great this new update causes the app to crash every time i try to open it please bring back the old version,0
works just like its supposed to a must have for any chase customer,0
cant say enough about this app,0
i find this app really useful,1
easily one of the best apps out there,0
still not updated to fit the iphone  screen,0
very easy to use and gets the job done,0
i used to love my app but i did the mistake and updated it last week now its horrible if they can not get it fixed i will look elsewhere i do too much banking on my phone,0
when are we going to be able to delete unwanted updates such as this from our update screen,0
iphone  support anyone its been out for a while now and its not that hard to update it,0
chase you really didnt update anything still very slow and useless on ios need serious update soon or will delete,0
depositing a check worked once these are always the same checks theyre also chase checks  now every time i try it i get an error message fix this issue and then its great otherwise useless garbage,0
this application is the slowestbuggiest on my phone and is ultimately useless you will find yourself driving to the bank just to avoid even attempting to log into this terrible app steer clear big tuna head for open waters,1
new update this app still does not work properly still times me out still spends too long loading then does not open to my accountplease fix it,1
upgrade forces closed and the graphics now look kinda old school what happened chase,0
whats wrong with you chase  sick of having to update every time i go to the app do you not understand people use this for convenience and continually having to update is not convenient  the utter stupidity of some companies baffles me,0
after the last update the app keeps giving me an error message when i try to log in ,0
i loved this app but recently it wont let me log in it keeps saying it cant connect to chase please fix this so i can access my account,1
same as everyone else just downloaded the app wont log in at all just waits forever and then says cant log in at this time pointless huge company to have such a terrible app,0
i have several other card apps  i had one goal in downloading the app make a payment on top of my automatic payment without using a computer  very confusing  fail,0
used to work great and now its useless keeps loading but never logs on use a few of the billions of dollars you make in profit to deliver the service you promise it should not take weeks to fix this,0
i turned off all of my alerts but they keep coming,0
i have had the app for about  months now and i try regularly to log in with ml success i chose chase partially for their convenient online check depositing and am left disappointed,0
best bank app i have used so far well done,0
shouldnt these be case sensitive love it otherwise,0
wont save user id anymore ive tried turning that feature off and on ive tried uninstalling and reinstalling but nogo this is a huge annoyance since i log on about  times a day at minimum,1
this app isnt iphone friendly due to the issue with the keyboard that chase has no intentions on fixing whats the use of having a bank that doesnt have a working app delete,1
one of the most important features the pay credit cardno longer works it crashes every time,1
my experience with this app has been really satisfying so far no glitches seamless performance and meets all my banking needs good work guys,1
works to look at my accounts but with last update i have no functionality  can not pay bills or make transfers  very frustrating,1
im about to take my accts from chasebank and go somewhere else my chase mobil app has been upgraded without warning and now my app is useless cannot seem to upgrade my iphone  to ios for whatever reason,1
after the update the app isnt working anymore gave  stars for old version but this deserves zero stars hope chase would come out with a working version soon,1
unfortunately this app will not work if you have a chase payroll account for direct deposit ucard site is the only way to view account information,1
this app really need to be tested before new versions are released this is the worst release i have seen to date issues with the calendar and the number pad all over the place,1
this app always worked great for me but after i updated today it crashes every time i try to take the pic of the back side of my check for deposits please fix asap,1
sometimes it accepts my check scan deposits other times it just doesnt offer the submit option very frustrating,1
i really dont like the new look of the app but i do think it looks kind of cool,1
late but the wait was worth it,1
new update is amazing beautiful look and feel,1
great app the update is wonderful me and my brother were happy with are new update thanks,1

not sure why web developers think pretty is necessary for function but here it is,1
love the new look and features of the app on my iphone s,1
it makes life so much easier,0
it is nice useful app but if you compere it with the european one it is still like prehistory i use csob app for my czech account and there is a huge bias between them,1
user interface is great intuitive and easy to use,1
big improvement,1
cool and convenient app really frustrating when trying to deposit a money order urghh,1
i love this app i do most of my banking on the phone now good job chase,1
this app works well and makes deposits really easy,1
i kind of got used to the app before but this one is so much better it wen greets me when i sign in its awesome,1
as a designer i really like the look it was a great surprise after the update,1
this app rocks its so nice to know my bank is always right at my fingertipsgreat job,1
now we just need ipad support,1
i hate this new chase app i cannot seem to find anything all of which was easily found before the update i guess if there is a positive the font is bigger,0
very nice improvement it was always good but now its really great,1

this app is awesome the deposit works just do as it says ,0
my other bank lets me deposit up to  with their app but chase limits me to   which pretty much makes this app useless for me,1
app crashes every time i attempt to take a picture of a check for deposit not able to deposit checks thats the best feature fix it,0
great app fix the check deposit feature every time unknown error,0
love the deposit concept but it just doesnt work consistently after lots of attempts on different checks mint and google maps already do the other stuff deleted,0
it worked great for a while now it crashes and always tells me it cant connect to chase when i try to deposit a check through the app,0
after update when i try to log on it wont let me enter the periods in my user name i use the mobile app more than logging on to the website on the computer bad chase bad bad bad ugh,0
needs to have the alerts problem fixed i thought i was doing something wrong until i read the latest reviews,0
good mobile access especially the available balance however the push alerts arent clearing and its very annoying,0
had no problems with the app till alerts wouldnt clear extremely annoying fix them,0
wish i had read some of the other reviews before updating recently it now crashes upon launch every time utterly useless and frustrating,0
i downloaded it mainly so i can deposit checks with my phone and the one thing its not letting me do is deposit checks from my phone,0
highly recommend it,0
i uses to be able to pay bills from the app now it wont let me move past the edit payee page please fix,1
chase screws all customers out of quick deposit that have had a  balance in their account at any point in time,0
my iphone is g i liked this chase mobile app a lothowever once i deleted couple days ago and try to reinstall iti found the new version of chase mobile app did not support ios this is a big problem for me because i would like to continue using it on my iphone gif you know how to fix this problem please let us knowthanks,0
i really thought this app was useful until my current ios  update after the update i havent been able to view any account activity very frustrating,0
i used to love this app but since the update i cant see my account activity make transfers and it keeps crashing huge incovience please fix this thanks,0
why would an update make the ap worse cant upload account activity also cannot make  alerts go away it wont let me open alerts either booooooo,0
have this app for quite some time and have been awesome the whole time until recently cant sign in most of the time pls fix,0
literally never works at all i always have to sign on with a desktop its annoying never not once have i ever had a problem with bank of america looks like ill be taking my money to my old reliable bank with a working app,0
used to be great reliable and convenient now i cant even log in and havent been able to for at least the past three weeks this makes it wildly inconvenient someone please fix it,1
okay even after update it is still not working can you plz get it together already come on its been like this for over a month bs,0
the app doesnt even work can never even move past the login screen its been at least a few months now and still no fix,1
i like that i can download the app but i cant really log on itit say timed out alotneed to fix that or make a upgrade too the app,0
worst app ever downloaded waste of time doesnt even work wouldnt be surprised if your accounts where getting hacked theres no security here people can bypass the identification screen be aware people,0
i used to love the app until the iphone upgrade and now it no longer works for me either i too tried to redownload to no avail i hope a fix is found soon,0
sick of chase updates every other freakin month or under construction  i live in nyc we are always up here i rely heavily upon this app and its always some crap with it it was running fine leave it alone,0
why did they feel it was necessary to update it to not allow the first few generation devices to run the app at least have an alternative app available,1
this app used to work great now when i log in it never goes through and it crashes a lot needs to be fixed,1
this app is fairly pointless and useless if im unable to loginwhat makes it worse is that im writing this review after the supposed update to fix that problem,0
dont like the new update at all the transaction screen that lists all ur transactions is too big i liked the old version way more  go back to old version please,0
this is a great app keeps me updated with my account,0
i cannot make payments freezes or crashes every time i used to be able to not sure whats going on pease fix,0
good app it needs a new innovative feature,0
i can no longer log in tried reinstalling twice and have requested  identification codes and still cannot log in it may work for some people but why take a chance,1
cant get into the app  tells me its trying to fix something and to try again later  been like this for a week now  extremely inconvenient  please fix,0
whats the point of having a save user id option if it doesnt workplease fix,1
since i have an older itouch i guess i am not worthy of working software since the new update will not work on my device so the software is now disabled  thanks for nothing chase,0
ive been using this app for about a year and i love it,0
never any issues very convenient,0
i loved the app but now it wont let me deposit a check it keeps saying it isnt clear even though it is perfectly clear,1
wish the long lag for loading the login screen would be fixed not mention how long it takes to sign in,0
latest update again causes iphone deposits to consistently fail reporting image not clear enough off to waste my time standing in the bank branch tomorrow,1
this app is very limited on your account access if your going to provide an app make it like your website duh what year is this i am pretty sure the technology is there by now,1
so there is a daily quick deposit limit what the  i thought this was a feature to make my life easier now i have to go to the bank gt useless nice work chase,1
this app has always worked great for me,1
when i log in then try to pay bills or transfer money to another acct it wont let me do anything and i have ios  so u need to update to fix that problem,1

my application was working fine until today when i updated i cant even get to the login page anymore it just crashesiphone s tmobile,1
it worked before the update now its just a blue screen until i hit the home button this is an iphone s with the the firmware installed,1
layout is terrible compared to the old version new version doesnt even load click to open it just crashes cant even use it so its a waste,0
ever since the update now it just loads a blue screen and crashes seconds later used to love the app now i have to check on my browser all the time fix it please,0
good for basic mobile banking but only if using the iphone  not currently updated for os and using on the ipad is hard on the eyes due to distortion,0
as it doesnt provide access to transactions,0
the app keeps getting better touch id login soon i hope,0
the only useful feature of this app has ceased to work ever time i take a picture of the check the screen goes blank and the app crashes,1
this updates breaks deposits for anyone using iphone s unable to select photo after taking picture cant deposits my checks pls fix asap,0
after update i can no longer deposit checks hopefully there will be an update to correct soon,1
like several others my quick deposit picture wont work with my s no troubles before update,1
love the app but needs to be able to login with thumb print for s and higher,0
user friendly and efficient,1
never had a problem before but suddenly i cant hit the use or the retake buttons in the check deposits sectionsadness,0
i hate this app and i want to switch banks and the app adds reason to switch this app always freezes and never refreshes i have to restart my phone just so the app will work again,0
cant deposit because use button doesnt work after entering amount for deposit doesnt advance to next screen was there no qa for this release terrible,0
if you have an iphone s quick deposit does not work in this version it was known prior to this update and still not addressed inexcusable,0
when will this app support the iphone  resolution also when will this app support touch id my other banking apps already support iphone  resolution and touch id,1
it is not compatible with the  amp  plus it still looks stretched out and ugly,0
the mobile deposit feature barely ever works very frustrating  awful compared to wells fargos mobile deposit feature,0

good app negative reviews are from people who dont know how to use the app to its full potential,1
the update keeps telling me that i need to update but i have to have ios  or later my iphone + will not update to that so it will not work anymore,1
how can an app not be able to work on a mobile device,1
 desperately needs touch id  cant view secure messages  have to go to each account to read alerts should have a unified inbox for all alerts,1
secure message center used to work but now just gives me a blank screen nothing after  minutes,1

ok but not as user friendly as other credit card apps,1
the only thing its missing is a way to view statementstransactions mobily,1
this is a very efficient banking app,1
the alerts function is a shambles otherwise a decent practical app,0
the only credit card information this app shows is current balance  i can never figure out how much i owe each month  terrible and deceitful,0

replaces the branch and any online service app is top notch,1
very easy to use makes banking a breeze,1
message center says i have  messages but when i try to see them i get an empty screenlower your expectations and then it seems acceptable,1
logged in and yet have to put password to pay makes touch id useless and everything harder the positive reviews must have been encouraged shall we say,1

why wouldnt any financial app in this day not have the ability to login with touchid seems to me its much more secure than a password,0
i really liked it untilit no longer exists on my phone i cant download the app because i have an iphone  and i cant even login on the website annoyed,1
the app is ok compared to capital one its behind the time also  they need to take their paper size to x when printing statements,1
this app is cool but for some reason mostly every time i try to log in it says that theyre temporarily unavailable and to try again later if they fix that itd be awesome,1
bs free apps are special this is one of them,1
great features never a bug easy banking,1
very convenient and always works on my phone,1
my fingerprint is sufficient to log into the app yet i have to enter my password to make a statement payment dumb,1

i use password and the new version does not allow me to paste my  character password the previous version did,0
 is so much better  stars,0
a very quick and clean interface love it,1
highly recommended,0
i recommend this app to anybody who banks with chase great app,0
for a week now i can not view account actvityeven replaced the app and still have the same problem,0
i really love this app it helps me keep track of my finances on the go,1
for transfers sometimes they dont go through app says they do nut then they dont show up the next day good for checking balance,0
amazingthe check deposit is fantastic,1
but it works great i wouldve put up five stars but i had to take off of two for dishonesty dont be greedy shakin my head,0
the check deposit is tricky but very cool,0
i got the new ipod with the camera and i cant deposit my checks like they did in the commercial update it please,0
well it seems chase has decided not to honor their promises to those of us who had free wamu accounts personally im moving my accounts to an institution that i can trust chase has no credibility i dont want my money held by bank i cant trust,0
also tapping login seems laggy and unresponsive vs previous version,1
this use to work now i input checks and they disappear it also wont let you view your register in check number order terrible,0
i am getting peoples alerts history that dont pertain to me i wake up after the update and have new alerts dailyhave to clear it out plz fix your alerts an security,1
this app used to be amazing but for the past few weeks i have not been able to view my transaction histories i keep getting an error saying i cant be connected please fix,0
loved the check depositing ability,1
doesnt take a picture of the check even when i do hold my phone steadily,1
chase is the best bank recommend this app,0
how about an update  pictures no matter how clear are never accepted quicker to drive down and make the deposit in person,1
there is no quick deposit button ive uninstalled an downloaded twice and still nothing,1
could you do as all my other peers and wait until you have everything worked out before launching new updates,0
theres something seriously wrong with the functionality of this app money transfers from savings to checking are resulting in double transfers or money appearing to not have been transferred etc,1
i am really impressed with this application,1
it doesnt let me input the  symbol for my email to try n log on the notifications wont clear even after deleting the app how am i supposed to use it if it doesnt even let me log in,1
was better before alerts dont clear other than that i love it,1
went from being one of my favorite apps to total garbage doesnt even let you log on any more dont waste your time until the bugs are fixed,1
love chase from beginning to end best app innovation in the world  love banking with you,1
its a great app when it works it keeps locking me out i have to keep calling and going into the branch to reset password not good,0
when transferring money from my savings to my checking the keyboard will not go away once you click done,1
this app does what it should and the graphics are great,0
its really perfect i can whatever whenever  use it  i like it thx chase,0
alerts dont work i have none set to on yet it constantly pushes alerts very annoying so i am going to uninstall this,0
really like this app very convenient except that auto spell correction doesnt work on it,0
crash all the time,0
have no complaints about this app,0
ive been using this app for awhile and i have to say i love it,0
i love this app great interface and very user friendly,0
needs an update to take advantage of the larger screen size of the iphone ,0
i havent been able to log in for weeks you would think a company like chase would fix their app a lot faster than this,1
allows me to stay on top of my account,1
will not allow me to log on to app through wifi when on lte it works fine whats the deal,0
after i updated to what was supposed to be a fix for the ios  comparability issuesit still doesnt work i have given up on the app,1
the update required os not for the older version that means if i cant upgrade my version i need to buy a new phone really never seen any stupid idea for banking service like chase ill trasnfer the banking for sure,1
every time i try to take a photo for checks it crashes it worked before but not anymore,0
is a waste of time wont let me log on anymore locky i also have bank of america chase support have to update this app to fix this problem needs to be done,0
need to fix the app update not working with ios  either it may not be the app it could be the ios but chase has to find the compatible coding for apple mess app works fine on the older ios,0
gives timeout every time for a month nowsaves password when i turn it off how can you give me alerts when i am not saving my password,0
 of the time this app doesnt work due to loading issues when it works its a great app whats the purpose of having it when the app doesnt work more than it actually works,0
can no longer log in it just times out after after trying for a few seconds will not allow log in over wifi but will via g ufb,0
i have an iphones  the app is working well for me,0
the only reason i didnt leave is because i have the freedom card and it would be awesome if you added a feature to activate rewards programs directly from the app like you can on the discover card app,1
very poor app for a financial institution dont expect to actually log on when you need to works maybe  of the time would give  stars if i could,0
please add a quick login  a quick login gets you  stars thanks,0
iphone gs ios this app works perfectly for me in every way,0
i have to have wifi turned off in order to connect now and even then it doesnt connect  of the time use to be a good app very disappointed,0
great app when you can login have had to reinstall a  of times but sometimes still doesnt login extremely frustrating,1
terrible because of limits to the amount one can deposit daily and monthly into an account  please remove check deposit limits,0
cant deposit checks sometimes and you guys always do maintenance every sunday is it really necessary to do it every sunday why cant you just fix it the first time,0
this app is useless it wont even perform simple functions like transfer money from one account to the other dont bother with this one  just use the website,0
use to work fine and after the update it wont load it just spins and burns my battery until it tells me it cant connect completely worthless i am deleting it disgusted,0
highly unreliable and annoying especially w check deposits dont offer a service that works less than  of the time i know chase is not known for caring too much abt customers but this app is too substandard to not report,1
dont understand how this doesnt get awesome reviews this app is amazing,1
after the latest update i can no longer see my balance and credit card limit,1
app will continually crash after you take a picture of a check  must go to branch and deposit checks ,1
last update made mobile pay bills no longer able to be used  keep getting errors,0
on my new iphone s i cant make deposits the app crashes as soon as i click the camera button to take a photo of the check being deposited,1
i cant pay my bills online its good for checking your balance but thats really it,1
multiple crashes trying to take pics of check deposit useless,1
the second you hit the camera button to deposit a check the app crashes,1
seems chases mobile site is down bummer would have been convenient to be able to access over my iphone,1
wont take pictures of the check  after the shutter is pressed the screen just shows hold steady and never takes a photo,1
very pleased with the update ,1

love the new look took,0
the ui on this app is beautiful and the usability is clean and straightforward,0
i like that its just at my finger tips using this app for my accts,0
amazing app gets all my financials done fast and safe,0
the new version shows transactions but not the account balance after the transaction how is that supposed to help in any way,0
chase is the best banking app can you please add touch id support to log in,0
if the intent was to discourage people from making deposits with app by breaking the check photo functionality then the new app was a great success,1
crashes everytime i take picture for back of check,0
this version is supposed to have better compatibility with iphone  but the app is still stretched why even bother,0
depositing checks on this app is supposed to be a convenience but if i went to the bank to deposit my check i wouldnt have had to wait  days,0
solid app with a great ui all thats missing is touch id,1
it was all fine and dandy until the stupid update showed up and now i cant deposit checks fix it will you,1

after taking pictures of checks the use and retake buttons dont work im unable to deposit checks iphone s running ios,0
i went with chase cuz i thought it was cutting edgeapp works for everything but what i need check deposit it was wonderful until they give us their wonderful latest update hope td bank can do better,1
this used to be a good app now the use and retake buttons for capturing check pictures for deposits are broken i dont know why chase cant fix the problems,1
cant deposit a check on iphone  ios  when i try to press the use button nothing happens really need this to be fixed,1
great use of no real need to go to a branch for payments or transfers,1
everytime you go to use it you have to stop and upgrade it which means the current version is so crappy or so insecure you should not have used it in the first place,0
it is not fair that the updated app is no longer compatible with the systems available for older versions of the itouch i was banking on my itouch last week and now i am unable to,1
please update the app to work with the new phones + such an unpleasant experience when up scaling an old app,1
this app has always worked perfect for me i love it,1
very disappointed with the new version a lot of buildup on this from chase falls flat,1
worked great up until friday and havent been able to get back on called apple and chase and they cant figure out whats wrong,1

easy layout got finger print sign in,1
works great is quick very simple to use,1
easy to use and reliable glad to see i can now use the touch id good idea,1
the app does not give you a total of all pending and accepted transaction thus meaning that you have to go from app to app to know how much money youve spent,1

this app just keeps getting better and better,1

after last update it let me log in all of twice and then back to timing out every time i try to log in annoying its been months please fix the bugs,0
this app is not working on wifii have to turn wifi off for me to login inconvenient this has been the case for  months now and still no fixterrible,0
why would they cut off us poorly g users thought it worked just fine before a few months ago such a pain to log in through safari,0
im on christmas vacation would be freaking great if i could check my account so i can stay on budget all it says is loading,0
you have to disable wifi and use gg to get this app to work now otherwise it will just keep saying you are being securely logged in thanks for your patience not good at all,0
every time i try to log in it says loading for about  minutes then says request timed out used to work fine needs an update,0
i dont understand how this still has not been fixed i have to go to the actual bank  highly inconvenient come on chase get it together,1
this is probably the th time ive had to delete and download the app because it keeps crashing hopefully an update comes soon,0
works great well done,0
the update message is ridiculous what the hell happened to you chase,0
i loved this ap for depositing checks from my phone but after i did the update it licks up in the check deposit feature please fix it,1
worked great until  months ago cant log in using the app or safari or any other browser on my iphone s no issues using my st gen ipad super weird and super frustrating,0
this used to work not always temporarily unavailable  this app was one of the only reasons i kept my account  guess ill transfer my funds to a local bank closer to my house,0
way too slow to load and have to view messages on the computer still,0
i cant make a transfer it gets stuck on the number pad after putting the amount to transfer you cant submit it please fix asap,0
if i cant make transfers and have to get online to do itthere is no point for this app fix this bug,0
it says chase liquid card owners are able to refill their card from the app with a check but they cant,0
please update so each debit card purchase that includes a cash back portion has that cash back portion displayed memos also please,1
ive been unable to log in for days maybe more this app is awesome when it works but having it down for several days in a row is unacceptable,1
crash every single time when i try to deposit a check the is the only function i use the app for it is just useless to me,1
compared to the latest banking and finance apps this is behind the competition some ability to analyze spending is a basic that is missing for example disappointing,1
very well made and useful,0
after the last update shows available balance  for all accounts,0
keeps crashing when trying to make a deposit,0
this app was awesome before i updated my iphone software now it just tells me it cant process my request at this time rrreeeaallllyyyy need a fix soon,1
the app crashes while taking pictures of checks for deposit,0
love the idea of cashing a check by photo but it fails more than it succeeds always says the image is too blurry,0
every time i try to take a picture of a check to deposit it the app crashes fix it,0
great mobile banking ap never fails,1
smooth ux much better experience,1
this app version is beyond compare,1
this update is so clean,1
who designed this new update and why would they get rid of the back feature theres multiple pages that wont let you go back lame very lame,1
when attempting to make a deposit the app says it will take a picture when the camera is steady it never does the old version never had this trouble,1
crashes after taking pic of front of check i closed all apps running in the background still crashes,1
running balance is appearing with credit and debits,1
dont update if you can avoid it the new version has lost functionality and the ui is harder to follow i hope chase improves this junky app,1
it takes forever to sign in if i do sign in at all because  of the time it freezes i have to erase and delete the app and then redownload it booif it aint broke dont try to fix it,1
not sure why they took away viewing charges specific to your last statement which makes reconciling difficult,1

as others have mentioned we are impatiently awaiting an update that includes touchid integration as well as proper scalingoptimization for the iphone  and iphone  plus,0
my banker bragged about how you could deposit a check by just taking photos of ittried to take a photo of a check the app crashes instantly fix it chase,1
latest update says better support for iphone  and iphone  plus yet it still is not optimized for iphone  and  plus resolutions,0
after last update cannot take a picture of check to deposit it,1
when i take the picture and it shows the image the use button doesnt work,0
i use this all the time for deposits and checking balance i give it one star because it freezes all the time i only keep it out of necessity,1
i would give it negative if i could like everyone said after the update the deposit feature doesnt work,0
this used to be a good app now i cannot make deposits also cannot access app support so only option to hopefully get this fixed is to write a bad review,0
the latest update broke the app the use and retake buttons when taking pics of a check to deposit dont work,0
mobile check depositing broke with the last update cant hit use on the photo on iphone s no way to report the problem otherwise great historically,1

use to work now it doesnt hopefully this review as well as other negative reviews will get them to fix the issue in a timely fashion,0

i still have the iphone  and im not able to get on chase at all this app sticks like it much better before the update i was still able to use it get it together chase,1

works very good could be better with the touch id,1
is a great app but ill be better if you can add the touch id ,1

this app is easy to navigate and very convienant live chase bank ,0

makes my life easier,1
simple sleek and easy to navigate,1
i like the ease of use,1
app is horrible is it so difficult to implement the normal logics of password storing every time i enter the password in the app  it is saying that it is incorrect,1
i really liked the app till about a week ago what happened to touch id bring it back and it will be as great as this country is about to be,1
sick of all the updates it forces you to update the app every week it seems this is so annoying,0
pretty useless keeps saying it cannot use the image even though the check image is fine  i just deleted the app  another chase failure,1
i can only check the balance on my account no other features work including quickpay and check deposits,1
new problem on current update where i cant dial touch to dial the phone numbers on app,1
good capabilities lot of area to improve on but works whats in there and good performance as well,1

easy to use great financial institution for all my needs,1
ads and offers clutter the app and theres no way to opt out of them does everything have to be polluted with inyourface marketing its almost as bad as the shills that write  star reviews for chase,1
if only it had ultimate rewards built in itd be perfect love it otherwise,0
this is a great app i have never had an issue,1
on an iphone  application keeps giving a message of too many login attempts without not even try to login once and keep canceling the finger print login process,0
check deposit is the best,1
convenient and easy to use,1
a bit clunky and nonintuitive but it gets the job done except when it does not,1
love it makes my life easier,1
this could be a great app but it constantly requires you to reset your password very frustrating amp impossible to use while traveling,1
most of the checks we receive we cant mobile deposit because the image isnt clear trust me it is,1
great app for phones and my iphone but horrible on my ipad looks like a blurred blown up version of a mobile app,1
does everything i need,1
this is my least favorite banking app  it never remembers my device  i have to log in multiple times in order obtain my balance,1

great app love it very convenient and simple i use it all the time,1
great app and very easy to use,1
good app but consistent error messages when it come to mobile check deposit,1
my visa is the only account i have with chase this app works great for managing it,1
hard to change a password doesnt retain remembering my device shuts off fingerprint id often,1
like the title says you cant set a new password from the app it will throw an invalid password at you no matter if your credentials follow protocol or not,1
i factory reset and restored my phone yesterday and this app doesnt work i enter the password can catch the glimpse of home screen and then it crashes,1
very easy to understand,1
the quickpay option doesnt work it was the only reason i downloaded the app it used to work great but its useless since they got with zelle,1
cant open the app since the latest update i have even uninstalled and reinstalled and still no luck getting it to open,1
this app makes banking on the go so easy and convenient,1
easy to use eliminate unnecessary trips to the bank,1
this app is awesome  works very well  i use daily,1
this app meets my needs and i rely on it daily,1
great app makes my life easier,1

easy to use what elce can i say its very reliable love it ,1
app is great but always says temporarily unavailable for me could be something on my end too though,0
what an awesome app lets me make payments and stay up to date,0
this app is excellent and works with ease,1
now with touch sign in this app is perfect,1
my app only works on wifi and thats about half the time when it works i really do like the easiness of using it just wish they would get it together _,0
love this app so easy to use,0
all the convenience of pc access,1
i had to load the app  times before it worked then with st use it failed and told me to try again later frustrating,1
this app never works for me it always says that its currently unavailable when it does allow me to log me it works great but never lets me log in,1
the app is similar to their mobile app needs work in displaying transactions once you have logged in great job chase for now,1
should be downloaded by most customers,1
dont waste your time with this one annoying activation process everytime i logged in all it does is take you to the chase mobile website,0
nothing but the mobile web link amp you cant see last statement transactions  is there a way to get to the real site from the iphone is this what chase did with the b,1
just great im using it every day could not ask for anything alse,0
very convenient i commend chase for moving with the time,0
this app is very rudimentery guys take a look at wamus app and learn it is not frendly and poor in options and it collapse personal acc and bussiness acc big mistake question jpmorgan are your firm related to the pirate the thief,0
now i can see my business accounts just cant transfer anything useless at this point,1
this is a must have for chase customers,1
crashes after update cant login please fix,1
save my time,0
that new deposit feature made this app so much more useful never have to go to the bank now yeah,0
works great easy to use and navigate,0
the decision to move from a clean easily readable format to this unclear confusing jumble of information was not prudent had i known i would absolutely not have updated total fail,0
works great no issues,1
i have had this app for awhile now but all of a sudden i cant deposit my checks and it used to work what happened,0
good app overall except i cant see my credit card statements which makes it nearly useless for my purposes add this function and it would be  stars,1
 reinstalls and its still freezing on the login screen worked perfect just a week ago,0
great app but for some reason i keep getting alerts for other peoples accts,1
i love this app dont understand why people are giving it bad reviews,0
love the app but my notifications wont clear now sooooo annoying ,0
new version has a glitch the notification doesnt clear after you check it which is very annoying,0
what is going on with this app i havent had any issues until today with this red alert i hate seeing these red icons fix this app i had to delete it just to get rid of this alerts,0
the quick deposit feature is pathetic you have to have a professional camera to get an adequate picture for them,1
dont even dare going to an area where the keyboard pops up ie paying bills the previous version a few month ago didnt have that problemplease fix,1
im having problem transfer money on this app plz fix this bug,0
the app was awesome until i downloaded the update i try to log on and it never loads it stays on the home screen i have deleted and installed the app twice and still nothing,0
every day it gives me more nonexistent notifications today i had  its ridiculous,0
i was a fan of this app but lately it keeps saying the password is invalid even though ive entered it correctly so at this point its unusable for me,1
never been let down,1
every time i go to pay a bill the number pad wont go away so i can never submit it,0
chase probably figured out this app helped people avoid overdraw fees chase doesnt give a rip about its customers at all  very unpleasant to deal with  i give their whole company  star,0
app crashes literally every time i use it it also happens randomly fix it,1
i used to love this app it was great for everything but now you can barely make it through checking your balance before it crashes,0
very good and handy app for me and all my mates,0
fantastic product,0
app used to work great until the ios  update no longer works please fix it and then i will download it again until then it will remain deleted,0
this app used to work perfectly but it takes so long to load now please fix this,0
useless because it wont load this needs to be fixed asap because i wont use my card if i cannot check my balances on the go,0
i like it a lot its a very good idea developed a very good application,0
i took this app because i needed it and its helping me a lot,0
since ios app hangs a lot at login or after login screen  sometimes only way to fix it is reboot the iphone,0
i already gave up with this app it keep on timing out on me im glad i got another bank apps that really works and i am thinking of closing my account with chase totally because of this inconvenience,0
doesnt work while on wifi comcast gateway router update has not resolved issue please resolve issue,1
constant updates lately and now the app doesnt even work when you have something that works perfectly why mess with it,0
will probably delete soon if connection issues dont get resolved  this app was great  one of the main reasons ive stuck with chase as my bank,0
this app has stopped working completely after the apple update  ive tried deleting the app and reinstalling with no luck  it is garbage,0
i closed my accounts last thursday because of this app i hadnt been able to sign in for months and finally got sick of it one week fine six months inappropriate,0
from the time i installed the new version of this app i am unable to login  the request keeps timing out  super inconvenient  please get this fixed asap,0
when this app works it works great however in the last two months i havent been able to open this app and it keeps timing out,0
can only pay your chase mortgage with this app if you have a chase bank account if you have any other bank account it wont let you,0
the app is constantly timing out and you can only log in on rare occasions i called chase and was told theres nothing they canwill do about it will someone fix it,0
great app but i dont want to have to turn off my wifi each time i need to access chase,0
have not been able to log in for a week now very frustratingfroze my phone a few times as well,1
i used to love this app but after the update i am not able to sign in anymore smh,0
it used to work great but now it wont let me make a payment  what use is an app like this that doesnt allow this particular function,1
this app does not work very well you can set up your alert settings but every time you log in too see them it kicks you off the app and logs you off what a waste,0
doesnt work worth a flip since the last update grrrrrr kind of pointless of having this account when the main selling point was the quick deposit and now it doesnt work,0
this app is as worthless as their loan department  being a realtor i have first hand knowledge  closing my accounts in the morning  i have not been able to do anything on line in weeks,1
the update still did not fix transfer of funds issue the app doesnt crash but now it just gets hung up and does nothing,1
this app used to work great but after the last update it wont login i have deleted the app and downloaded it again but that did not help please fix the app,1
step up to the plate and fix the annoying crashing,0
the previous verions of the app work fine these forced updates are bs because nearly every update breaks something it is extremely irritating please stop forcing your customers to do this,0
after nd update app just simply blacked outnow i cant use mobil chase at all it was only way i wanted to use it by passing computers what now dont make those mandatory it should be optional,0
check deposit is challenge,1
this app should borrow some of the features from the capital one app such as capital ones ability to view and redeem rewards through the app,0
user id does not remain even with the save your user id turned on please fix,0
i havent been able to log on either very frustrating when i called they said it was working fine but its not  please fix it,0
the latest update is frustrating because it wont remember my user id why is this why bother having an option to remember if it wont remember,0
thanks,0
past versions saved user id now that they fixed this i love it,0
fixed my login issue,0
tired on multiple checks different backgrounds different light levels and different versions of the app all fail,0
they force you to upgrade and every upgrade is worse than the last dont be surprised when hackers get into you accounts very insecure app poorly designed as well,0
cannot pay my credit card anymore  ,1
the white looks old and outdated,1
please add review check feature from fraud protection services and ill give you  stars thank youp sim using iphone  with ios  and everything works just perfectusing mobile deposit every week never had problems have my deposit within a day love itim using app every day and dont remember when it crashed last timethis app much better than pnc appthx developers for this app,1
having to update the app every couple of months is such a hassle and i can never notice any changes or differences after each update,1
i tried several times to deposit a check but every time i got a error message and suggested me to deposit it at local branch ,0
need to fix the app update not working with ios  either it may not be the app it could be the ios but chase has to find the compatible coding for apple mess app works fine on the older ios,0
this app force closes all the time and when trying to deposit an online check it takes way too long,1
please fix,1
requires constant updates but once updated everything looks the same no changes ,1
updates should be optional you control freaksif you dont make updates optional we all are going to delete your app and take our business somewhere elsei hope you read thisi am a very unhappy customer,1
do not update the new interface is over designed and not good for the at a glac qualities that originally made this app a huge perk to using chase bank,1
i love the new interface,1
the update is incredible great work,1
finally great ui works perfectly,1
most beautiful app on my phone now,1
the new user interface is less user friendly than the old i also dont have a photo on the login screen only a plain blue background,1

its great to have a mobile app that never lets you log in im glad i never have to check my checking account balance or anythingfix asap,1
this app has never worked for me you would think that one of the largest banks in the world would have a semifunctioning app this app never works i have an iphone s and verizon dont waste your time,0
deposits usually dont work  it even asks you to verify data sometimes then after you do it still rejects deposit so whats the point of verifying,1
transactions activities looks too condensed crashes and dumps you back to the home screen a few minutes in,0
this app is awesome and saves me time and gas very userfriendly,0
havent been able to log in for several days nowsuper frustrating fix the app already,0
does not open hasnt worked for weeks its very irritating as its usually important when i need to check my account balances on my phone please fix asap,0
i hate the fact that when we used their chase freedom credit cards on purchses and we suppose to get  cash backblah wateva when i check my app ultimate rewards and theres no points,0
and i dont mean point of service cant get alerts to turn off everyday i have  notifications they are off in the alert management but still get them disappointed,0
most of the time it wont even let me log in when it does it is nice another drawback is you have to update app before you can use it sometimes,0
the app disappeared from my phone wont open cant redownload from app store shows up in my itunes on my mac but cant get it to show back up on my phoneannoying,0
does everything for me,0
can take pictures fine but fails with submission im trying to deposit a chase escrow refund check irony,0
i think you guys should add time of purchase to the transactions reflected on the mobile app,0
i loved the chase app until it started acting up whats up with this i cant get access to my money it needs to be fixed asap,0
every time i try to log in it says error we are currently working to fix this issue its been several days amp i still cant login fix this,0
i am no longer able to log in to my account after this update always telling me unable to connect me to chase,0
with latest update now i cant log in iphone  says my login info is incorrect although it still works on the website please fix i loved this app before,0
after the update the app deleted itself off my phone but when i go to the app store it shows open as if its already downloaded it wont open from at app store please fix,0
this app hardly ever works whats the point in having the option of depositing your checks or even logging onto the app if it never works,0
accounts balance shows as  when different regional settings are selected fix it as this is so embarrassing to you guys ,1
latest update changed all balances to  and you can no longer pay credit cards via the app please fix asap,1
it keeps crashing when i take a pic of checks to be deposited i no longer rave about this app,1
since update this app doesnt work when is apple or chase going to fix this problem my husbands still works after the update go figure,1
i find it really obnoxious that you require cookies to be enabled for this app to work after the ios update i keep cookies disabled for a reason and will not change that for this app deleted,0
wont work with newest apple update as disgusting the amount of money they gross annually is they should be able to afford some programmers to keep up with simplistic software updates,0
app keeps crashing after taking a photo in deposit please fix and update,0
bug fixes needed this app closes when snapping a check photo for a deposit on a iphone s but works on the ipad  please fix,0
every time i take a picture of a check for a deposit the app closes  this is a recent problem  please fix this chase,0
this app has gone from ok to crap the deposit feature shuts the app off when taking pictures of the cheque completely useless please fix,0
it crashes constantly when trying to take a picture of a check to deposit doesnt inspire confidence,1
it is a great way to do online banking,1
now update the awful ipad app,1
its a good app that you have made i like this new app,1
really nice design great utility would like to see a major update though,1
new look doesnt feel right and app is down all the time after the upgrade they need to fix this connectivity issue asap,1
this new version does not capture real time balances i do not need to see photos of nyc but rather keep track of my money  the old version was great in balancing check booki hate this new version,1
ruined an app that worked perfectly now i have loading and lag time issues plus glitches galore so irritating to use this app now,1
looks good but whenever i try to take a picture of the check it crashes its very frustrating i rather have an app thats reliable and usable over good ui,1
i installed this app because i wanted to deposit checks with my phone via this app this feature does not work,1
struggling with the calendar in the app update i touch it and nothing happens for several seconds whats going on am i the only one makes paying bills almost impossible,1

i like it  because i can manage it good,0
the app its not working on my phone,0
the app keep telling me to download but it wont do it  i delete the whole app and now it wont even let me re download it to my iphone s,0
ever since you guys updated i havent been able to even get to the log in screen iphone s please update this is a app i use daily,0
wont let me schedule payment keeps telling me that i already have a payment scheduled,0

cannot log in to mobile site since updating app i do all my banking online through mobile device ready to switch banks,0
ever since the update it takes a really long time to login most of the time the app just crashes during the login process,0

the november update broke this app it no longer works for depositing checks after you take picture on iphone s you cannot hit button to accept,0
stop requiring me to update the app every single time i actually need to use it for just checking balances the latest version isnt absolutely critical,0
cant even take pictures anymore not very well designed for larger checks or for any cuz it keeps saying the image is not clear its just a piece of crap i wonder whos the moron designer,0
the only thing that makes this app worth having is currently not working get it together chase and apple,1
wow is anyone at chase paying attention to any of theses reviews the check deposit is not working please do us all a favor and fix this with an new updated   its about the only thing i like about this app  when it works,1
how much longer must we wait for an iphone + and touch id support says there hasnt been any talk internally about having this in future updates,1
excellent app even better now with preview very satisfied customer,1
they locked out my quick deposit without reason do not bank here and as soon as i can im switching to a different bank,1
cant believe that an institution like chase with so many technical resources cant get this stuff working by know too much marketinglittle to show,1
great app i use it all the time  good for on the go account updates,1
great app but lacks iphone  plus support and touch id so that you dont have to keep signing in over and over other than that the app is flawless,1
tired of having to update this thing all the time when nothing changes if your gonna waste my time an data make it worth it,1
it is very annoying that almost every time i access the app i have to download a new update before i can actually use it,1
will not run without an update update requires the newest ios which i do not want on my phone so off it goes,1
all together a good enough of an app but still no plus support and no touch id authentication,1
great app  stars when you add the ability to log in via a touch id please add touch id,1
over all i love the app i can easily stay on top of my finances the thing its missing is the touch id come on chase,1
this app is probably the best banking app ever made chase is really awesome,1

am so sick of trying to log on and unable to transfer money or pay bills looks like its time to find another bank,0
i find it mind boggling that a bank with  billion of annual revenue cannot spent a few hundred thousand dollars on making a decent iphone app this app is puts this whole bank to shame,1
i use the app almost daily very interactive and easy great app,0
made me update before i could continue using it worked great before and now i cant even log in why mess with a good thing very frustrating,1
broken since last update does not save id doesnt seem to be a priority for app developer should have been fixed by now,0
user id does not get saved when device is powered off and then back on,0

after i installed the update i havent been able to even sign on this issue is going on almost  wks now  please fix issue i normally use this app to do  of my banking,0

updated the app and it will no longer allow me to log init just freezes on the loading screen please fix,1
cant pay bill from this app  pay button is disabled  cant depend on this app or youre be late paying your billthen they hit you with a late fee,1
this app quits anytime i try to make a deposit or do anything with it i downloaded it for less than  minutes and already deleted it,1
i use it all of the time very convenient ,1
horrible app i trued logging in at least  times i inly got to see my balance once and my activities page would never open what a waste of time,1
its okay but every time i go into the app it tells me to reenter my password please fix,1
my credit union app is better than this chase app it takes long to load the keyboard does not go away and i can never make any transactions its frustrating,1
you have to log in for every stupid alert and then it is some lame alert,1
app crashes every time i try to deposit a check,1

the app needs a lot of improvements to be working as suppose to do so,0
not a fan of advertisement on this app used to be a clean app and pleasant to use without being bombarded with credit card offers,0
most other apps work off a fingerprint  this one does not  everything else is great,1

i hate the pop up crap   cant we just do what we need to without xing out of closing or choosing no to something every  secondsi hate that,1
check deposit never works and i end up with a bunch of signed checks that i now have to carry around until i can get to the bank,0
easy to deposit checks transfer between accounts etc very reliable,0
stupid app always says too many log in attempts even after  attempt and makes me reset password piece of crap now was better,0
this app is the worst out of all of my banking apps every time i go to log in it tells me my account is locked and i have to make a new password i hate it  i wish i could give it no stars,1
constantly getting locked out of my account with a too many log in attempts message after first try,1
it does want i need but i would like to use my finger print to login,1
great app for paying mortgage and seeing details of statements,1

constantly has trouble logging in and gives you about one try before you are locked out,1
easy to use and works well,1

ive always seen my checking account activity perectly looove iiit,1

i preferred the earlier version of thus appyou know the one where the deposits actually worked,0
i saw this app on tv and i cant even use the deposit button cause there isnt one what gives,0
please retinafy the app otherwise awesome new deposit feature works great,1
update so quick deposit works with the ipod touch g,1
the check deposit feature looked useful disapointed that it does not work on the new ipod touch models,0
when you really need the app it goes down for maintenance if you are gonna fix things do it in app updates i am seriously considering trying bofa and see if they have their stuff together,0
i love this app it is working great but please make the online deposit amount bigger lol,0
ive been trying to have the deposit function on my iphone amp it wouldnt work i even tried redownloading the app,0
installed app solely for making deposits for some reason chase doesnt tell you upfront that there is a k max limit per check not online not in video demo not in agreement waste of time,1
one of the best app i used every daykeep it up,0
way better than boa  more functionality and way cleaner,0
good app userfriendlyan option to redeem rewards on the app would be awesome,1
every morning the app says i have  alerts amp it gives me alerts for accts which arent mine otherwise great app,1
come on developers get on this the deposit check feature is the only reason i wanted this app and it gives me an unknown error every single time app is in desperate need of an update,1
good app,0
it gives you g,0
cant log in  how can i get it to stop showing me alerts from someone elses account that borrowed my phone  i deleted the app and cache a few times and nothing changes  help,1
ive had no access to my account transactions for two weeks now each time says cant connect with chase frustrating,0
this app has not been working lately i cant login and it says that it is currently unavailable very time time i try to login or i get a blank blue screen please fix and update,0
worked fine until the new update  wont clear alerts even after you read them,1
wow no regrets about this one im pretty impressed how it actually delivers,1
the app has a red circle with a number in iteven after reviewing my alerts the push notifications wont go awayfix this,1
i cant get rid of my alert badges now plus im still getting alerts for someone elses account which is really annoying please fix,1
totally worth downloading,0
i love this app its so easy to use and works great,1
probably the best app that i have ever downloaded,1
never had any problems until this last upgrade now kicks me out every time i want to see my activity on my account,1

a password reset within the app would be nice,1
since the latest update i havent been able to log on this was a great app please fix it,0
cant get rid of the key pad once you type on the amount so i cant submit the quickpay please fix,1
great app only minor bugs that need fixing,0
ive been recommending it to all my friends,0
it works pretty good on my ipad,0
just what i was looking for,0
it should be better at showing why your current available balance is as it is,0
it is a very nice app and it is very easy to use,0
i love the latest update,0
features are great,0
very good to have i use it very often,0
they update it but dont fix the screen size on ip,0
i am terribly disappointed since the ios  update and last chase update this app worked near flawlessly before both,0
it crash a lot on my new iphone  it needs to update the app to support ios  and iphone ,1
freaking frustrating that this is the only account im not able to check because it keep trimming out on login please fix ios ,0
app hasnt worked in over a month  pulled my money out and closed my account  bank of america has the same app and it works great  opened a new account at boa and am very happy with their app  chase what matters  i did,1
the app continually times out  chase manages to give you plenty of service charges as they have that part of the business model down,0
 now this app is terrible cant get past the initial page after logging in always says there is maintenance or your request cannot be processed at this time,0
prior to the fix it used to work great  now im lucky if i can see my acct balances but i can no longer see the detail or do any transactions what did you do and why mess with it,0
always crashes and takes forever to load since the update,0
used to work great then  weeks ago wont log in i called chase they said all is ok on their end i downloaded new app etc when i turn off wifi it works,0
no matter what troubleshooting steps i take this app crashes every time i try to log in i have no idea if its good on the inside but its pretty useless as it is,1
crashes after going into alert history this app used to work well no its plagued with problems,0
its such an easier fix for the it guys get on it already its been months since this app works i used to use it at least a hand full of times a week,0
it would be so much easier to manage this account from my phone but the app never works and always times out,0
app works great for me seems quicker as well,0
prior updates had major problems amp with so many bad reviews i dont to update the app until the reviews are decent  sick of chase forcing updates,0
i loved it up until it stopped supporting the g now i gata call to check my balance __  not a fan anymore,0
after updating i have a blank white image where the chase icon should be please fix,1
the next button is grayedout despite all of the information above being filled in  very frustratinh,1
this app is horrible it never works and i try it everyday all it says when i try to log in is we are logging you in securely please wait and it never logs in,0
very frustrating cant login since the last couple updates,0
this use to work great now throws me out every time i snapshot my check for a deposit  would really be great if this worked like all the commercials says it does,0
it finally works,0
love this app when it works unfortunately it hasnt worked in about a month,0
does not have accurate updates always pending money,0
this app worked well till the last update now it crashes when going from one page to another please fix it,0
limits amount of deposit doesnt let you log in and requires reloading  a real pain,0
app takes too long to open and save userid doesnt work,1
check deposit does not work when trying to take photo of check app shuts down and you have to relogin,0
however you should be able to send external transfers,0
use it all the time,0
when i type in the amount to xfer between my accounts the number pad doesnt disappear therefore not allowing me to submit my xfer request pointless,1
first time ive ever downloaded ye app and when i tried to lignin it said it couldnt display my account information and told me o visit the website iphone  latest ios,0
whenever i log out of the app after paying bills online the entire ipad freezes and must be reset,1
i used this app to pay bills all the time since last update im unable to im even paying late fees to chase guess im suppose to carry a laptop around too,1
can open app but when i go to log in it says cant process request at this time really wish i could log in,1
not sure why but after updates selecting an amount to pay doesnt work fix your app,1
wont allow me to make deposits  when i try to take a pic of the check it goes black and closes the app fix,1
ever since the upgrade i can log in but i cant deposit checks or make transfers pretty pointless app if it doesnt do anything,1
never had a problem  super helpful app  i love it,1
app constantly crashes or wont take a picture when i try to deposit my checks,1
if you forget your password you have a better chance of inventing a better mousetrap than resetting it,1
best part of this app used to be depositing checks by taking pictures of them for  weeks now the app crashes when i take the picture argh,1
i live the new design ,1

this app worked flawlessly until the recent update now i have to load the old app if i can find it thanks chase,0
beyond beauty now all i need is a hiding option for my user name ty,0

i go to college in dc where there are no chase banks so i need to deposit my checks through the app its not allowing me to submit a picture anymore please fix,0
rather than repeating all the other reviews i will just add my observation that the ap is broken it will not deposit checks using my iphone,1
my credit union allows k per day and chase limits deposits another reason to bank for them versus all the fees and limits imposed by the nations largest bank,0
the latest update with the new style is a turn for the worst it now seems confusing to use not happy,1
great app but missing touch id i though chase showed this off at the iphone  unveiling whats the hold up,1
i can sign in perfectly on the website but as soon as i downloaded the app im not able to sign in please fix,1
still running my trusty iphone s on ios  what does chase do as of a few days ago lock me out if i dont update and then give me no ios compatible update jackasses,1
i cant believe that this app would not be down capable i cant upgrade but i cant use the old app either,1
the old version stop working and the new one wont updatetheres still ios  users out there who just hate the interface of iosamp,1
this app is by far the worst ive ever downloaded alerts dont work crashesconsistently isnt updated with iphone  temporarily unavailable  hours a day deleting it forever off my phone now,1
they force you to upgrade to use including the ios to  this screws me up i lose my very full task manager to ios or my chase abilities if i dont horrible horrible horrible design,1
needs an update for + users it also stays with  notifications on at all times cannot be removed,1
cant downgrade either because my computer with the earlier version of this app malfunctioned and lost everything,1
when is the touchid login on ios releasing chase app is way behind in this game,1
why even give you the option to go to your ultimate rewards when it just loads a blank page and no touch id,1
i am not sure why this app has no map view for nearby atms and banks  id give it stars for that,1

just got around to checking my accounts and trying to transfer some funds but no cant do wow what a bad update please fix please asap,1
even though it picks up the rt and account number it repeatedly states image too poor to accept,1
im tired of your constant updates jeez the app is working why do you update so often thats my only issue id give you more stars if you stopped that,1
love the app but theres too many frequent mandatory updates,1
seriously whats with the constant updates i wish i could for once open the app and use it instead of having to download an update every single time,1
so the app forces me to update  twice  and now it crashes immediately every time i try to open it so its completely unusable bravo citi good thing im about to close my citi card anyway,1
and fire whoever thought it was a great idea very unprofessional and not consumer friendly to show ads in your banking app,1
this app is so annoying how hard is it to make a good working app will not allow me to create a password makes me wish i didnt even get this dang card ,1

every time i have to pay my bill i have to dig out my password because touch id is broken enable it  sure  it will work for a week  then it breaks horrible,1
mobile deposit is horrible  it keeps asking to retake pics  wellsfargo has it figured out on the tech front,1
touch id mysteriously turns off constantly forcing me to reset password every time  extremely annoying,1
helps me handle all my finances on the go,1
well functioning ap,1
i think it works exactly the way it should,1
real good app makes banking easier ,1
any time and any moment,1
not a bad app but it could be a lot better   why must i navigate away from my loan to make a payment  the only way i can find the total amount due for my car loan is to pull up the last statement why is that info hiddenkeep improving,1

the update screwed this app up big time its one of the only reasons i use this bank person to person and check deposit from the phone fix this or re release the older version,1

ive been using this app for about  months and now when i updated it it just shows a blue screen i use this app almost everyday fix it now,0
new app wont even load on my phone im sure itll be fixed and i loved the app before,0

update oct st  non functional with newest update keeps saying connection problem or something when i try to log in app is useless right now,0
was forced to update now check deposit no longer works,0
latest update indicates support for iphone  and  plus but this is not the case  the resolutions still are not supported  will update review once this has been done,0
it does what its supposed to but iphone  compatibility would be nice as well as touch id login,0
needs more resolution doesnt seem optimized for the new phones,1

this future wont let you pass taking the picture the use bottom wont work,0

you can see the amount appear the list of the checksbut you cannot see the image of the checki wrote in the past to correct this problem the result is no correction appeared,1

my app doesnt have a quick deposit feature cool the only reason why i wanted this app and it doesnt have the feature on my phone like it shows on its preview lol,0
alerts wont clear out annoying someone fix this fix the entire app,1
since the upgrade when i try to deposit a check it will not take the amount it zeros out  not happy,1
not able to deposit bc the amount tab keeps zeroing itself out,1
this app used to work before they updated it now it says i have no accounts to view update has rendered this app useless ,1
this app is very useful and i convinced most of my friends to download it,0
this was the app i used every dayfor all my banking needsbut since the last update its not working at allplease fix it,1
it was working just fine until last update,0
this was a great appwhen it opens since i upgraded my phone from a  to a s it simply crashes as soon as you try and open it,1
i used to use this app all the time now it shuts down when i try to see my activity i even deleted and reinstalled the app didnt help so annoying,0
#NAME?,1
hate that they force you to update and lo and behold it crashes i typically dont update until there have been positive reviews but no choice here,0
every time i click on my account it starts to load then shuts the app off you cant see what transactions youve made,0
cant say enough good things about it,1
please male it easier to erase the alerts,1
makes banking easy,0
the transfer feature isnt working whatsoever,0
this at one point was a great app it crashes and some transactions just dont work anymore needs many bug fixes and defeats the purpose of convince,0
i do enjoy and use it a lot,0
crashes when i enter amount for quick deposit,0
this is a great program,0
please fix as everyone else mentioned the app does not work properly after,1
its good we are getting better on the apos,0
this ap was by far my favorite until i updated my phone cant deposit or do anything besides see balance please fix it,0
i used to use this app everyday now it blows i cant even log onto it anymore and when i do it wont show me any of my recent account activity its a piece of doodoo,1
please update so it can take advantage of the new iphones bigger screen,0
chase branch in the palm of my hand must have,1
this app was great now i cant deposit it times out often and has almost become useless please fix,0
ever since ios  update will not log in too many problems   beyond frustrated,0
for a company that claims to have the best banking app this is a joke ever since the update to ios i cant log into my account i keep getting an error connection time out app was great before,0
latest version still doesnt work its been months now maybe its time to move to the credit union,0
cannot make a deposit with the camera anymore,0
this app is horrible i have only been able to load the app twice every other time i have been timed out just another reason to switch banks,0
why can i not make a payment all of a sudden,0
how many people have to complain before you fix the app get it together im not able to give no stats but you get the picture,0
well this app did everything before the developer decided to release a downgrade now i cant even log in fix bugs please,0
app is awesome when it actually opens and doesnt crash,0
the update is supposed to fix amp correct flaws that the app has not make them worse cant log in at home with my wifi ,0
i love this app i really do but the time out every time i try to log in drives me nuts surely there has to be a fix for this,0
as others have said this used to be a great app  it worked fine until i updated to ios  yesterday on iphone   please fix,0
app hasnt worked since update what is this nonsensedoesnt let you log in im at home on an encrypted wifi network,0
keeps crashing when i deposit checks please fix,0
it was working perfectly fine up until this latest so called upgrade it wont finish the new installation cant do anything anymore,0
crashes now whenever trying to deposit a check  wait for the new version,1
ever since the last update the app just doesnt work neither does it work on the ipad dont waste your time login through website,0
i havent been able to use this app in weeks the wifi bug fixed didnt work now even on lte it wont function,0
many tasks say temporarily unavailable try again later has been like this for weeks,0
you dont need the app because it gives you nothing more than the mobile sitewhich is useless too,0
this is probably the only app where i need it to just consistently work it does not this thing feeds me unable to log on to chase please try again later thanks for your patience  times put of  its forcing me to change banks grr get your it together megabank,0
i cant even pay my bill through the app which is the whole point of having it,0
should be able to see my secure messages through it dont see why not,0
ive been using this app for a long time with no problems but the new update isnt compatible with my somewhat older ipod anymore,0
great app but when i try to transfer the keyboard would not lower and making me unable to complete transfer ,0
seems like this would have been tested prior to releasing pretty frustrating not being able to use it at all,1
make deposil limit to  a month add deposit limit to show before you enter amout and take pictures makes me so angry when i try to deposit a check a check entering all info and took pictures of  both side than it tell you than you have limit why not to show limit before trying to do deposit,1
great app been using for a year,0
the app is great but ive also been having a problem with the number pad disappearing is it just me or is anyone else having this problem too,1
but now it crashes every time i try to take a picture of a check for a deposit please fix this it used to be such a time saver for me,1
the app crashes very often otherwise  well there is no otherwise it crashes also dont force me for upgrade,1
i cant take the picture for the check or it will crash,1
every time i try to use the check deposit feature the app crashes when i try to take a picture,1
it keeps closing every time i try to make a deposit  very annoying,1
why is everyone including me mad that the chase app has been sucking lately you already know they dont care one bit about you,1
there needs to be an option to use a pin to login just copy the functionality from usaa and discover,1
the new version of the app looks awful its hard to look at unpleasant to use and over all stupid it reminds me of key banks app joe and that app it the worst way to take an amazing app and layout and make it awful,1
i love this new update looks and works smoothly ,1

i love how easy it is to maneuver and all the options awesome,1
amazing fast and user friendly,0
i like this app easy to use,0
it is easy to use first time but love it,0
best bank application very resourcesfull and helpfull absouletly the best app must have,0
like i said this latest update is causing immediate hangs and then a crash on load come on guys fix this,0
be prepared to wait up to  days for your deposit and customer service cant help you with anything quick deposit  ha  thats funny,0
do not update if possible app wont even let me log in to my account now says temporarily unavailable each time i try so annoying,1
the new app is crap it doesnt response gets frozen cant slide the screen to view the menu the old version was great such a technical disappointment for a leading financial institution,1
why havent you added support for touch id youre the only holdout in all the apps i use you support applepay which uses touch id why not your app,0
it does not have the resolution update for the  plus i thought that was the point of the update,1
ive been using the chase app and its been great but now its time to optimize for iphone  amp implement touch id,0
with the nov  version i cannot deposit checks from my iphone s,0
since the update the submit button does not work therefore i can not deposit checks,0
this app was working great up until the latest update the useand retake buttons are not working for check photos,0
i can never get my checks deposited the use and retake buttons dont work when taking the pictures its been like this for weeks now,0
virtual deposit checks and ultimate reward for credit card are not working,1
after the latest update virtual check deposit does not work only reason i ever really used the app,1
i like the new additions but until these features are added this app feels old please update,1
please bring touch id to the log in process,1
good but still not optimized for iphone  amp +,1
this app is useless to me since the deposit feature no longer works im considering switching banks,1
i wish the app had a four digit password upon login like the discover app does,1
the new version doesnt wok in older ios i am not able to log in now,1
no longer works with ipod touch  very disappointed as i had been using mobile deposit regularly,1
ive been temporarily unable to connect for months what gives,1
the quick deposit feature doesnt even work reliably,1
this app used to be helpful until chase decided to force an update that makes the thing incompatible with my phone now its totally useless,1
if would be great if you could log into your app using the touch id on the iphone,1
touch id needs to be added to this application,1
when will you add touch id to your app,1

so now that chase updated their app people with older iphones cannot use it i dont think that its fare im not buying a new phone just to use their app fix it and dont discriminate,0
enough said,0
i love this app but since the update i have gotten timed out errors when i try to log in please fix this problem,0
ive used the app with the old i phone foe about two year and now i can well here another reason for me to let leave chase bank,0
they took over  billion in bailout money and they cant make an app that workswould you expect anything less from these criminals,0
worthless  can only log into this app about  of the time  dont have this problem with any other bank app  do better chase,0
doesnt work via wifi but confirmed it does if you go to cell data usage  what a bummer,0
i opened a checking account and my bank rep said i should try the new app its great  little did she know the app developers must have been hired from a cracker jack talent pooli cant even get logged innice work idiots,0
cant login at all iphone s+ios  is it too much to ask to test the app before releasing it,0
i was wondering why the rating was so low now i seeit simply doesnt allow me to log in i hope they fix this soon,0
my review will have to be a poor this app never works times out and it not convenient at all they need to fix the bugs in it and put it on hold until it works ,0
i can never login to my account on this app it always says the request has timed out please try again later,0
so app used to work ok but now i can never log in so they advertise a feature like mobile check cashing but cant even get into the app to do so,0
contacted chase about this weeks ago they dont know why and arent able to fix it app is now completely useless,0
this was such a good app until i updated to ios  since i updated the app times out when logging in on g and encrypted wifi and makes it unusable its a shame,0
still doesnt work with wifi deleted it and wont ever use it until they get this problem fixed,0
whoever decided to push through the update is a complete idiot and needs to be relieved of their positionway to screw up the app chase epic fail,0
this app does not work it just gives me a message about how chase is temporarily unable to connect to the server dont even waste your time,0
is there anything worse and more embarrassing than what chases app has become  for all of the reasons people have charitably given this thing one star the answer is no,0
app doesnt seem to work i havent been able to even log on it gives a message were temporarily unavailable constantly  please fix amp update this app,0
too many stupid updates i just wanna open the app check my balance and be done,0

it was the best app always worked  now  there is an issue with keyboard being stuck so you cant do transfer etc  fix it pls ,0
something got broken in most recent version accounts dont show balance properly,1
since the update  cannot see activity on my accounts  app will only show current balance,0

the new update does not allow for transfers to be available immediately i tried to transfer on the th the earliest transfer sate was the th that is not cool,0
if youre listening how about chase stops remodeling old wamus to put in lcd tvs new flooring and new counters and spend a little money merging their database so wamu customers can use this too,0
i think this quick deposit idea is genious finally something useful not so stupid invention i am staying with chase forever,1
i love this app snapping pics of check is fantastic,0
i was told by chase representatives that if i was a wamu customer i dont get to use the new quick deposit feature  time to change banks,0
i luv this app and luv the quick deposit,1
the pictures of the checks would not be accepted and uploaded even after trying repeatedly very disappointed,1
after going through  id numbers sent to me to verify my device i still couldnt login and it locked me out if my account app deleted,0
this app was very useful until the os geheime staatspolizei determined that  users that can not or will not upgrade their os were not worthy i would have given this app five stars if i were still allowed to use it,1
i use it all the time but now it opens and i enter my user name and ow and the program stops and closes,0
its good when it works but it is always going down at night time they need to fix that but over all it a good app,0
this app only works one time out of ten  rejects most pictures and has a low limit on the amount it will acceptneeds a lot of work,0
often times itd be faster just to go to bank since i have to retake the photo  or  times before it even works if it even does,0

first time using this app amp it has work out so good thanks ,1
super easy and awesome app,1
this app is absolutely horrible now the update completely ruined it,1
it always works for me,1
check deposit is the best,1
it always crashes on me  out of  times when i try to open it its temporarily unavailable  so annoying,1
best app ever used and user friendly,1
great app i use it all the time,1
great ui secured transactions and easy to use,1
a special thanks to the developers for continuing to improveaccessibility for the visually impaired via voiceover apples software screenreading solution for the blind and low vision  sincerely mark,1
works great nice interface,1
ill preface this with that i love chase and the functionality of the app is great however the new ui is a disappointment compared to the previous ui which looked great although the new ui isnt horrible it seems like they just changed it for the sake of changing it rather than to provide any benefits in particular the accounts page has too much empty space the tiles or panels look like they were borrowed from a template they bought somewhere that werent actually designed for the content within them or to follow the theme of the rest of the app also adding a button to now see more than  previous transactions is a negative change to the ux why add more effort in a poor attempt to barely clean up the ui meanwhile the rest of the app still appears to look exactly the same such as the menu bill pay and depositing checks im just so confused why the main accounts page was changed  just to confuse people im  so change isnt something im afraid of and im a fullstack developer not that im a uiux designer but still this seems like a mistake someone on that team shouldve spoken up about redeeming award points still opens up a separate web page which is frustrating and something they should be focusing on enhancing the experience of instead of changing ui that already functioned great maybe im missing something that made the change worthwhile either way i love chase and still like the app but just kind of frustrated enough so to write a review as someone that never writes reviews be careful what you focus on to improve the app and make sure whatever you change has a benefit instead of just giving ui designers something to work on,1
we can tap the fingerprint icon to stunning the touch id dialog much nicer,1
very easy nice app cant ask for more,1

amazing app makes banking so easy,0
best mobile banking app out there,0
very convenient for me love this app,0
so far i havent been able to log in chase site works fine in iphones browser which makes this app beyond pointless,1
the main screen and the logon screen are the best parts about this application as far as actual effort interacting with your account once youve logged in is useful to the extent that it is intuitive yes you can view your account balances yes you can review transactions upon your account but all in such a very basic and unimpressive way that suggests that they simply do not care the app literally just loads a mobile version of their website into the app thus making their app into a basic browser that can only view this poorly constructed version of their primary website the website that is loaded looks like something a  year old could cook with basic html and no design experience think websites from the mid to late s while there are no obvious functional flaws in what it can do the app could use a big makeover by a designerprogrammer i doubt they required a team to come up with this app who actually cares about what heshe is producingi would take the time to list some improvements that i would like to see in the app if i honestly thought that the programmerchase didnt already realize how lacking this app is and how easily they could make it better hell you guys are a bank youve got plenty of resources at your disposal and plenty of reasons to make it easier for people to spend i mean come on guys you invented a way of telling people how much money they have in their accounts without being held liable when the number is wrong i guess what im saying is why dont you use all of those completely bull overdraft fees to make our banking experience betteryes this is version  yes its free and yes they do have tons of moneyall that being said i dont find this app any more useful than the ability to text my account i can text my account the words bal or hist and essentially achieve the same thing as this app that leaves transferring money and wire transfers i believe both of these can be achieved in chases mobile version of their website which can be accessed from safari this app only makes logging into that website quicker and slightly more intuitive but as i said earlier once youve logged in its the same terrible websiteso what did chase make here they made a pretty login screen that is a few clicks closer to the same mobile website oh but they have that way cool atm finder admittedly this is the most original portion of the app but even then it is only useful to the extent that it can be used by that i mean you are at the mercy of the app finding your correct location the first time without the ability to refresh this location and then you only see some atms and branches i get  on average they are probably the closest ones but that only satisfies a few situations in which people need a bank or atm more advanced search options as well as the ability to see the results overlayed onto a map or exported into google maps would be ideal but im not holding my breathbefore this app i would text my account bal to see how much money i have in my accounts its just as reliable as chases primary website or hist if i wasnt sure why my balance was what it was to find atms or branches i would simply use google maps the comparable features of this app do not accomplish these things any more intuitively or even in a prettier way so until they make it a more intuitive convenient and pleasant experience theres not much left for this app to accomplish as far as the average joe is concerned,0
i didnt even update to  and it no longer works you cant leven log in and the location finder has not worked in days,0
this app worked at one point does anyone know when an update is coming,1
i have signned up for moblie banking and i can not even connect to my accounts i could get better results asking a magic  ball this app is worthless,0
cannot log in from iphone keeps saying wrong login password combo no problems logging in using desktop perhaps due to being a wamu client,0

app used to work great but now i havent been able to access it for weeksit consistently times out super irritating,0
this app was a lot better when i could log in i wish their updates hadnt broken the app please fix,0
it used to work so well but after the recent update whenever i log on after a few seconds a screen pops up that says the request timed out if they can fix that bug or whatever is causing that then its a great app for now use your web browser from a computer,1
app is useless at least until this login problem is fixed,0
worked fine until recent updates doesnt work anymore,0

cant connect over wifi works fine on cellular network,0
can no longer log in but i still get the annoying alerts,0
one of the worst apps out there  why make a chase app if you can never use it i cant log on or look at my accounts  please fix this,0
app works fine unless im home and connected to wifi then it wont log in,0
dont waste your time i havent been able to log on for months will not recognize my log in or password,0

how annoying that with the update the auto fix doesnt work anymore please fix,0
even better than before can see investment movements now,0
even after fix still cant log in log in page loads continuously,0
the lack of a map view to see multiple locations limits this apps usefulness to almost nothing,0
with all of the less than stellar reviews why would customers be forced to update by july   i like the version i have,0
i tried to pay my credit card amp it doesnt let me since im set up on autopay pretty useless app in my opinion,0
this new  actualization do not works at all because when you get into do not appear the amount of the checking count,0
why did it just changeit looks lame and cheap give us the blue back or at least an updated version of the blue icon,0
every time i open the app and type in my password it says that it is unavailable right now  please fix,0
the app will open up but when i login it will not work very disappointed,1

how do i sign up,1
needs to be optimized for iphone ,1
this app was never great but now it requires you have the most recen ios installed to use it   a very short sighted an nonuser friendly decision  i am done with  chase bank,1
keep on updating every few weeks have to download again,1
great app but it could use touch id all my other financial providers have it ,1
whats the user name its asking me for ,1
so the basic features are there to pay your card but my amex app is miles ahead of this one instant purchase notifications on amex better resolution on iphone  plus oh yeah and touchid login,1

could use thumbprint identification to log in,1
after the app with iphone  plus locks me out of my touch id ability it refuses to accept a manual log in and tells me it does not recognize my credentials then i spend  minutes trying to create a new password as it is very difficult to create one that is acceptable then i have to call customer service that has to resetunlock my account and then it works fine until the next time my touch id failsa new case with the developers should be created as per the upper level customer support the next time this happens it has occurred  times in the last  months poorly designed app,0

after the recent update the app crashes every time i try to deposit a check,1
what happened now the app tells me i need to update my phone before it will work my phone used to be just fine for compatability,1
i am unable to sign in and unable to make deposits  this is a major problem,1
cant deposit a check without it crashing or receiving a cant connect to chase error,1
one of the biggest banks and they cant fix this issue everyone is having its been long enough fix it,1

what has happened why is this occurring,0
have you ever been here chase app development people are you kidding no atms found in my area as i stand within  feet of about  of them are you guys high,0
when u try to log in it takes forever to load then says theres an error dont bother getting this app,1
it hasnt been working for days what is the point of having an app if it doesnt work come on,0
i have an older iphone and cant update to the new ios and now i cant manage my funds thank you so much chase,0
i came to rely on the chase ap suddenly its not available unless i update ios which i dont want to do,0
i have latest software update ios  and it times out every time used to work now it doesnt,0

the app rarely connects as your request to log on will time out  a poor app for a poor bank  dont trust it to work,0
constantly times out can rarely log in please fix,0
there is always a timeout error when i try to load the app thanks chase,0
try testing apps b you launch them old app was better never gave me issues,1
there is no point to have this app i havent been able to log on for months wasted space,0
last time i checked temporarily unavailable didnt mean never available  what happened  this used to be the best app on my phonefix this chasenow,1
yeah does stuff decently well,0
please put more effort in fixing these bugs it makes it so much more frustrating,0

still on old ios and when i open up the app a black screen just pops up cannot sign in ,1
awesome app  cant complain ,1
app keeps closing during deposits on my s,1
such a beautiful update truly impressed great job,1
the ui is not user friendly it is very distractive the older one was far better and to the point what we need this is too extraneous   ,1
the app was great but the new update makes your accounts look unorganized and confusing,1
app keeps crashing when trying to deposit,0
please go back to the old style much easier to view before i updated wish i hadnt,1
what was wrong with the old version you know the one that actually showed a running balance i hate it,1

incredibly frustrating very little functionality,1
chase supports apple pay touch id for me to spend my money at merchants how come i cannot use touch id to check my accounts standing in a more secure and quicker manneri will admit that swiping to the left is ingenious bout touch id would overall be the faster and more secure method once touch id does come out please bring it out i will immediately shut the swipe gesture off swipe is a catch  check my acct balances quick but risk having an unknowing nosey individual swipe and see where my money stands,1
everythings just right on your finger,1

this app its amazingly good,1
enough said,0
what a disappointment  i use an ipad  this version is for a iphone,1
good app just what i needed,1
not a true iphone app needs more functionality and ui work,0
this is a really bad app needs so much more chases mobile stuff is useless just give iphones back the regular site,0
great concept but mine keeps logging out please fix,0
why dont i have the desposit button at the bottom thats pretty much the whole reason i downloaded this app,0
i love it u make my life easy   thank u so much,0
wont even let me log in i can log in on the computer right away but not with the app,0
tried to update today application update stalled,0
terrible app does not function at all,0
it is defiantly the best banking app out there,1
the iphone cannot take a picture that chase would recognize waste like everything else,1
i wont recommend banking with chase i had a checking account for a while after they bought out wamu and i still have a credit card with them but i will say this app is one of the best offered for credit cardsbank accounts state farm bank and yes they do actually have a bank allows me to deposit checks through the phone but their implementation is clunky compared to chases but at least they have it which is why i moved my checking account from chase to them and the more news i hear about chase  like limiting debit purchases to  dollars  the more im happy i am no longer banking with them the app is really the only thing i miss about chasethe review written below though was from when i had a checking account and a credit card with them chase has done a lot to improve this app over time when i first got it it was so basic it was just a rehash of their mobile websiteanyways theyve much improved it and i love the check depositing feature not sure why some people are told you need a business checking account or can not use it on free checking cause im pretty sure i have their most basic checking account and i know i dont have a business checking account and its worked fine for me it does seem to take a few days for the deposit to take effect so if you need the money right away it may be better off to just go to the bank but for some one like me that tends to take weeks to go to the bank even when i have a check to deposit it is still quicker than relying on me getting to the bank anytime soon,0
this app is really usefuli never had any problem using it  star,0
so where is my quick deposit tab shown in the pictures above,0
what the heck is going on  i cant log onstill having issues,1

i dont hate it,1
not working it takes too long to log onthen times out  not good for iphone,1
since the newest update i have to input my user info each time i use the app its an inconvenience please fix it,1
poor execution and by that im referring to the fact that if it even opens it refuses to accept simple things like deposits etc,1

update sept    this app is the best i have seen i opened an account at chase in  due to this app and closed my wells fargo accounts  suggestions for improvement         add chase quickpay to the d touch menu option right now if you use d touch you get an option to search for atmbank locations it would be great to have quickpay added to that menu for easy access to pay friends at restaurants etc            provide option on chase quickpay where you do not have to manually accept money received every time have a setting for auto accept for already established recipients  pros         well laid out user interface very easy to use         mobile deposit bill pay wire transfers         chase is great at maintaining this mobile app so it is always current stable and ready for new versions of ios  when there have been some bugs chase is quick to get a fix pushed out             transfer funds between chase accounts and between chase and external nonchase bank accounts         chase quickpay similar to pay pal and no charge  great feature for paying friends money for food tab etc  this feature has improved recently if the destination bank is also a member of clearxchange the funds will frequently move instantly between chase and nonchase accounts           speed of app in moving between screens and network communications is very good         overall i feel chase sets the bar for digital  mobile banking even the chase website is excellent very well laid out and visually pleasing like the mobile app          touch id unlocks nearly all functions i have tried so far big improvement in the past it basically allowed you to log in  but you still had to provide manual password when you wanted to pay bills etc   chase has nailed the digital banking hands down great job,1

im a technical person who works for a competing bank  ive been with chase or what its called now for nearly  years   they were not the first with a mobile app or the best for a long time but in the last years they have obviously learned from other banks and put money into the development of this entire infrastructure  the result is what i would say is perhaps the best if only rivaled by usaa mobile app  the ability to see all your accounts and quickly get the details is a daily feature i use and as perfect as it can be  i cant think of any way to improve it  using touch with my finger print is convenient way to securely log in and do the basics  as a programmer and security person i can appreciate the extra login when paying bills  direct deposit by taking pictures with checks has sometime in the past been glitchy but it seems most of those bugs are worked out  transferring between accounts is very nice and used often   if there is anything to add to the mobile app it may be a few features that the web site can perform  like the ability to add other accounts or manage my profile or password  seeing images of checks is great   i use to be a proof operant and the imaging technology to make this happen and store it in a database is really cool   i am also a sql dba and can appreciate all the alerts and related information being stored about my accounts profiles activity inbox alerts and much more   truly and excellent jobhighest respect to the mobile team at chase and the entire infrastructure teams that make all of the products at chase available nears xxwintel sysadminsstoragedba team of courseweb programmersnet teamperformance and analysis teamnetwork adminshardware and data center teamsbusiness analystsquality testersdata warehouse managersand senior managers keeping an eye on how the world works and bringing the best possible applications with the most functionality and simplified useoh and not to forget the dialers and all the incoming and outgoing streams for business to consumer like emails online chat and customer servicechase is doing an excellent jobmy other top mobile apps areusaa my saving insurance are hereciti my company and where i have my mortgageother apps that arent quite doing it as well are wells fargous bankand one final suggestioni use mint  great for combing banks and finances in one placei use to be able to tie all by financial institutions with one app  many years ago it required me setting up my profile and adding the main app or bank and any if and password  then in one place i could get my entire financial picture including ira kand mint can provide suggestions and alerts it may see that you spent more in online shopping and suggest you to review and remind you of your budget  it may show you how you are charting towards your savings or retirement goal and make suggestions  these are cool features and things i wish i had all in one place or otherwise i have to keep up with my own excel spreadsheet thanks for all the creative and tenacious people with strong desires to improve and create the best user experience and challenge the industry and yes even my company to be better faster and more agile in todays data intensive world,1

password mnguyen,0
needs deposit feature there are two cameras,0
i love it very convenient buttt when i tried to update my chase it stalled for a longgggggg time ughhh,1
also to jason who commented about funds transfer it does work but you must set it up on the actual website i transfer funds to my credit card all the timeso so so convenient i made the switch from capital one about two months ago and im mad it took me so long not only is my banking with chase so are multiple credit cards and my car lease all can be accessed and monitored with this app including all statements transactions and payments  the quick deposit feature is awesome great time saver and only about a hr turnaround before deposits are available same as an inperson check deposit those who are saying its not working must not be doing right even though the directions are very simple to follow i love this app chase has left capital dumb in the dust keep up the great worknew this app is as good as ever completely worthy of  stars im constantly impressing coworkers and friends with this app i have a feeling that most of the poor reviews are from older customers who are not so tech savvy and the reviews about things such as pending purchases and visible account balances must be stupid or blind wether i make a purchase with my debit card and use my pin or as a credit transaction it is reflected in my balance immediately some transactions such as gas or some restaurants do not appear immediately but that is because of the vendor and not chase all gas pumps preauthorize your account for  because they dont know how much gas youll need the full charge appears a few days later again not chases fault i always read reviews for apps before i make a purchase i feel that most of the poor reviews for this app are likely due to user malfunctions and not the app itself almost a year later and this app is still out shining other banking apps this is the future of banking keep up the great work j p morgan,1

i love chase app is very combined for me i love it ,1
works great,1
i have better finance related apps such as pnc need to adopt touch id,1
easy to use,1
i like the push notifications amp the ability to check the balance amp transactions  but while i find i receive a notification for my payments at a store instantly there are some payments debits by me from my account  not very large ones  that come through that i miss or do not see a notice for them i have at least in one case checked my account the night before amp woke up the next morning to find that it had showed up amp i was fined  by chase my budget is so tight that this is really painful financially secondly i get paid through a debit card that is not under chase amp use that account to accumulate money to pay my mortgage so that chase does not accidentally take the money for something else i do not understand why when the other card tells me the transfer was made to chase that chase takes at least  days to have this deposit register in my chase account by comparison note that my instore transactions show up immediately amp go through that night but not this transfer of money from a debitonly card then i get dinged for a late payment that was not late when i tried to transfer the money i also do not understand why i cant make the mortgage payment directly from my other account from wherever i am amp the moneys there in the other account i think its another opportunity for chase to levy a finelastly ive used the photo deposit feature which works well but once i was going out of town to pa guess what theres not one chase branch in all of pa or within  miles of my location at least in  or  when i was there because my account had slightly overdrawn chase would not allow me to to photo deposit so i had to wait until i came home to deposit the check in person resulting in more than one  fine i was sooooo angry this is another instance where they slow down the deposit end resulting in fines  for no good reason in my mind they could fix thisoverall i like the app but find the way deposit transactions amp at times deductions wout notification are handled i do give them credit for reversing some of the fines when i complained but thats limited to a certain number annually,0

appmuchconvenientso nice,1
i have a new iphone  have enabled touch id but the chase app no longer gives me the option to log on with a fingerprint and worse than that entering my password never works i then go through the process of identifying myself to creat a new password however no matter what combination of letters numbers characters i use the app will not accept anything so i then call customer service speak to someone overseas and explain my issue that person gives me that standard basics ends up transferring me to another overseas agent that also cant help then finally they transfer me to the us for technical help and eventually the problem is solved i get log in but the same thing happens next time i try to access my account and i waste another  to  minutes going through the same annoying time consuming process and this has happened now at least  or  times in a row so ive given up on the app and will switch my account to different bank even if they dont have an app why waste so much time not sure why with the iphone  i had a s before and never had any problemsupdate since last review i still cant ever access my account using the mobile app as it still wont take my password even went to chase branch same thing kept happening to them get new password log out cant log back in will change banks as soon i can sort out all the automatic payments etc very surprised chase could allow such an important issue to be unresolved,1
and their customernoservice too,1

great app deserves a  star,0
the best hands down,1
does the basic functions of a banking app just not impressed by it,1
very good and extremely useful  great way to check your accounts and monitor for security  i check it several times a day and pay most of my bills on the app  one flaw is only being able to post one payment to a chase account per day  i sometimes want to post two payments to one account in one day  due to changes in personnel do not like any of them at that branch anymore i rarely go to my local branch  the app helps me avoid the people who currently work therewrote above a while back  its still a great and very useful appupdate to above  still love the app although i have a few questions and need to go in to local branch  need to find another with personnel who are nicer  those in my closest branch are uncooperative once they found i will not transfer other accounts from another bank back to them  they are the main reason i wont move those accounts to chase but they dont seem to be able to figure that out  maybe chase needs to clean house at that branchi have now found another branch where the personnel are extremely nice and helpful  i still think the branch which is closest to me needs a house cleaning  when going to the drivethrough i gave my business request to the person behind the glass  then another customer drove up in the lane next to me in a very large more expensive newer vehicle than my camry submitted their request and as i sat there waiting the other customer was taken care of before me and drove off  i was still waiting and asked why the other customer was given preferential treatment only to be told they were in a hurry  actually i was on the way to a charity event and was in a hurry myself but had no reason to tell that to anyone at the bank  i was offended to not be taken care of when it was my turn  perhaps the personnel at that branch need further trainingthe app helps me keep track of my accounts quite easily despite a few occasions when it says the mobile app is temporarily unavailable  i do wish you could improve thatif anyone at chase reads these reviews please note i amended several previous paragraphs,0

good,1
please note the ios  change to the camera is not  accurate for check deposits  the image is rejected and submitted anywaythe app is too limited in its usefulness  quick deposits are unnecessarily limited  it would be possible to send text confirmations of all quick deposits to known partiesi continue to find the mobil app to limited  quick deposits could easily be verified by text to known parties there by removing the  limit  if one needs to go into a branch for banking what is the value of a mobil appthe mobil app continues to be less than useful it could and should monitor all debt card transactions real time  instead of just showing a static balance there should be a notification of the exact transaction as fast as the terminal will permit  for example knowing a check has cleared three days after it is written is probably going to be seldom used being able to authenticate a debt transaction even if it takes five minutes or more would be really usefulthere are to many adds appearing on the login screen in this recent review of the chase mobil app i find the addition of ads may be contributing to errors in the parallax of pictures of checks for deposits  there could be as much as a  parallax errorthe current version of chase mobil app suffers from a persistent problem with deposit checks  it should be possible to autophoto which would remove shaky images  i believe auto scan is the software neededthis app is currently functional however the trend too integral adds is annoying,1

 update lowering my rating to  stars because the alerts functionality needs a redesign if you have multiple accounts in my case a checking savings loan and  credit cards theres no way to know which account has a new alert without going to each one individually  this is a real pain im really impressed with this app so far  its easy to use fairly quick and has an attractive layout and designbefore i go any further i feel obligated to give the developers a bravo for how they implemented the feature to find nearby atms and branch locations  like numerous apps it uses the phones location services aka gps to determine where you are at the moment  however theyve done this in a way thats far superior to every other locationaware app ive tried  how so  once the app has determined your location it immediately turns off the gps receiver ie the directional arrow icon disappears  as gps is probably the biggest consumer of battery power this feature is genius  even apples apps leave the gps on until you exit or return to the home screeni have used the app to review transactions in my account and even to deposit a check using the camera on my iphone   the deposit process was really slick easy to understand and it worked perfectly the first time  in my case i had one of those oversized checks that you get from a corporation so i was concerned that the dimensions would make it hard to successfully photograph using the apps highlighted blue outline  but it worked without a hitchtwo improvements i would like to see it would be nice to have a small graphic showing a padlock when youre logged in to your account  safari shows this for secure web sites so it would be nice to have a visual indicator in the app  but it should only be visible when youre logged in not when youre in a nonsecured section of the app i have my chase online profile set up to let me transfer money tofrom external bank accounts  currently the app doesnt have a way to do this so i have to log in to the chase web site to do it  this feature would round out the functionality of the app quite well  then the developers can retire in glory ,1

 update the new version is not only not pleasing too look at on the accounts screen with extra space so i have to scroll more the transfer was wonky so i went back to the left navigation old school way since the other didnt show the accounts i wanted my touch id stops working randomly thats annoying then it kind of froze and i was able to do things so i signed off and ill move my accounts to the star mobile app i helped design and ran at a cu i wish they wouldnt have pushed it out the door please get rid of that useless top banner advertising that i cant closecancel does nothing and we should be able to minimize itand looks like something hijacked your top part of your app i cant even close the ad so i have more real estate i ask you is it about the member experience or your profit this version is the worst in about  yrs that ive been banking via mobile hire a new teampleaseformer infothe last build had multiple issues that i reported yesterday with ios  and one is the new promo at the top was not communicated to us or internal staff presignon the no thanks doesnt trigger an event to stop it from recurring presignon they broke my setting for touch id due to the way they built the release what happened to qa and internal communications i had to prove and direct two of your support teams to the promo to show them its not a virus on my phone it also took me  mins and talking with three people to get them to believe me  i am experience at developing and testing mobile apps i knew others might need help so i called so rather than trying to blame the customers phone and telling them to reinstall listen to what they are telling you most importantly test thoroughly and communicate prior to the next build please,0

down app,1
any app that prompts me for a review more than once gets a onestar review,1
i like the app have used it for several years extremely convenient for person to person payments and especially for check deposits but after several years in the app store the features that once were new and exciting are now table stakes everybody has them and several that ought to be available by now arent some issues on my list arewhile the notifications feature works well their alerts messages within the app needs to be redesigned firstly if it really is an alert then why is access to it hidden away in the hamburger menu so far down that you need to scroll to get to it if it is urgent to look at have it up on the main screen someplace easy to get to and before you have the opportunity to get distracted by other information secondly if you have multiple accounts checking credit cards etc linked to this app theres no way to tell which account youve got an alert for reading the alerts doesnt seem to tell you anything particularly since most of them seem to be of the statement now available for review type of nonmeaningful messages my hope is that theyll be able to show the number of alerts you have for each account separately and restrict the alerts to occurrences against which a users action is neededthe secure message section of the app is also very poorly designed it often just shows you a blank screen and when you do get to see the messages theyre so innocuous you really wonder why they are considered so secure transfer functionality desperately needs to be upgraded now not having interbank transfers in the first few releases of the app was understandable but its been years since the initial release time to add that capability now search functionality is pathetic search by a payee name isnt even an option touch id is restricted to one account only if you have more than one account typing the uidpwd is required for the other accounts why just give me a choice of which account i want to use after touch id verifies my identity also when you log out of an account but dont quit the app the touch id prompt doesnt appear again on the login screen chase need to have a mobile update strategy to continually improve the app its been too many years now for too little advancement,1
the app is useless i might as well call,1

update still unable to deposit checks through the app resulted to camera lighting and a tripod attached to the phone  you can zoom in and see the microfibers in the check itself but the app still lists it as too blurry probably going to just switch now that several other banks have a much better mobile banking optionsupdate nine months later and the mobile deposits arent much better  almost all my paper checks go into my other bank with better mobile deposit app and im slowly transitioning away from chase  theyve got a lot of other products i like but for some reason people keep giving me paper checks and this app is a nogo for that  no way to override when it reads the wrong micr number line incorrectly or has problems reading the amount  seems they dont have a manual review if the system cant read it  too badthis app used to be a great way to stay out of the branch  check balances look up transactions pay your credit card all from the phone and on the go which was nice  check deposits without a visit to the branch was amazing but since the most recent update it stopped working  it either crashes or says the check photo was not clear enough and that i need to visit the branch  luckily another bank i use added the feature to their app and so i just deposit checks through that app instead  one area where it is particularly bad are notifications which dont seem to actually notify you of something like a low balance deposit large purchase etc until a day or so after the triggering event  not really helpful if youve already had time to discover and fix the issue on your own before the app pops up a notification  all though this may be a larger problem with the chase system as opposed to their app since their email notifications are also very delayed  overall the app is just ok but if you get paper checks and dont like going to the bank might be worth banking elsewhere because other banks have apps with much more reliable features,0

ok,1
love it so dependable ,1
decent,1
app works ok and normally would  have decent rating but because unlike all other financial apps i have and use regularly which is a lot this one and only this one except understandably when doing a restore turns off touchid and makes you sign in an reenable itand routinely at that today it wont even let you reenable it because of maintenance  shouldnt have fiddled with my settings not the developerseven apple doesnt get that with things like location services or blue tooth especially right before going into maintenance also i abhor any app that phones home to see if a new version is out and if so disable the use of the app thats disgusting behavior even if its security relatedfor all those who have these issuesand the developers as wellknow that the other banks dont do this bad customer treatment in the name of security im assuming thats why so feel free to try out another bank and their appand remember they all would be happy to have your business theyre all competitive with each otherfor a lot now it doesnt matter who has a closer branch but who has a better app and better customer service bank of most of america not in alaska where family is at so needs qualified for example doesnt do any of said annoyances and their stock is doing well as welltake note chase the propensity for ads is annoying as well especially the method and prevalence even worse is how its on top of the good morningafternoon etc message meaning they are more interested in telling you to go after some service you already said no to many times over than to say the greeting promoting a service is ok but not as an annoyance that causes customers to not enjoy being one so how ironic to do suchalso some other reviews dont seem to know the app does allow viewing balances without signing in on bottom part of left side menu pane there is  my settings gt account preview and theres an option to enable some data to be shown with out logging in there is also in my settings an option to enable touchidthe app has had touchid for a while and lot of reviewers are complaining about the lack of a feature that already is there and has been for a long time,1

the app is ok no real complaints the banks abusive behaviors is a serious problem  i am looking for another bank to move to we have many accounts with chase and some of them also linked  easy to do transfers bill pays monitoring etc the problem is we use a chase cc as an overdraft protection and as soon as there is an overdraft we manage it right away with assist from notifications and all is cool and the bank makes high interest for the unpaid balance which is as it should be  equitable to both sides however starting in august chase is ending a chase cc for covering  overdrafts instead it is forcing its customers to open a savings account with sufficient funds to cover all expected overdrafts this means i have to lock down my cash sufficiently large balance to cover any possible future overdraft or i will be charged large penalties due to payment bounces if not covered and the bank continues to make huge interest  on my savings balancethis is as abusive of a behavior as any bank i know i also bank with bank of america using their cc and have been for a very long time and have never seen such abusive behaviors so i am seriously planning on moving all our accounts to another bank possibly boa if all else is good or some other bank  researching now for a bank with the least abusive behavior they all have it  some less than others most folks dont know about this rule change including my chase branch managerjust a heads up,1

for a bank with over a trillion dollars in assetsor any bank for that matterthis piece of software is absolutely pathetic and unacceptablethe app crashes all the time on my ipod touch in fact if i dont delete and reinstall it it is guaranteed to crash after one successful usewhen it doesnt crash i use it to deposit checks remotely because that is the pathetic state of affairs in this country we use smartphones to deposit paper checks thanks to bank lobbyists for the money services round tableso i just tried depositing a check it took seven tries the first six attempts gave every error imaginable there was a problem with the routing number there was a problem with the account number the internet connection is down it isnt the connection to chases server is temporarily unavailable what i dont have any accounts with chase what at this point it actually did remove all of my accounts from the apps accounts screen so i had to sign out and then in again then both the routing number and the account number are incorrect then it workedare you serious this is state of the art this is what i get for propping up the banks as a taxpayer this is what i get for paying  per wire transfer and other outrageous fees for my corporate accountoh and the peertopeer payment system that the app doesnt even support is a total joke why do i have to manually accept funds if someone is paying me i assure you i want that moneyi would change banks but given that the rest are mostly worse its just enough to make me never want to use chase for anything that i dont absolutely have to if anyone from chase is reading this i want all of my fees refunded,1

i changed banks recently i moved from wells fargo to chase the online experience both the app and the desktop is horrible with chase on the wells fargo app you can search your transactions by name amount or check number you can also view the pdf of your checks you cant do any of that on the chase app if i want to see how much i spent at xyz grocery store in  i can do that using the wells fargo app on my phone or online using my computer nocando with chase its awful if i want to view the pdf of a check that just cleared on my phone i can do that with the wells fargo app but not with chase also many transactions have very long names that get cut off and end in ellipses  with the wells fargo app you can tap on the transaction to see all the detail if youre not sure what it is such as gas stations that have names that dont match their marquis not so with the chase app long ago i had a chase account and i closed it because the app was so substandard it has such low functionality and you can barely do anything with it you also cant tell what your real balance is because it doesnt break out your pending transactions from your actual balance the wells fargo app doesim not affiliated with wells fargo in any way but their app and desktop application are soooooooooo superior that im hoping if i say it enough times chase will get their act together and copy wells i mean the app is truly horrible i am probably going to close my account again just because of how bad the app is i do all of my banking using my phone and i have to have an app that does everything this app is god awful chase programmers please copy wells fargo app and give me an app that actually does what i need it to do,1

ive had highs and lows with my chase app all of them pretty close to the high end i even enjoyed the brief flirtation with touch id as i have a pathological issue remembering passwords but i always have my finger with me i love that you pick out the local sights of the city even though for my town it is really just a weird fountain people pee on or lovely rolling hills that i understand dont actually represent my city as there are no hills but capture the pastoral nature of my state i love itthen i updated my app now each time i sign in it says sorry temporarily unavailable try again in a moment having the same reaction i do when i knock on the door of an occupied restroom i politely step away and busy myself with a quick networking chat darts heck i have even doubled down on my choice to wait and had a juice whilst waiting giving my wait for the occupant of the ladies room a very specific timer rather than the general one i had prior i try to log back in i lean in and rap my knuckles softly against the door and hear the same lilting response sorry temporarily unavailable try again in a moment to which i feel bad as i have clearly been impatient it is only after multiple juices later i am like a sim whose indicator is red and it becomes clear i am likely to wet myself if i do not use the facilities quickly yet each time i try there is the same haunting cheerful lilt i try the handle and find i can open the door and i realize ive been duped a koala stuffed animal with sunglasses on is sitting beside a motion controlled tape recorder whose repetitions of sorry temporarily unavailable try again in a moment have reached a fever pitch as i react emotionally and physically to this torture ive endured that was an untrue story but for real your app keeps saying it is unavailable i use it multiple times daily and now i am lost pleasesend helpasap,1

i can not make multiple same day deposits towards my business credit cardi was told to use another account to make multiple same day deposits towards my business credit cardi want my business transactions to pay on and or towards my chase business debit savings and credit card accountsmoney laundering is the process of transforming the profits of crime and corruption into ostensibly legitimate assets in a number of legal and regulatory systems however the term money laundering has become conflated with other forms of financial and business crime and is sometimes used more generally to include misuse of the financial system involving things such as securities digital currencies credit cards and traditional currency including terrorism financing and evasion of international sanctions most antimoney laundering laws openly conflate money laundering which is concerned with source of funds with terrorism financing which is concerned with destination of funds when regulating the financial systemsome countries define money laundering as obfuscating sources of money either intentionally or by merely using financial systems or services that do not identify or track sources or destinations other countries define money laundering to include money from activity that would have been a crime in that country even if it was legal where the actual conduct occurred there has been some criticism of antimoney laundering laws with some commentators saying that this broad brush of applying money laundering to incidental extraterritorial or simply privacyseeking behaviors is like a financial thoughtcrime in china merchants around  bce would hide their wealth from rulers who would simply take it from them and banish them in addition to hiding it they would move it and invest it in businesses in remote provinces or even outside chinaover the millennia many rulers and states imposed rules that would take wealth from their citizens and this led to the development of offshore banking and tax evasion one of the enduring methods has been the use of parallel banking or informal value transfer systems such as hawala that allowed people to move money out of the country avoiding state scrutinyin the th century the seizing of wealth again became popular when it was seen as an additional crime prevention tool the first time was during the period of prohibition in the united states during the s this saw a new emphasis by the state and law enforcement agencies to track and confiscate money organized crime received a major boost from prohibition and a large source of new funds that were obtained from illegal sales of alcoholthe september th attacks in  which led to the patriot act in the us and similar legislation worldwide led to a new emphasis on money laundering laws to combat terrorism financing the group of seven g nations used the financial action task force on money laundering to put pressure on governments around the world to increase surveillance and monitoring of financial transactions and share this information between countries starting in  governments around the world upgraded money laundering laws and surveillance and monitoring systems of financial transactions anti money laundering regulations have become a much larger burden for financial institutions and enforcement has stepped up significantly during  a number of major banks faced everincreasing fines for breaches of money laundering regulations this included hsbc which was fined  billion in december  and bnp paribas which was fined  billion in july  by the us government many countries introduced or strengthened border controls on the amount of cash that can be carried and introduced central transaction reporting systems where all financial institutions have to report all financial transactions electronically for example in  australia set up the austrac system and required the reporting of all financial transactionsaccording to the united states treasury department money laundering is the process of making illegallygained proceeds ie dirty money appear legal ie clean typically it involves three steps placement layering and integration first the illegitimate funds are furtively introduced into the legitimate financial system then the money is moved around to create confusion sometimes by wiring or transferring through numerous accounts finally it is integrated into the financial system through additional transactions until the dirty money appears clean money laundering can facilitate crimes such as drug trafficking and terrorism and can adversely impact the global economyin its mission to safeguard the financial system from the abuses of financial crime including terrorist financing money laundering and other illicit activity the financial crimes enforcement network fincen acts as the designated administrator of the bank secrecy act bsa the bsa was established in  and has become one of the most important tools in the fight against money laundering since then numerous other laws have enhanced and amended the bsa to provide law enforcement and regulatory agencies with the most effective tools to combat money launderingi do not want to be accused of money laundering financial terrorism tax evasion or securities evasiontake the feedback and forward it for review,1

hi,1
chase listened to amp acted on customer requests to enable users to make deposits by taking a picture of your check i wish the mobile bank of america app had this feature i dont often have a check to deposit but now when i do i dont have to waste time amp gas to physically deposit the check at the bank kudos to chase,1
works great,1
moving over from b of a and this app seems better i have two accounts business amp personal it would be nice if chase app could remember multiple user ids,1
i was so excited when they added quick deposit for the ipod touch after figuring out the right lighting and angle i was able to deposit my first check then i hit a wall when i tried a check that was over  sadly chase limits you to  every day my dream of never having to visit the bank or atm to deposit a check was dashed due to this arbitrary limit,1
used to work perfectly but ever since the latest update i cant deposit through my iphone never had a problem before update thanks,1
i love using this app but the most recent update had made the app inaccessible can you please fix it so i can use the app again i usually check chase mobile every day thanks,1
i tried  times to take a picture of a check for quick deposit  a chase check  and it still didnt work great idea in theory lousy in reality,1
cant cancelstop a payment,1
thank you for finally making the deposit feature available for ipod touch you just saved me a trip to the bank ,1
works great,1
love it best app to keep track of you  ,1
first of all great app  its wonderful being able to handle my finances while in the go  the only bug ive encountered is that red alert badges appear on the apps icon for no reason whatsoever i even disabled all alerts on my account and these badges still appear  also for genuine badge alerts its kind of tedious to check every single account to see which one the alert was for maybe they could all be placed under a new alerts tab or something  other than that excellent job,1
now that i can deposit from my ipod touch this is pretty much the perfect free app kudos to chase for listening to their customers needs,1
wish i could see withdraws with more detail other than that i like the app,1
mobile check deposits is so amazing chase is really the best hands down,1
very useful for incredibly quick payments and balancetransaction checking updated to  stars when i saw they added ipod touch deposit capabilities but dropped back to  stars cause i cant get the thing to work picture isnt clear enough  over and over,1
this app is great i use it all the time i can even deposit checks with it when i need to its lovely thank you chase,1
awesome app helps prevent overdrafts can do funds transfers can pay bills check when a bill was last paid amp how much was paid easy to use,1
i dont need to go to the bank anymore thsnks to chase  thanks for bringing the future of mobile banking  best experience with chase  thank you ,1
love it,1
muy util para esos que le gusta cuidar sus finanzas esto es lo mejor,1
lol,1
just perfect,1
i like it,1
comoberificar que funsione comomuestra la aplicacin gracias,1
trate d actualizar mi app tengo  diaz esparando solo dise waiting alguien me puede ayudar no me deja hacer como lo borro,1
view details on transaction update asap,1
love quick deposit,1
mobile deposits,1
great app but the check deposit doesnt work please fix it asap,1
this app was suppose to update on my  days ago and its still not there,1
everything about this app is really quite great other than the deposit feature which was disappointing the image of the check gets cut in half whenever you take it which means a ton of trial and error until you blindly get a decent one if its not too blurry that is im keeping the app for all the other features though,1
the deposit feature isnt working properly on my ipod touchthe picture keeps getting cut in half for some reason this has nothing to do with the megapixel issue as blurriness isnt the problem chase or apple can easily fix this and hopefully soon,1
every couple months it tells me it doesnt recognize my phone and to remedy it they send a text message which i have to pay for and enter a code to be able to access my account im not using a different or new phone so it baffles me why they do this,1
great app does all the basic stuff like being able to check available balance and recent transactions can pay cr card thru this app love that i can deposit checks via phone,1
i love using this app i use the app much more than i use the website i can check my balances at any time transfer money between accounts and pay my credit card i dont use it to pay other bills so i cant say anything about that feature i also use it on an older ipod touch model so i dont have a camera and in turn dont even have the option to deposit with a pic i dont think it lets me see pics of checks when someone else cashes them like i can on the website i would like to be able to do that with the app overall i would recommend the app,1
i have an iphone  and the check deposit button isnt even showing up its not that its grayed out or not accepting the picturesits just not there i deleted and reinstalled the app to no avail fix it chase,1
pnc has no monthly fees,1
i love this app and use it more often than the actual website  let alone atms or the banks depositing checks via photo is hands down the most useful application i have in any app warning turn push notifications off my phone would randomly send me notifications with my actual account balance noted in the text not great if other people are around your phone,1
very convenient to use,1
ive never had any problems with this app nice interface make deposits by picsgreat only wish is being able to manage alerts from the app rather than safari other wise most reliable finance app i have ,1
love the photo quick deposit feature works great,1
this would get a far better review except the deposit feature is terrible you need to take a minimum of  photos to get the pic accepted i finally have given up and drive to the bank,1
i was thrilled to see this app with check deposit was useable with the new ipod touch howeverthe deposit feature does not work the camera only takes half a picture it is not recognizable and therefore will not deposit please fix this feature is one of the reasons i wanted the new ipod with camera this app needs a serious update for ipod touch users,1
wow this saves gas and time i deposit checks from where ever i want thanks,1
the photo deposit never works only good for checking my balance,1
it use to work when i did the upgrade it crashes why,1
i have the new iphone and got this app the first time i long in it was great  after that it tells me that my account is unavailable right now to try again later i have been trying for two week and i get the same message this has a lot of bugs i have to think that it also may not be safe i have account info on here if they have problems with long in they may have problem with safety,1
decent app overall but the check deposit feature has never worked for me,1
which was all i wanted it for maybe if i had a tripod to hold the phone still enough  couldnt get an image clear enough for them to take it,1
the bank app works fine but the one part that would be great does not work the deposit part can never accept the photo no matter how hard i try what it need is a scanner,1
so convenient to use and very crisp clear navigation flow taking banking to next level i love online check deposit,0
quick deposit has changed my life please consider allowing checks up to  and up to  for the month thanks,1
needs to allow chek depositing from ipod touch g,1
love the app chase but the quick deposit really needs an update i have tried and tried but it won accept the picture o the checki used perfect lighting and the check was written clearly and picture as perfect as it cab be and still rejected my checkplz fix this problem as soon as possible i am very excited to use this feature plz fix ,1
awesome app except the deposit does not work on the ipod touch g  this is a pretty big issue for many people who either dont have time or live out in the country where a chase might be far away   stars because of this  if it doesnt work with the camera then just disable the deposit feature and save people the false hope,1
i love this app its so easy to do everything i need to including paying my bills and depositing my checks i dont have any issues with depositing typed checks but i dont deposit hand written ones so i dont know how good it is for that one issue i do have is that there is a limit to how much you can deposit online i dont like that,1
needs to allow check deposit from ipod touch ,1
this app is very useful it helps deal with the hassle of commuting to the bankamphaving to wait in line to deposit a check it saves gas to app works perfectly fine you wont regret it,1
when log in name is remembered the name should be marked as  while showing only the first or last  letters,1
this app lets me know when my card is being used and lets me post payments and review my rewards and stay in touch with my finances it would be nice to be able to see your last statement though maybe for the next update,1
really needs pending charges added to the app by charge broken out if amex can do why cant chase,1
thank you for making this app  i would like to request seeing bill activity for just pendind payments and sorted by date  beside this one issue the app is perfectthanks chase,1
great app,1
 multiple id stored logins  stop showing the message notices when there are none  please have a way to display full details of transactions,1
this app is the best  i love that i can pay someone through my bill pay and through quick pay option on the go  the deposit option for the app is excellent for people on the go and dont have to worry about making another stop,1
separate identification code process is a horrendous pain  took multiple tries and entries to succeed and the wording on the txt msg is terribly unclear kudos for adding push alerts rewards multitasking  buttons and fields are small,1
trying to deposit checks is my main app but it is always a hassle i enter all the amount info take two pics as directed then click enter and wait and wait and wait the system says it cant read the pics retake the pics with more light and wait again and then get the same response do it again with more light wait wait again then i finally get a request to enter routing and acct numbers finally after i do the deposit is finally accepted   for me it would be much nicer to do an eitheror after the first request to reenter the info,1
got the app thinking it would work with the i touch but it doesnt on the app description it says check deposit is only available on i phone bummer other than that i can check balances etc just disappointed the check thing doesnt work but the app works well,1
this is great because i just turn on my ipod and check my account and i dont have to waste my time to wait my computer start oncool but this needs a updatecuz every time that  i have an overdraw dont show me the  and this is so confuse fix it,1
depositing a check is the easiest thing of life,1
cant see acct s or payment addresses for mortgage or cc payments ok if all activities are auto pay,1
i have a chase bank account but it doesnt even show up when i log in no idea what the problem is but not worth the trouble to find out why,1
best app in the industry for the best bank in the industry wouldnt expect anything less,1
i freaking love it you can do everything from depositing a check to cash transfers its awesome i use it on a daily basis you can also pay your bills from the app you get reminders of how much is in your account its great every chase banker should definitely have this,1
quick deposits doesnt work with an ipod touch g every picture i tried to take gets cropped in half resulting in a picture of half a check if i could i would have rated this no stars,1
it keeps crashing crap app,1
crashes every time i try to take a deposit picture,1
everything is good but the taking photo of the check as deposit isnt in my options in the app i have an iphone  what would be the problem,1
i love this app and use it every day however there are a few features that would make it perfect first please allow us to add a payee from the app second the  limit on deposits makes it almost useless also the deposit feature could use some improvements,1
i love having all my accounts at my fingers at all times the ability to deposit checks from my iphone is huge my only complaint is that it wont recognize all checks i try to deposit  personal checks with complex designs seems to obscure the ability for the app to read relevant check info and it doesnt seem to like corporate checks with long and small check numbers a small complaint really i use this app often,1
in a world where many people bank after  pm youd think you could use your personal bank app then seems like every time i need to check my balance or check a purchase i get were temporarily unable to connect to chase please try again later thanks for your patience  tired of seeing this please update on a good day this is an amazing app totally recommend to any chase user iphone  amp gs user everything is up to date on all devices,1
i was very excited to use this app when i got my gs but soon found out that it takes  days for payroll checks to become available not only does this completely defeat the purpose for me but because i deposited my check new years eve it wont become available until monday  days later this app is great if you want to look at unusable balance on the fly i really thought this would work like my atm,1
in terms of checking your balance or paying bills online thus app is useful but the online deposit feature doesnt work no matter how bright the lighting or crisp the penmanship it tells me the check is unable to be read and to deposit it at a branch arg,1
this app is so cool i can deposit my checks right from my iphone  no need driving to the branches unless i need quick cash from the atm absolutely  stars for those of you who are unable to deposit with itouch its probably your camera does not take hd pictures i made more than  check deposits in the last month and they all went through,1
unless with the ipod touch gits always telling me its not able to read the checki can only check my balance,1
works great,1
app works great no problems with the iphone ,1
right now my family is without a computer so we only use the application it would be nice to add bills from my phone instead of having to go to the library to do it and on the mobile site they need a link at the bottom of the page that days full site live chat from the app would be awesome to,1
no probs,1
works great,1
never crashes and its so easy to use very handy for all banking needs,1
thank you,1
full access to web features love the check deposit feature,1
doesnt send notifications at the correct day or time theyre so sporadic make sure they are sent at the correct time,1
ill give  stars when they let me make deposits with my ipod touch th generation,1
be careful about using this app and all mobile banking apps they all lack in security just today someone made a fake atm card using my info and withdrew over  from an atm also treated themselves to carls jr just use these apps with extreme caution,1
this is the best bank app out there it looks applelike and clearly chase focuses a lot of attention on the app since it is updates often functionally it does everything i need  transfers deposits bill pay truly awesome,1
the only thing this app does well is make me angry its bad enough that the stupid noenvelope chase atms wont accept some of my checks but now i have an app that is total garbage every time i try to do a deposit the stupid blue box messes up and only gets half of the image then no matter how clear the image is it gets rejected for being too blurry next step drive to crappy atm that wont take my checks then remove my money and close the account stupid bank stupid app,1
now that the i touch can make deposits i  am increasing my rating to  stars  stats will be deserved once the monthly deposit limit is increased from k to something more realistic maybe k per month would better,1
it keeps saying it cannot connect to chase all the time when is it ever going to connect,1
update screwed the app,1
i have tried many different checks and i have never gotten this function to work there is always something wrong it seems like there is a different problem every time the update did not help,1
very useful the check deposit feature never works for me though otherwise its great if not for the check deposit issue id give it  stars,1
i have an account with pnc and chase works much better sometimes the check deposit from my iphone doesnt work but most of the time it does great app thanks chase,1
theyre everywhere amp who else can deposit a check by taking a picture of it,1
good app nice interface i got this app before the recent update mainly to see if i could make deposits with my ipod touchs camera even though chase stated it did not support ipod touchwhen taking photos of my checks within the blue box the app would cut half of the image i was able to trick it by positioning the camera farther back amp i was able to make the depositseven though it wasnt supportedwith the new update im finally able to fit the check within its parameters amp it looks clearer than before but unfortunately it wont allow me to make any deposits written or printed checks welllit or notthe official ipod touch update made it worse now than when it wasnt supportedim curious to know if anyone actually tested it before its launch,1
this was a great app but since the update i cannot log in,1
chase mobile app easily stands tall compared to other mobile banking apps easily a five star,1
when i first got this app it worked like the web site but now i cant get into it somebody fix please i need to monitor my acct at all times who wants to carry a laptop every where all in all a good app for what its worth,1
doesnt work,1
this app is very well put together it has all the functionality of the website and is organized intuitively,1
this is the optimus prime of all mobile banking apps all the others are just wannabots,1
credit card allows you to pay but does not show balance last statement so you can pay the balance in full minimum only not convenient to pay on account unless you only pay minimum needs more summaries of balances and previous payments,1
i really like the quick deposit the greatest banking app ever ever,1
this app is handy to check balances and transfer funds however i have zero luck depositing checks it could be my iphone camera because the image is always considered blurry and wont be accepted its frustrating,1
ive used this with my gs amp now my iphone  and it only works about  of the time in other words useless,1
well done app,1
i use it daily excellent way to keep up with your funds while on the go billpay allows for flawless mobile use to pay bills i think its easier than using their website,1
i tried helping my mother with the deposit feature it didnt work at all and it kept closing and logging me out its annoying and this needs to be fixed,1
it is convenient to have access to thus information on my iphone i was so excited about the quick deposit however it will not work with business checks that have smaller print which is what i have i have taken about  pictures with no luck big letdown,1
i use all functions on this app check account balance bill pay check deposit money transfersthe app works perfectly and is extremely convenient to do any of your banking on the go,1
just downloaded the app and used it a few times  the app does what i need without problems except that that quick deposit did not work due to the low resolution camera on the ipod touch,1
i downloaded  banking applications today and this is the only one that i havent been able to get started  it crashes every time i try to input my login id  it doesnt happen with the iphone apps from wells fargo citibank or bofa  their website is equally painful to load,1
this app is pretty good lets you see your account transfer money pay bills even see my rewards which i love but the check deposit is so frustrating it shouldnt be even a feature ive gotten multiple errors from check blurry to my account not excepting deposit wtf i just end up pissed off at the world after trying then angrily end up going to the bank anyway,1
this app didnt allow me to log in and wouldnt let me click anything because the same alert kept coming up every time i exited,1
best bank and best bank app ive never had a problem with it or the quick deposit feature its so easy to use i love being able to pay bills with ease and transferring between accounts plus the account alerts are super helpful letting me know if my balance goes low so i can make a quick transfer,1
i never have antisocial using this app and its very helpful ,1
i just had to go out of my way to say that i am thoroughly impressed with this app totally helps me keep track of my accounts and i absolutely love the push notifications,1
still get the stupid account cannot be accessed during this time try again later error every time i click on my balance to see all previous transactions fix it until then one star thats all,1
this app will not allow you to make any deposits if you ever have overdrawn your account even years backthis is the small print they dont advertise for i was told today customers with bad standing will not be able to deposit since they are a risk for chase bankone wonders why giving them money would ever be any risk for them ,1
handy for checking balance but i have a student account and i dont even have a button for deposits wft ,1
i like being able to access my accounts on my iphone  i have apps for usaa paypal and chase  the only thing that is annoying about this app is the auto logout  my other accounts just tell me i was logged out and then go to the login screen automatically  i have to press two ok buttons on this app if i forget to logout which is most of the time  would be nice to fix this because i dont think anyone would assume that they would stay logged in after closing the app,1
why is it that whenever i use this app i have to get a security code txt message bc it does not recognize this device this happens every time if you do put in the security txt the next time you want to use your computer to check your account you need to do a security code for it chase only remembers  device i hate this,1
chase really did their homework when developing this app  i cant think of anything i want to do that it doesnt do this app is quick to log onto easy to navigate through amp gives me  access to my banking  so many times ive caught vendors trying to put through extra charges amp have been able to stop them because i saw it in real time  excellent job chase  get this appit will change your life,1
i used the app to deposit two checks one did not go thru the other did but not before the app gave me error long story short i ended up depositing the check again at an atm big mistake chase got the money for the check but did not give me a cent rather it charged me a check return fee of  almost two weeks into it most everyone i spoke with at chase could not care less about my situation and did not help me so if u deposit verify regardless of what it says i give it an f,1
this app is great very well put together guys  one thing that others have that will make this one perfect is a quick digit login to the app the app should remember the online log in password  a quick digit log in to the app would avoid me typing the usual long password required for online access by chase  something like a visit to the atm,1
very good,1
a lot of people have mentioned that there is a maximum limit for  per day however there is also a lower limit for the check which is  i got an interest check for my deposit and its only  and i cant deposit it in app because its too little the app asks me to deposit it in the branch whos gonna drive  minutes just to deposit a  check and seriously chase really would rather waste man power at their branch than taking the check online its just plain stupid,1
this is a really helpful app for business and personal i just would like to increase the amount of deposits it would help lots,1
raise the deposit limitexcellent app,1
i have been using this app for a while and just used the remote deposit function snap a picture of the check with the iphone and it couldnt have been easier to make a deposit check cleared very quickly and i saved myself some gas and a trip to the bank,1
in comparison to the usaa deposit app this is terrible usaa works everytime in any kind of light on this app one check would never deposit and the second did after several tries finally by resubmitting without even retaking the picture these were both business checks taken in both sunlight and in bright indoor light it needs work,1
excellent appgot almost everything that website offers great app to manage ur accts with chase,1
this app is easy to use and much better than the ipad version,1
great app saves me a trip to bank,1
why even have an app if it doesnt work  of the time  chase you are only upsetting your customers by having a horrible app  wish i could rate this zero stars,1
alerts always saying false,1
saturday i deposited  checks without any problems sunday i tried depositing another check and it says were sorry try again later today is monday and i am getting the same message it would be nice if this app worked like it does on the commercial,1
this app is not as fully featured as my other banks app but it works as advertised and is easy to use,1
quick deposit does not work,1
best part of the app is the quick deposit feature bank of america doesnt have this and its so convenient however quick deposit doesnt seem to work anymore for several days it has been saying were sorry try again later but later it still isnt working   if it worked id give the app  stars im glad to have the quick pay feature as part of the app now also very convenient and ive had no problem with it,1
this is an amazing app i love chase bank even if quick deposit doesnt work i have never had any problems i could just go to an atm with my cash check and make deposit there so convenient,1
so far not impressedsorry try again laternow picture not clear enough very frustrated what a crock of crap,1
i got this app mostly to be able to deposit checks from my iphone my pictures were clear and you could read every word letter and number perfectly yet it still said that the image was not clear enough for the check to be deposited lame tried more than once and at different times of the day short of a perfectly contrived photo studio with the intent on doing nothing else but take photos of checks with it i dont know what else to tryit is nice to have account access at my finger tips so i gave the app a  star for the effort cool if it worked for you but it legit didnt work for me,1
have been trying to use depositing all daywont work in perfect lighting  angle,1
i love the ease in accessing my account to review activity and especially in making payments i would really like the app more if i could sign up for the quarterly rewards via the app instead of going online,1
why doesnt the deposit part even show up on my app this is frustrating because it was the only reason i wanted the app,1
it was ok before but since i updated it it doesnt work anymore i was unable to deposit my check very frustrating i tried many times but failed   star for now unless gets better,1
great app  but it needs improvement example i would like to see more detail on checks not just the check number i want to see who i made it out to  people forget and not all the time im behind the computer to see with more detail,1
also had a problem with depositing checks this week is there a fix in order also would like to see a feature showing total balance through all accounts overall though great app very easy to use thanks,1
great app love the ease of checking my account and making transfers would be nice to be able to search for certain transactions would love to see a calculator built in to this app,1
i love being able to deposit checks on the go,1
unless you are in direct sunlight the deposit feature almost never works,1
use iphone to take pic for deposits inside home at night needed to deposit  checks ranging from  to  need to take pics of front and back of check and fill in amount and wait for verification and confirmation first pic was not accepted but retook in brighter light and all the rest were accepted without problem i submitted using wireless network at home and each submittal took about  seconds before receiving confirmation saves a trip to the bank though the limit for deposits is  if you need to pay a bill it works well but did not find a way to add a payee its a worthwhile app to have in my opinion as i can now pays bills from my iphone,1
agree with everyone  a day is lame  chase needs to fix,1
plz make it so we can redeem our points right from the app instead of going to the bank or to thier website thank you,1
one of the reasons i switched banks was to use the picture feature it worked the first  times them never again no one seems to be able to help me and i am extremely unhappy and frustrated by this my phone is the iphone  my ap is up to date,1
this mostly useless app constantly forces me to get a confirmation email even after putting in my username and password in most cases it would be quicker to drive to an atm total crap,1
i would give this app at least  more stars if chase removed the done button you have to click after entering your password you shouldnt have to click two buttons at this point to log in,1
on the road in a big truck it is hard to fit into the drive thru in order to deposit checks from my customers just opened an account wchase and now i dont have to greatest app i own,1
using the deposit feature doesnt always work it took the incorrect information off a check and then a week later after i had voided the check it gets taken out of my account wont trust it again,1
while the deposit function is hip and all it doesnt work well and it doesnt really save time very slowpush notification doesnt work it would have the number on the icon when i login to the app the number disappears i wont know what notifications i got,1
it is a good app for doing transfers and checking balances the check deposit does not always work cant trust it i own a small business it would be nice to accept credit cards thru the same app add that and you would have a great app also you need to allow points to be redeemed thru the app,1
i used to love this app but for an very long time it says unable to communicate with chase when i want to see my transaction history it obviously has communicated already since it does give me my balance they really need to fix this glitch sooner vs later,1
cant trasnfer money from savings to checking says im uneligable to transfer this app always has some sort of problem its very annoying,1
this feature is nearly impossible to use correctly it never maps to your location correctly and therefore throws off results i realize this is more an atampt issue but the app could easily give you the option to type in your current address and use that info so frustratingthe deposit feature though cool can take just as much time getting everything right as it would be to walk to the bank and manually deposit it the only good feature of the app is readily and easily seeing your amount in accounts but for me this is only half the reason i use the app,1
when trying to find a branch it tells you where they are but you cant use your smart phone to get directions you cant use your smart phone to copy amp paste the address in to google directionswhen looking for a contact number you get a automated line with no option to talk to any one with out having your  digit account number then when you find a location it is not even close to where you are why use s smart phone app that asked to use your location if it isnt going to really use it this app needs some serious work done to it,1
i like how they added the manual entry on the check deposit for my touch the images used to be too blurry to deposit now i can deposit on my touch and i never have to go to a branch or atm for deposits again,1
empty promises and lousy service i want my washington mutual back this check scan is a joke  minutes trying to get it to work and to no avail if i were getting paid by the hour the deposit i was trying to make is less than what i would have earned thanks for nothing chase with this app i thought just maybe you might be redeeming yourself with charging me  a month to be banking with youwrong and to think washington mutual had  interest on their checking before these clowns took over,1
i cant even get it to send me a pin to confirm my iphone please fix,1
my fav feature is the automatic check deposit loves it ,1
good but doesnt connect to the ultimate rewards points website would be nice,1
i rarely review apps so you have to know theres a reason why im here this app is terrible it asks me every time i open it for a new identification code saying that it cant recognize my device so it needs that confirmation again ive never changed devices since ive downloaded the app then it will tell me my identification code is wrong because sometimes it even texts me two instead of one and neither work then once you finally get into the app if i hit my account summary it never loads also it claims to send push notifications if you set that your account drops below a certain number  doesnt do that either and can you imagine ive never even used the mobile deposit before which is what everyone is complaining about just dont bother,0
when i was trying to make mobile check deposit it makes the entire application crashing down and going to home screen of iphone i dont know while am watching my transactions it is closing the whole application,0
id like to be able to edit and add payees with the app but it works well otherwise,1
i absolutely love the instant deposit its so convenient but sometimes it cant connect to chase but thats okay cause i found you just need to turn onampoff your iphone and the flash on the iphone  makes it better,1
i made a  deposit in my account on feb st using the iphone app  days after chase reversed this deposit claiming i deposited twice not true my account statement only shows one deposit since then my  have been on limbo i have been to the chase branch twice called their call center  times and  days after and they still cant figure out where they messed up my advice do not use the online deposit service of chase its unreliable and chase is not prepared to handle online deposits,1
would love this app if i could,1
basic functions such as balance transfers and billpay work fine but anyone who has tried to make a deposit using the camera feature will agree that it is tedious at best  it always takes at least  shots of both sides of the check to work and most times i simply give up  very much needs work,1
the app was great until the update now i cant deposit checks redeem itself guys i will be monitoring to see if any changes have been made what happened,1
its good to check my balance but hate that i cant change alerts right from the app but hate even more that it sends me the same fing alert every day to tell me the balance is over the amount specified annoying,1
i tried  times but some how a very good working app now starts crashing when i am trying to deposit the check the app crashes as soon as i start taking a picture please fix this this app has reduced my bank visits,1
it has worked great since the last update but now says temporarily unable to connect  of the time and is now useless needs to be updated,1
love it and use it multiple times a day,1
used to work all the time every time but since the last update it seems tobe having trouble connecting to the site and for people on the go which is everyone thats a problem please please make sure the update you give is doing its job bc i never had a problem before your update,1
the biggest problem on my i phone i have to always get an identification code before i use it the other i could not see what i had left in credit used to not have these problems so for now to does me no good,1
check deposit does not work,1
ok if all you want to do is check your balance but dont try to make a deposit unless you like pulling your hair out  nice when it works but usually takes four tries and sometimes doesnt ever work very frustrating why any company would put out software that is so unreliable is beyond me,1
as others have said the depositing of checks is nearly impossible keeps saying try again later fix the darn thing already,1
doesnt allow you to deposit enough money via check,1
dont know why others cant quick deposit but i can best banking app iv come across i deposit checks check my balance and pay bills no problems,1
with all the money chase makes they should be able to hire someone to make a better app needs a rebuild,1
when it puts the address into google maps it just takes u to a street no the location,1
i tried to pay my bill using this app  got an error message so i tried again   days later i had a  fee on my card for a failed payment  i had to fight an haggle with a representative then manager to get it fixed  never again,1
ive not had the problems that others are mentioning the app has worked great for me i dont bother keeping a check book anymore this is just too convenient the only trouble ive had with depositing checks is when they are handwritten the app cannot read them very well but as i very rarely have them its not an issue for me my one complaint having to type my password in each and every time i understand the security reasons behind it but it gets old,1
i love this app i can check my balance view transaction history transfer money pay bills send my sister money with quick pay and its all free i have never deposited a check i have direct deposit but i cant wait to try that too has never crashed and i think its super easy to use,1
i downloaded the chase mobile app specifically to avoid having to go to a chase atm  times a week to make deposits i have an iphone g which i know the camera doesnt take very clear pictures to begin with and so of course when id take a photo of a check to deposit id get an immediate too blurry message so what am i supposed to do maybe its other features work well but im agorophobic to begin with i dont like going out if i dont have to and this feature would have helped ease my stress of doing so a lot,1
i didnt no mobile banking could be so great up and running in minutes,1
this app is a convenient way to doublecheck your balance and its a hell of a lot easier than using the internet on your computer for the same purpose,1
disconcerting when a bank app frequently crashes  ,1
k limit on deposit  well at least you can check your balance,1
but for some reason photo deposit has stopped working on my iphone gs it always says the photo isnt clear,1
i use it all the time,1
please make routing number editable in deposit check option once picture of check is taken the routing field is entered automatically with account number and account number entered with check number overall unable to deposit the check will give  star once fixed otherwise great app,0
has been working good for me though a manual refresh button would be nice for the find atmbranch feature it seems to have trouble autoupdating my current location,0
you cant deposit a check bigger than  and no more than  in  months so if you dont have direct deposit i feel sorry for you ,1
its an okay overall app my only criticism so far is that its hard to figure out what the notification are for example there is a little flag on the chase app icon right now indicating a notification pending i have push notifications on of course unfortunately despite looking many times i cant seem to find in the app where the notification messages are,1
at the bottom theres no deposit button where its suppose to be,1
i can log on successfully about  of the time this has to be one of the least reliable banking appsthanks for my patience my patience is about up,1
what is the point of  monthly limit who that can afford an iphone has checks that small,1
paying my bills never works on this app its always temporarily not working,1
probably the best app that ive used,1
deposit part of app is crap never works pic never clear amount never matches app is bs,1
sindee must have mental problems because i deposit my check only by my phone this app is great i love my ,1
this application does not let me view my account activity it gives me a statement saying it is temporarily not able to shoe account activity i have reported this problem but it continues it used to work fine and then it stopped,1
ive had this since last year and i use it daily and some days i use more than once i also use it to deposit checks i get monthly that arent ach deposits and i have never had a problem with this app so far it has been a lifesaver for me so i cant understand why alot of people are having problems all i know is that to me this app is gold,1
this was good but caused us to overdraw on our joint account we both have separate accounts out of chase and barely use this one but this time we used it it said we had we didnt horrible with updating balances and things purchased pass this app up,0
this app is so useful i probably use it more than i use atms you can do everything its fast and has a great ui,1
works just fine but the ultimate reward points are not correct on the app you should be able to view check images and search by check number,1
i use this app constantly daily to manage my finances never fails,1
this is a great app yesterday chase took away my rewards point program  but this app is a winner,1
love this app simple and effective especially like the ability to deposit checks just by snapping a picturewould be cool if we could printissue checks from it too,1
recent update has made some features paying bills transfers + several others unstable constant error messages please fix or this great app will be completely useless and a waste of space on my phone,1
before there was a quick deposit but after the tab on the bottom didnt have quick deposit,1
i love this app and it is the only reason i still hold one bank account with chase  being able to deposit checks over the phone is a huge time saver for me also money transfers are quick and easy to do  that being said chase is a terrible greedy bank that will nickel and dime you with fees and charges until you give up and move to a local bank that really cares for its community and customers  but im only reviewing the app not the god awful bank itself,1
i love this app in fact new to the bank because of this app used to be with us bank since  hope chase as a bank doesnt give me any aches this app makes managing my financial life  times better especially love how easy it is to pay all my bills and deposit checks with only a few clicks i do wish the monthly deposit limit was raised and wished you could view a check image once deposited both yours or anothers to see what check it is and for what nevertheless spectacular app,1
great app for viewing balances transactions etc but the main feature that made me download the app doesnt work  quick deposit ive tried numerous times to make deposits on both a wifi and g connection to no avail ill be pleased with this app once they fix this feature but until then im stuck with depositing checks at the atm upgrade please,1
wish it would list available balance,1
i can get my balance via text message without taking up space as an app nothing else works in it woulda been nice,1
i love chase app is easy and does wherever you need to but now they got some nasty feet of minimum balance of  is like come on chase the economy is mess up as it is who that hell will keep  as a minimum balance i agree that we have to paid for checks but not the minimum balance is way to hightso now i have to go some where else to bad you was the best till now,1
being able to pay others via an email is greathowever i can not use my to do feature in this appsure would make it a lot better how about a fix guys,1
took photos  times  both front amp back  of check  amp each time the amount was not recognized the amount was completely legible on every photo if you only want to check your balance it works fine,1
this is by far the most robust banking app i have ever used if you have accounts with chase this is a must have app,0
please add feature to view scheduled payment and billing history for cc accounts,1
this works great for me for those individuals who are having trouble depositing checks with this application first you need to make sure the handwriting is legible and the signature those not cover the checks account or routing number this makes a big difference  so far i am very pleased with this app,1
so easy to use simple amp organized userinterface all features and banking tools works perfectly great job chase,1
actually works and feels like a real app  rather than a hastily cobbled together app that feels like a basic web interface good,1
offline for two days useless,1
i am facing temporary delays for a long time now,1
i love that i can pay my bills see my account balance at anytime and such detail i think chase should increase the direct deposit amount greater than  and i do have to go online to add a payee but once that is done i can pay the bill anytime i would like for chase to give me the option to ad the payee via iphone other than that its great and i use it daily,1
quickdeposit would be a great feature if it worked  most deposits fail and ask for a clearer photo  how about some human intervention after the second failed attempt,1
its a great app but the quick check deposit never works for me after take the front and back picture the app crashes or freezes im running ios  please fix that overall is an amazing app,1
i am using  and the only account i have with chase is my mortgage i can see recent info with no problem but when i try to view the history the app crashes please fix this issue,1
i like the app it lets me see all the transactions on my account the problem i have is once i set up a payment i cant see it i had to go to the website to see that i had payment pending i almost paid my bill twice i know the app is free but please fix thanks,1
live it but why can i access everything and not my messages from this app i can acres email and when i click the the link why wont it let me use the regular web browser on my mobile device so i  can read my email,1
couldnt be happier,1
the quick deposit work great i just love it,1
the app is great but the new changes chase recently implemented are ridiculous so i recently closed all of my accounts with them,0
thank you finally i can see my pending transactions by the time i drove home perfect app now,1
i love this app its easy to navigate and transfers are quick and simple,1
nice clean app good job for a bank that wastes money on too many branches,1
no matter how clear the image for the quick deposit looks to me it always comes back as unclear,1
cool app but i tried the deposit via the app feature it accepted the two checks i deposited then rejected them weeks later and charged me  each and no one can tell me why think im happy about that plus who the hell knows where the checks are now total disaster,0
while the majority of this app is usable dont even bother with the deposit feature i followed all the instructions and still had to take pictures of the check over and over again before it magically accepted my deposit james cameron didnt put so much effort into avitar as you have to do to deposit a check get the lighting perfect hold the phone totally still throw salt over your right shoulder pray to the bank gods to accept your offering once all that is done wait  seconds for it to think get it rejected repeat ive never had a check taken any sooner than the th try dont bother,1
love this app check deposit is awesome but wish you all would make a reward points app that lets u spend ur points,1
best app and bank ever a must have if you have chase,1
this app works pretty good but needs to be updated to include all available services found on regular site ie transfers to external accounts being able to see more transactions etc use this to keep life simple but when you really need a feature for an emergency it may not have it available then you either go to a branch or go to a pc for the full online app,1
have used it for both credit card and checking accounts,1
does anybody else not have a deposit button on the app for verizon iphone,1
very very useful app developers please find a better way to review push alerts in the application going through each account to find a single alert is a waste of time,1
simple and takes care of most tasks youd need anything more you can just do it on a regular computer ,1
its simple and does the job needs to improve depositing checks through the iphone  doesnt accept checks  of the time  even though everything is done correctly,1
great app for quick transactions i use this to pay my car payment would recommend to anyone looking for easy banking experience,1
im a chase customer and i use this app all the time i havent had to visit a branch in  months,0
if another user logs into the app i continue to receive their alerts after theyve logged off and i login with my account i am deleting the app in hope that it will clear this account security problem,0
i think people need to learn how to take pictures i have not had one problem with quick depositsimple app easy to use can pay bills on the go awesomepeople complaining about chase as a bank you get what you pay for if you just want a bank to take your money go somewhere else if you want a bank always improving technology and services chase is  go get the app for your credit union and try making a deposit with your phone chances are they dont have an app,1
i use this all the time everywhere i go,1
i love to be able to pull up my account anywhere an view my balance and recent transactions very easy to use keep it up guys,1

nice application giving you many things to do if your a chase customer the only complaint is that in order to varify you have to logout and check your email and write down a long code then open the app again and loving again and type the code in after that the app really shines as a great tool for chase customers,1
i entered in my info and then i had to verify my account and had the activation code texted to me and it wouldnt work then i had another sent to me and it wouldnt work and i know i entered everything in correctly an now i am locked out of my online banking until i go into a store to unlock it i think this is a scam by a third party trying to steal moneyi cant wait to see my account drained,1
this application seems like it would have a ton of potential but unfortunately it does not work  i needed to get an actuvation code to use the new device to log in which i have done on computers before  unfortunately all of the activation codes did not work  now my account was locked and a half hour later with customer service the app still does not work  the customer service does not even seem aware that the app exists  if they fix this it will be a four to five star app but right now one star is generous,1
i didnt run into the activation issues a few others reported i had the activation code sent via text which let me copy it down without exiting the app all of the online features i regularly use are included in a straightforward interface the ability to add payees would be a nice addition but im overall very pleased i like that chase recognized the importance of applications like this,1
this app works great i did have a little problem with the actviation code but i asked for it to be sent again and it worked with out a problem,1
great can now pay my bills anywhere very convenient to monitor my acct very secure with the activation code i love the look and finding branches is easy a must app for anyone who banks with chase,1
seriously  this is as dumb as the stupid bank of america app that links you to their mobile browser based app  instead of releasing this stupid shell why dont you just fix the mshift integration so that we can use the native mobile banking application  ive been calling chase support for weeks since chase was added as an option to mobile banking and its still not working  if you were only going to support a web based app then why not just add the code to make a custom home icon link when someone bookmarks wwwchasemobi,1
i enter my username and password and it tells me that i am using an untrusted device and need to fetch a code from my email and enter it into the app try doing this without a pen and paper or pc handyyou go to your email look at the code go back to chaseapp and enter your credentials again at which point you will have forgotten whatever portion of the random code you could rememberso you either need your email on a pc screen or a pen and paper to take down the code i want to thank chase for making a great little app if you could just find a workaround to the device confirmation it would be ideal atm locator is a killer appnow whos arm do we have to twist at apple to get copy and paste on this darn phone,1
this app does exactly what its supposed to do simple as that plus its free who gives a damn what it looks like if you wanna be entertained then go download crash bandicoot or something if you bank with chase then this apps a must have why not,1
i think the app is ok  but everytime i want to use the application i need a new access code,1
i made a payment with this they charged me ,1
login fine activation code no problem transfer money to make payment no go its just a screen with no buttons either im missing something and i need that money to but glasses or this site needs some work help,1
not only is this just a minibrowser to their awful webpage but its also making users get an activation code  which requires email access or phone use  both of which require you to leave the app at which point the code becomes invalid thats if you can remember it in the first place im very disappointed in chase the bank of america app is much much better,1
i was pissed enough when chase started forcing safari into using the mobile version of its site  please add a link to the standard website  chase mobile is practically useless  after weeks of waiting for a useful app they give us the mobile web site outside of safari   how do you add remove edit payees cancel payments edit payment amounts schedule automatic payments  why cant this giant of a bank spend a little money and make this app as functional as the standard web page  because of the forced mobile version in safari i have to get on a computer to edit payments,1
its rather ridiculous that it requires a new activation code each time you attempt a login  its as good a user experience as using dialup,1
cant even log in keeps asking me for activation code,1
this app is very slow and i often get timeout errors  for now i prefer to use the safari version as it is much more responsive  the look of this app is better though and you can save your username,1
other than the quick reference to atms and contact s this is no different than logging in using the safari browser  it can save your username saving you a bit of time i liked it better when i could log into the full website version before they launched the mobile site,1
the chase web site uses a secondary security system that requires a device to be verified now and then i suspect the use of a new ip address or subnet trigger a reactivation this happens offen when accesses the web site with atampt for reactivation chase sends and email or an sms with a  digit random code so you have to stop the chase app go to your email or sms app write the code down switch back to the chase app and start the whole process over again its an endless loop obviously the app developer doesnt accually use this app or else they would have made it easier to perform a reactivation this endless loop does not happen when access the chase moble site with safari because you can jimp back to the enter the activation page without renetering your username and password ive complained to chase a couple of times to no avail,1
the intro screens will have you thinking app is gorgeous but once you get to account view it seems they ran out of money steam and ideas ugly and clunky wth glad this is free,1
chase has really gone down the tubes i can never get into my account without verifying a very annoying code that i never get a text for so who knows how convenient this is since i cant get in as far as i got it looks like what it would like if you went to the chase site in safari  also very annoying since you need a code that is impossible to get since the site keeps giving error messages i wouldnt waste my time with this app,1
this app isnt secure me and my wife have a ipod touch and i logged in on my ipod and needed a code to be able to log in to my accout well come to find out i can now log in using my wifes ipod touch and didnt need a code to be able to so if my wifes can log into my account wo needing the security code any hacker in the world with an ipod touch can i think chase should a a way to check the udid of each and every device so that unauthoried ipods cant log in,1
so its simple straightforward plain and it didnt take a lot of code to make  thats something that used to be praised in a program  and its kind of the point of this appbanking with this app is quicker and more streamlined than using safari on the iphone or even on a laptop and it is definitely faster and easier than pulling out your bank card and hunting down an atm  and even if the latter is what you absolutely have to do this app will find your current location and tell you how to get to the closest atm  nothing special but what more do you need  cute animated characters voice recognition a levitation feature and an option to deposit free money straight into your accounttheres definitely nothing groundbreaking here  just the bare necessities for your banking needs which is all i want in a free banking app,1
ok so heres the deal if the app doesnt recognize your iphone it will ask to send to you activation code via text phone call or email the first two will cost you and the last one will keep regenerating new code each time you exit the app to go to your email  if you have unlimited texts unlike me then go for the text however be prepared to write it down and not exit app to go copy the code w new copy feature w  as it will require a new activation code request upon return,1
doesnt work with says it doesnt recognize device but then when i do the whole activation code it just does it all over againwhat kind of brainless idiots are working this app way to fail,1
the app is always in troubles to connect to the account every time i have to enter the activation code totally dissapointed,1
every time i open the app it tells me it does not recognize the device so i have to get the activation code and reenter my code and password getting very annoying plus only shows maybe three transactions at a time,1
please fix this new activation code glitch is this an iphone gs or  issue sigh ,1
so was a wamu customer but this app doesnt support those customers even though i was forced to get a chase username and passwords online this would be a great app if only it would acknowlegde me as a customer,1
i try to connect but always says cannot connect to chase wtf havent been able to use it,1
this is a good app super handy and especially nice to have in tight situations but the only thing wrong with it is that everything is in a plain text format and it doesnt take advantage off all the great features of the iphone or ipod touch it doesnt have any maps for finding locations or atms you have to search for them by entering an address or zip code or we you cant even use the built in gps to find your location once you have a location it only gives you a list that you have to click on to see where it is in google maps and then if you want to look at more you have to open the app again and log back in all in allhandy but could still be so much better,1
it just gets me frustrated how it says didnt recognize this device then sends u an email for a verification code of course u gotta exit out of the app to check the email so when you go enter the verification code it tells u the same exact thing again that it couldnt recognize it and sends another verification code so it goes around and around grrrrr,1
installed and attempted login but chase online banking said it needed to confirm the device chose to have chase email the new code then left the chase banking app to move to email app on iphone to get my code and when i returned to chase banking app found that there is no way to return to the confirm identity page horrible user interface errrori cant believe they didnt test this scenario so now i see the cannot connect to chase  error ill try to uninstall and reinstall the chase app and this time will get email from computer not iphone when performing the identity confirmation step hopefully that will fix it this is very disappointing,1
only one major problem each time i try to log on from my phone it claims not to recognize the device and i have to go through the process of having chase text me an id code for security i appreciate the level of protection but it makes the app a bit of a pain suggestions,1
i love it finaly a real native app instead of that ugly webapp bull shi  cant wait for future updates zzz,1
i just updated the app and now it doesnt take the underscores in my user name if your username has underscores or other characters dont update,1
i didnt do much with this app in the x series saw tonight that it was updated so i did an update to  well id say more about it if i could actually log in to my account apparently special characters are not allowed in the password and apparently the username either from another review i mean come on youre a bank why dont i just make my password  and then tell the world im sorry but this seriously makes me wonder what they are thinking,1
i think this app is just about perfect it does everything i need it to do and now that it is  iphone native and no longer simply displays the mobile site it does it elegently the only reason i gave this four stars instead of five is ive never been happy with having to get a code whenever i use a new device i feel my username and password should suffice,1
apparently i cant even log in to this app since i came from wamu using my online username and password i only get errors thanks for making this a total waste of time since wamu doesnt have an app of their own is this coming in the future,1
i just opened a chase account an had to get the app this is so much better than bank of americas and its so user friendly would never guessed it would be so good  its easy to use easy to conduct business on your iphoneso much more more then bank of american  i give  out of  for the ap ,1
great improvementawesome app,1
dont waste your time with this app  it doesnt work it never lets me pay my bills it always gives me an error code,1
terrible this is just a stupid simple browser  wamu did not have an app for iphone but when you went online it had a iphone interface that was way better then this one there are no buttons insted you have to find underlined writings tiny to get back and fort ones you are in your account you have to scroll all the way down to find the hiperlinktiny says back to my accounts there is no thought put in to it to make it iphone friendly at all where is my ballance at the transaction  point to fingure what happenned at that time period i have to go to a computer to find out than you have to get a activation code than if you went back to this app you have to get an error that  divice is not recognized and get an other activation code and on and on they are smart enough to buy wamu but not smart enough to make a smart app for iphone they can buy all they want they should not own you terrible,1
one day this app just stopped working i enter my username and password and poof back to the iphones home screen i deleted the app and reinstalled it same deal if anyone has any advice on how to fix this id appreciate it because if youve ever tried to get phone support for anything from chase youre probably still angry ive been given a case number and transferred from person to person spoken to supervisors tried again and again no one ever calls back why try so hard you ask because chases web site doesnt fully support safari and they wont even say theyre working on it i thought the iphone app would save me from installing another browser but no such luckand now that i see in other reviews that the app doesnt do business accounts im not even sure i want it at all,1
am i supposed to just rate the log in screen  cause thats as far as that damn thing will let me get itd be awesome if i could use a mobile banking app for mobile banking but i guess i was expecting too much from chase,1
would be nice to see branch hours and to find an atmbank location by zip code and not have to turn on my location everytime,1
why do i need to have you call me with a new activation code each time i want to use your stupid app great idea for security with desktop computers which always keep the same ip address not sure if laptop users have the same problem each time they try to log in at a different location but what a crappy idea for security on the app fix it,1
but for some reson when i did the update i cant log on no more asking fir a code and i request one but i never got it so if you xould fix that,1
how many more times is it going to ask me to go through the process of entering an activation code even though ive already done it no thanks ill just use personal assistant,1
have to obtain a new verification code every time i try to use it started using it cause page one doesnt show my credit card transactions anymore and despite the writeup neither does this one would be more useful if i banked through chase but all i have is a credit card and i wanted to be able to monitor transactions as well as account balance fix this and get more stars,1
need a new verification code every time,1
the application makes payment errors i thought a payment was processed but it wasnt chase charged me with a  late fee and wouldnt remove it,1
good to see all the chase employees writing glowing reviews but for the rest of us  both the web and iphone access  the login process requires an activation code each time now with the iphone app i just ran around the login process three times and still it greets me with smile at the door but no info on my accounts driving to the bank is easier,1
cant login i enter my username and password and thats it app quits and im back at my homescreen,1
it wont let me type my screen name cause it contains dot wtf,1
stinks i can log to my account with great effort and entering a activation code every time either on my iphone or computer i call chase and they dont have the knowledge to help i even brought the phone in and showed a manager the issue and of course he had no clue what to do haha he said i should of called i think chase hired all laid off pawn shop workers,1
the clean interface makes it visually appealing more so than the boa and ing apps which is a good thing along with being able to do quite a bit on the app while on the go my only complaint is that there are certain features the other banking apps have that id like to see in this one for examble the boa app shows half of your username while ing out the rest if you choose to have your username remembered this next thing might just be me but the search for branches and atms seems to be all done through the location detection on ipods st gen iphones and gps for the newer iphones so wheres the option if there is one to manually type in a zip code or even filter out your search by atms a branch or choose to show both like i said great banking app but id like a better search expirence,1
i used to use this app literally several times a day since the day it came out i have had to do the verification code several time which was very inconveinient but i got through it eventually a couple days ago it tried to use it and the screen turns white and says i have to get an update so i did it over the air and didnt work tried via wifi didnt work i tried it hard wired in my home as i do most all my updates and still a screen turns white then the normal blue telling me to go to the app store for the update  wtf this is getting really old so now i waste there time by using one of theyre paid people to do business i need i have the latest iphone update i have updated al my apps and the phone has been reset twice now and still no go if they can fix this it can be a great tool but until then it is a huge waste of bandwidth,1
waist of time with this app i had to get an identification code everytime i tried to log on because it wouldnt recognized my phone so dissapointed star,1
its great i requested the activation code i got the response email immediately and logged on with no problems for a fat finger user  i like the fuctionality better than the pc online chase banking version  this application is a must have for urgent visibility to account balances  money transfers to cover those weekend spending overdrafts and for any bill you forgot to pay  i havent tried the wire transfer function but just knowing its available is conforting  thank you chase ive been looking for a shirt pocket banking application for my phone andor ipod for years and ive finally found it,1
i try logging on to view my accounts it says its having trouble showing my student loans accounts ive been out of school for  years wtf,1
its just a mediocre strippeddown version of their web site even the branch locator feature is virtually worthess without the gps locator turned on you should at least be able to search by zip code we should expect more from a company that reported a profit of  billion last quarter,1
quite annoyed by frequently asking me to enter the code unuseful,1
the most frustrating problem with this app is that it rarely lets me actually log into my account every third or fourth time i try to use it i get to an identification screen with this message we dont recognize this mobile device as a precaution we need to verify your identity before you can access your accounts please request an identification code to help us identify youi appreciate their caution i do i dont want anyone with a random iphone and my wallet or statement to be able to get into my accounts at will my problem is that the code goes to someone else involved in the account so i have to have them forward it to me i have verified my device a dozen times now since i downloaded this app i have not uninstalled the app i have not restored my phone i have not dropped my phone in maple syrup making it sleepy lazy and forgetful in frustration i spoke to chase mobiles tech support just now and they told me that they are aware of this issue and are working on a solution but that they dont have an eta for the fix the last update was in december so im guessing that this isnt a huge priority for them the second big problem is that you cant access many past transactions only a handful of transactions are displayed at a time most of the screen real estate is devoted to useless white space surrounding the transaction information that makes it look pretty and built you can go back about three pages then you get stuck in a loop and one of our accounts fills up very quickly with small daily transactions like lunches so no good for researching a transaction more than a week or two oldyou cant add or edit payee information under billpay so if you need to change an account number or even find an account number you have to go online anyway this is primarily what i downloaded this app to do and it works well as long as you dont need to double check anything that is if you can log in to the account in the first placethe one feature that i do like about this app and which seems to work well is the wire transfer feature that allows you to move funds almost instantly between accounts now if i could just log in and do that that would be greatso wait until they decide to get off their bums and fix the mcapp theyve got posted here and use something else or stick to the website,1
was enjoying this app until i upgraded the os and it asked me to enter an activation code that would be emailed to me problem is even though my email address is correct on their web site and i get emails from chase the stupid thing will not email me an activation code this has been going on for about  months now ridiculous,1
just continuously asking me entering activation code again and again finally i decided to get rid of it,1
i dont like having to go thru the steps to get an access code to recognize the device when i want to log on  if i had time to get an access code id have time to call go to the bank or get on my home computer to get my bank info  not mobile friendly,1
people are complaining about having to go online to set up and get s code blah blah blah ummm thats safety they are helping you be secure so not just anybody can access your account grow up people stop being so damn lazy ok now that i vented i must say this app is flawless i constantly use this app to check my balance pay my bill and see my transactions after i make a payment i always take a screenshot of the confirmation page just for safe keepings incase something goes wrong but never has  i wish capital one had an application,1
i type in my complex password on the iphone cant login i need to get an identification code texted to my phone have to leave the app the text is formatted in such a way that i cannot copy just the id code out of the sms message so i walk to a computer to write down the code manually i restart the app i have to enter my complex password again then prompted for id code type that it manually then type the complex password one more time now i can finally use the app,1
i was able to transfer funds from savings to checking to cover a transaction while i was at the store two days later i was already in bed and forgot to pay the gas bill got my iphone jumped to my account and paid my bill in a few seconds the initial security setup for the activation code with text messages and email failed in every attempt for my wife and i so we tried the phone call instead and it worked for both of us we are both very happy with this app  great job chase,1
wish i didnt have to wait for a security code every time go to review my account,1
stuck in about screen  even if i press done button its not going back to home screen do i need to exit to login again,1
i have to get a new security code every few weeks  truly annoying  im uninstalling,1
it forgets my device every time i log in after not using the app for a month so i have to request a new security code in the june  version i cant schedule a payment after the current month because the next month button is on top of the log out button did they test this app at alli use the discover app to pay that card and have never had these kinds of problems why make an app that is harder to use than your own website,1
what good is it when you have to request an identification code each time you log in from the same iphone it gives me a this mobile device is not recognized message each time requiring me to request an id code via email even though i already did that before and had logged in from the same phone real convenient,1
this app is very helpfulif you can actually log in less than  minutes this is the third time now that ive been told my phone is not recognized and i need an id code this means you have to request one to be emailed to you wait for the email write down the code on something other than your phone provided you have a pen and paper handy because it will log you out if you have to check the email on your phone as well and enter it with fingers crossed because if you try to reenter the one you requested you know last time it didnt recognize you it doesnt always work and for the record i use this app on a semiregular basis the app itself i would give  stars but it kind of defeats the purpose if i cant get on the darn thing,1
absolutely cannot stand chases identification code system no other online banks use this awful idea i have to enter a new code more often then not please leave this feature out of the os verson,1
lowered my previous review to  star two updates within a week both requiring new identification codes completely unnecessary and irritating   while i appreciate the need for security once i have verified my device future upgrades should recognize that verification couldnt care less about the multitasking as i would prefer not to stay logged in when leaving the app,1
great app but deposit button isnt there wtf,1
needs retina display support for iphone  hires app icon and the deposit feature to actually show up in app i cant find the damn thing anywherefix those issues and it can be at least  stars from me,1
i wasnt going to rate this ap til they released quick deposit from your iphone that feature alone is worth getting the ap took me  minute to figure it out and saved me time and gas from having to go to my local branchonly complaints  doesnt allow me or give option to deposit to personal checking only to business account so now i have to transfer funds  in general having to reenter a stupid verification code every time chase doesnt recognize aka forgets my mobile device or computer  so annoyingwould rate  stars if those two issues were fixed which i hope they are soon,1
every time i want to log in it requires me to use a verification code that has to be emailed called or texted to me to get the code i have to log out of the app then go to another app to get the code then log back into chase reenter my password plus the code just to log in this app is so much more work then worth its easier just to call the bank and get your info there,1
depositing by taking a pic of a check omfg that incredible,1
i give it s because there is no option for free money anyone have any extra you can send it my way  i would love u forever,1
impossible to log in  not worth the trouble  i have  pcs and every time i try to log in from either of them chase insists it is the first time and requires a security code to be emailed or smsd to me to validate my login  same story for the iphone  what a hassle,1
this app is exceptional deposits from youre phone what more can you ask forto the person giving one star because of the low res graphic how does this change the functionality of the app  stars would have been more appropriate to the fool that cant login sounds like a browser issue thats clearing your cache or not saving cookies if you dont know how to use a computer you shouldnt use oneive never been prompted for any kind of code on either the computer or the iphone,1
every time i sync my phone i have to get a new authentication code cause the app doesnt know me any more  fix that bug snd i will gladly up the rating,1
just as one of the reviewers said i am not able to use check featureit says an error has occurred try againfix it if you need  stars,1
this app is really great my only issue is that i dont live near a chase bank amp it does not allow me to put in a zip code so it keeps saying there are no atms in your area  other than that it works great,1
wow  this is great i had a very long check and i only had to take the picture  times also it was hard for the bank to read the amount because of all the stars in front of the amount finally it worked   i love it seeing that i live in a small town without a chase bank i have to send it in the mail or take it on my next trip to our other home in florida i only wish i could make larger deposits our check deposits tend to be in larger amounts maybe they will allow that in the future ,1
wtf why cant i deposite checks i dont even have the button on the bottom all i have is my accounts pay and transfer and more someone help i updated and everything,1
every time i try to sign on it says it doesnt recognize my mobile device and i have to get a code texted to me this is inconvenient i can sign on through safari without a problem,1
wtf chase can i roll back my version this update doesnt allow special characters in the password how about we all just make our banking passwords consist of just numbersoh wait maybe i should just find a word that i like in the dictionary then make a few letters capital security people securitydont you all preach this this is a bank for petes sake,1
despite having had three phone sessions with chase technical support i am still unable to use this app  i continually get error messages that my password and username are invalid  this has been the most frustrating experience i have had with my iphone which i have had for  years a case has allegedly been open to resolve my nonfunctioning app  oh and a rep changed my password permanently without telling me he was doing so,1
i work for a chase branch and all i can say is that this app is great other banks dont have this i am not giving it give stars bc i work there i am giving five stars bc app works wonders and chase is not dumb they know why they doing as far as limit goes cant complain you can sit on your butt and deposit come on how cool is that,1
i wish you could search for atms by zip code as well as by current location thats how b of as is,1
chase you need to rethink your login logic why require an authentication code that can be sent to my phone when i am trying to sign in using my phone that does not increase security of my account if someone stole my phone or i lost my phone you should really just remove that part of the login because it is way more annoying and frustrating than it is securing,1
this is what i have been looking  forits easy and clear thank you,1
update from my previous review gets an aditional star for push fix  push notifications fixed   whats with the rewards points section yea its great that we can see our points but why are there  different tabs that both show the exact same thing pointless would be nice to see one tab show you points and another show how youre accumulating the points or how about a link to the ultimate rewards mall when the closest locations comes up for atmsbranches how about you design the app so it doesnt take you out from the app to show you the location  show us locations of atmbranches without taking us out from the app and how about an option to type in a search for atmbranches via cityzip code search sometimes i wanna search up before i get to my destination  your chase quick pay is not quick it takes up to  days to sendreceive money from someone w an external account that bs i can get the money faster with a check or cash but then again if i get a check i cant use your check deposit feature on the app because it doesnt work always comes up that its unable to read the check or funds cant be confirmed wtfwork on these topics and perhaps  stars are in order till then nope thanks,1
i have to take a picture of the check like  times to get it to work would be faster and less frustrating to go to the damn bank fix that,1
i like the push alerts now but i cant clear the updates the deposits dont work either keeps saying im not signed up for it but i cant find out what needs to be done i guess overall the app is fine now that u fking corporate thieves cant rob me via fees anymore eat  chase bank,1
i will be closing my chase account at the end of dec our free checking wont be free for very longso people lets all close our accounts and move to a bank with free checking,1
i use remote check deposit flawlessly i transfer money between my accounts flawlessly i can do anything i want to do with my bank account with this app quickpay i have yet to use but i like the feature i love this app and its part of the reason i am still with chase imagine i live in an area where there are no branches within  miles of me and i bank with them no problem compared to other bank apps for the iphone this one reigns supreme,1
this is another great thing chase does that makes it a great bank to do business with this app allows you to make a deposit from wherever you are by taking a picture of each side of the check it helps you find local branches and atms its put together very well and is easy to navigate to whatever you want to do check your balance contact chase for assistance pay your bills transfer money between accounts or send it to others its just plain terrific,1
kudos for the effort but many things make this app painful to use of  checks it only accepted one the daily limit is too low too sensitive to blur cant figure out that  is  doh  if i am going to do the work of jumping through you ui hoops chase then you need to do the simple things right,1
if you have a chase account this app is needed depositing checks with my phone has saved me many trips as for getting the loading error when trying to take a picture of the check the cause is most likely a cydia app interferring probably adblocker try removing that application,1
for people that have jailbroken their iphones make sure to delete the adblocker app from cydia that is whats causing it to not take the picture to deposit the check,1
to login is such a pain typing a + letter code is annoying make it so you can have the app login with a pin similar to an atm then if the user trys to send money or something it can ask for a password that will keep it just as secure incase someone does watch the pin being entered,1
i really like the app and the bank but honestly the check deposit feature has one quirk that is disappointing it will not let you make any deposits after your account has been in the negative for a number of times yes i admit i wish i had more money to keep money in the bank but gas is kicking my butt  when i do have money to put in the bank the bank is closed after i get off leaving me to wait until the weekend and allowing them to make more money i understand late charges but what about when i have the money to put in the bank the app does not fix it  if i can physically go to the bank and make as many deposits as i want i should be able to do the same with the secure deposit feature,1
wont take my password still now im locked out called the  they asked me some stupid security questions like how tall am i   or  im  how the hell am i supposed to answer that correctly needless to say im still locked out and mighty pissed use some of that money we all gave you banks and hire people who know what they are doing,1
the locate atm never works  it pulls up atms from almost  miles away from where i am and theres no way to refresh or put in a zip code i wish you could sort to find just branches as well,1
location feature only works based on your current locationlame  i would like the option of looking up based on zip code or near an addressnow that would be useful,1
this app is great and i love the alert management system able to schedule payments and everything  instead of complaining and giving  star for not offering a zip code atm lookup why not email support and simply ask for that feature i bet it will be in the next version and is it really that which made you give a one star,1
check deposit doesnt work after i take the pics and send it says unable to connect to chase please try again later lame,1
i had two checks to deposit when i downloaded the app the check for  worked fine but minutes later same light same background and same makeraccount of check to be deposited for  i got an error message annoying seeing balances okay but i can do that on computer,1
it used to work and i was really happy about that last month it just stopped working after making clear pictures i get an unknown error and suggestion that i should bring this check to atmbankwth edit finally  they fixed it with current update thanks,1
great appi dont download many things  my iphonebut this  work perfectlyfrom scanning checks  deposit to my accounts or finding out who directly took  from personal amp business acctsgreat app people,1
overall the app works pretty well but as others have said there are some major problems with depositing checks  it used to work much better but lately almost every check has a problem  here are some of them that ive experienced today when depositing several checks character recognition doesnt recognize amount correctlywhen the amount from the character recognition doesnt match the amount you type in it doesnt let you go through with the deposit  in my case it thought the amount was  instead of   this was for a printed not manually written amount  after about three attempts it finally recognized the amount correctly but ive had checks where it never figured it out  you should be able to override this like the routing number and account number it will frequently misread the routing or account number so you have to be really careful in doublechecking this  most recently it left the last digit of the routing number off the most frustrating one is after ive snapped the front and back of the check and typed in the amount i click next and it says that it isnt able to connect to chase even though i have a strong connection  i have to try up to ten or more times before it finally connects  it is even more frustrating when i finally connect and then  above happens and i have to resubmit and it fails to connect again after trying  too many times the interface gets confused and either the app crashes or the ui gets all messed up where it overlaps images of two screens and loses all the data that i had entered including the images other times it doesnt say it wasnt able to connect to chase but it does return some unkown error and says to try again later  sometimes trying several times eventually works but other times it doesntthe other features of chase mobile seem to work better but i dont use them as much so it could be i just havent run into the problems yet,1
i travel a lot i need to be able to plan key word where a chase bank will be in the next town i travel and i would like to be able to do it by entering a zip code rather than by current location makes planning my trips difficult i guess i have no choice but to stick with bank of america,1
i would like to search for atms and banks by zip code or city rather than current location also it keeps saying i have one notification and then when i go to check the notification there is nothing to check so its just a little annoying to have a notification when really there isnt anything to check otherwise it works great,1
good for viewing balances and recent transactions and thats what i use it for most of the time but the rest of the app can be pretty irritatingsometimes i want to search for atms by zip code and not just by current location and when i actually did want to find the closest atm to me a few days ago it didnt even get it right  the distances were relative to somewhere a few miles west so i ended up having to guess where the nearest one wasand i just tried to log in a few times and it said mobile banking was unavailable which is reasonable   am is an acceptable time to do their site maintenance but i tried one too many times and got an alert saying my account is locked for too many login attempts that would make sense if i had guessed the wrong password every time but not when i couldnt log in because of maintenance,1
i keep getting an error message that says i cant login even though i typed in the correct username and password i can login using my desktop browser so why cant i login on my iphone,1
excellent app but create a  digit passcode login feature as optional to bypass the username and password screen  im tired of doing this like  times a day,1
hey every  needs to download this free  called hck nts and enter in this bonus code idjdash  i just got a ipod for free,1
this is a good appworks perfectly,1
new jersey zip codes do not work fix it please,1
one con cant add payee if zip code starts with a ,1
this is a great app the only problem i had was trying to add a payee to my online bill pay  the payee zip code began with a  and it wasnt processing  if the zip code began with any other number it would have been fine  overall the app is awesome,1
the app shows a lil number on it and idk how to make it go awayit keeps alerting me and its anoying,1
this app has everything  perfect for shop a holics that like to check there balance from time to timedepositing my check is so easyon my break i just deposit it instead of waiting till the night  to get to a chase,1
it wont even allow me to log in it tells me i need a confirmation number because i just downloaded the app i know this is normal once i have the code sent to my phone and try to use it to log in it tells me that my username or password is incorrect when i know for a fact that neither of them are wrong ive tried about five times to log in and keep having the same issue forget this app,1
i understand the need for security especially on a mobile phone every time i try to have a code texted to me it has never worked i have been on the phone with them multiple times and they were uncle to fix it only way i get in is to have an email sent to me each time,1
getting to the point where i dont like the way it is login in it is not login in at all why i dont think it is rightplease tell me the problemthank you very much and have a bless day have i had chase to long on my ipod  wanda g bannister,1
i try to log in and it tells me it doesnt recognize my mobile device and that i need an authorization code so i get the code emailed and texted to me and the stupid app tells me the same thing all per again when i go to the site on my laptop my password works perfectly fine so irritated,1
after updating my alerts wont go away,1
web login has a  and since the update i cant enter in my username field so the app is worthless who writes this crap you would think jp morgan could hire an intelligent software designer,1
i have checked the alerts for all of my accounts and the badge wont reset i have turned off all alerts still wont rest i have deleted the app and reinstalled have to obtain a new device authorization code when doing this and badge will still not reset just to be clear there is a little red  badge on the app icon and there is a little red  next to more when logging into the app darn thing wont reset and go awayalso there is no email contact for support with the app,1
doesnt work anymore it was convenient at one point thoughnow it wont allow me to login even though ive not changed my password or username ,1
this app worked great since i got it and this last update makes it so that my username andor password is wrong constantly please fix this so that the app does what it was created to do,1
ever since i installed the second to latest update the app keeps crashing on me i cant even open it i have to delete it reinstall it and then it finally gets me to the log in screen however as soon as i flip the remember me thing to remember my username it instantly crashes and will no longer open again i had hoped this latest update would fix this but it didnt i check my account a lot via phone so this is a huge inconvenience   plz fix immediately,1
this app is use less dont get it rejects your password all the timeapp assistance doesnt help you at all they tell you to check with chase dont get this app please please dont get it save your self the worries,1
i wasnt able to log in and now its says i exceeded the maximum log on attempts number and my username locked before downloading this version everything worked fine very disappointed,1
this app used to get  stars before when it actually worked now when i try to see my activity it simply shuts offchase get on it fix this asap,1
have had the app for about a month it is fully updated and i received and entered the code for my mobile device every time i log in it tells me it cant display my acct info on a mobile device and to go to a computer and manage my device from there seriously waste of data time and storage space,1
this app is complete fcking garbage now it does not work keeps crashing get it together and fix it does not work for iphone s apparently,1
first time using and needed a branch not near my work location  i couldnt enter a zip code to find a branch to a location i was visiting later on that day  are you kidding me  also scanned in check for deposit and it told me it didnt like the routing code are you kidding me  it was cut from another bank  i deposited at the branch which i found via the website not the app and all went fine with the deposit   work on flexibility please,1
 include a passcode lock so that if stolen someone cannot see my username or attempt to guess my password lock me out of the app every time it closes use passcode lock to get back in you can log me out after a short period just as youre doing now other than that the app is great fantastic work really i use this app all the time and this type of progress is why i use chase thank you,1
the app crashes constantly on launch which may not be chases fault but still everytime i reinstall it i have to go through the process of setting up the app again which is cumbersome and frustrating involving them texting you a code and hoping that that code actually works wish they had made it more user friendly all around,1
i recently signed up for a chase pre paid visa card im able to view online amp have a username but when i login mobile it says i have not created a web versionbut the guy did tell me that the cash a check thingy would be availble mid aug i have no idea if thats maybe the reason because its prepaid but i am able to login via web hmm so all i can do is give it  star sorry,1
tried to update it and now it wont even download wth so effin annoying,1
used to work great on my g the few times i tried with my  and now s no luck youd think the sht supposed to get better not worse,1
does not work with upgrade apple ios chase needs to make it compatiblecan not do transfer or bill pay tried deleting and reinstalling to no avail this app is useless chase needs to do something,1
i cant download chasemobile,1
how hard it is to fix the code you have enough money to pay the developers hey how about if you package upcoming versions as derivatives and sell them to other you dont even have to fix the bugs,1
the version  or  crash doesnt finish up download amp also the size of mb when up please fix it i really that app  thank you,1
not even able to go beyond login screen now have already to reinstall itworthless app,1
its still not working after the update yesterday its still slowhelp,1
wish more than one username could be saved,1
i also had trouble with this app once i upgraded the new software this is what i did to fix it i turned my wifi off then deleted the old chase app and reinstalled it then it prompted me for an access code the system then sent me a text with that code once i entered the code i was finally able to access my account hope this helps,1
my husband and i both have the iphone  and everything was fine until we updated our ios to to  and now every time we want to use the chase app we literally have to delete the app download again receive a new access code then sign in  awesome  just awesome  plus we have iphone s on order and judging from the other reviews were still going to be screwed when we get those  way to go chase developer  way to go,1
fix this times out on wifi,1
this app wont even let me log in anymore it just loafs forever and then eventually times out or forwards me to an identification code page and then times out again it use to work just fine i dont understand,1
this app is not even working keep asking me to enter an identification code when i do its it just keeps loading i could never enter im frustrated need a new app for chase,1
and then the update just ruined it now when i try to log on i get the weirdest message saying null code or not found ,1
very useful,1
used to be very handy and i could check my balances whenever i wanted but now i cant anymore because i times out right after i put in my username an password,1
chase passes blame on to apple by saying its their faultjust build a better app and accept the blame,1
this app does not work it wont open on my i long enough to even login please fix it the update for ios did nothingupdate i discovered that if i dont check the remember user id box upon redownloading the appthat it works fine the bug is somewhere it that part of the app codesofor all of you that the app doesnt work fortry deleting it then redownload amp do not check that box when logging oni hope this helps,1
ive had my iphone  for over a year now and chase up dated there app for the iphone s and up so now i cant use it any more what a pain in the butt i loved it till then i could pay bills at work on break with out having to find time to get on a computer,1
i have tried to log into my account so many times and it says that my username or password is incorrect but that is not true i can log in on my computer but not the app on my iphone ive talked to customer service and still no one can figure out why it wont log me in im very annoyed,1
i wish i could rate it minus  stars for not allowing it to work on any phone before os  i dont understand why bankscompanies like this insist on alienating customers in this wayi know its partially apples fault for not allowing my phone to go past  because they want to try to force me to buy a new phone but i also know that maintaining backward compatibility is possible and not that difficult to doif they had never made the ability to deposit checks by phone i wouldnt care but thats why i got the app so now they think its a good idea to give many thousands of customers a low class slap in the facehey chase what a great way to destroy customer relations and pollute the air at the same time since now ill have to get in my car and drag my butt into a branch just to deposit a check,0
requests an identification code but then never sends the text or email  ive tried numerous times just uninstalled,1
cant log in the request identification code page crashes every time,1
first it asked me to log in then put in an identification code then says sorry unable to connect for countless times come on this app makes mobile banking totally not easy,1
i havent been able to log in from my phone for roughly the passed  weeks it keeps idling or showing an error message its become a pain in the butt is there anything i can do on my part to have been luck with logging in,1
i used this frequently until the forced update now i cant login  it keeps telling me that chase doesnt recognize my device and the code they sent doesnt work,1
had the app for a year and it worked great then the update months ago and i have not been able to log on since tried deleting the app and reinstalling it several times to no avail just now i reinstalled it hoping they had maybe fixed it since its been several months but the same issues arose downloaded it and installed it and went through the whole verification code ad then nothing been trying to log on for  min and it just says it times out deleted it once again so annoying,1
have not been able to log in for days deleted app and reinstalled asked for new activation code then still would not connect fix this app want to deposit checks,1
doesnt work at all big bank shouldnt be experiencing these challengespls repair when u can and consider ipad as wellmany thanks,1
i have to tap thru  more  alerts  alerts history  select account  checking just to see a stupid alert i shouldnt have to tap  times to see an informational alert tapping alerts  taps in should take me to the account that issued the alert or show all the accounts that have alerts so i can tap thru them maybe an alerts screen for just alerts  tap manage alerts sb in the settings pretty great app otherwise,1
keyboard remains on screen after selecting done unable to continue the bill pay process while keyboard on screenwhen will this get fix it makes no sense ever other update this becomes a problem,1
i cant even login at thi point  i can move from screen to screen with my login and password even to the point of requesting a new auth code and getting it bia email  however when i finally press login it takes about a minute and then says it cant connect to chase  total waste of time,1
i cant log in every time i try it either sends me a security code and doesnt work after that or just tells me to try again later i tried deleting it and redownloading it and it still wont work,1
oh how this app has saved me a few times at the grocery store checkoutswhile clerks were like cool you can transfer money in seconds yes sir love itthe alerts are annoyingbut does everything have to be perfect thanks chase,1
you have to reload everytime that you want to use it someone needs to work onthis app,1
its no easier to use than logging onto to their site from web everytime i log on it says request identification code cuz it doesnt recognize my device hello its the same one ive been using even b the useless update it takes foreverzzzzzzzzzzoh gosh almost fell asleep waiting for it to load,1
every time i try to login i have to updateeverysingletime  how much changes in two days  it is ok to use once i remember to go back but limited on what you can do vs the desktop site,1
this app is so awesome and helpful when it works when is the key word i use it to deposit checks for my business but after every deposit i am unable to log in again i have to uninstall the app reinstall the app login request a new identification code wait for the text with the new code and relogin  this is getting so old,1
i can handle all of my banking needs using this app i pay all of my bills on here and manage my money at my fingertips please fix the save username bug thoughjust a little annoying ,1
wont remember the user name fix it,1
the app worked fine until the update now it doesnt remember your username very annoying,1
this app was already having problems and the latest update has made it worst it freezes and kicks you out half of the time will not remember your username please fix,1
love this app but as of the latest update it does not hold onto the username it always has in older version otherwise the app does as promised,1

ever since updating to ios  i cant log into my account  they are usually good about updating this app fix it,1
lost the chase app unable to download it again from the app store,1
recent ios  update has killed this app  pros  checking balances making transfers paying bills from my phone  awesomeness cons consistent crash issues with the alerts gets updated works but eventually goes back to crash fail not the most glamorous aesthetically nice if list of closest branches included a map with pins if im in an unfamiliar town addresses dont do it for me unless i plunk each address into a gps overall app has been very useful and saved my arse on a few low balance occasions,1
i used this app all the time but since ios  update i cannot even login anymore using the app disappointed,1
ive seen many complain about being unable to connect after updating to the ios i simply uninstalled then reinstalled the app works like a charm for me and hopefully it works for you guys too,0

the fact that this app hasnt been updates for ios  is a huuuuge problem for me i dont currently have the internet set up at my house so ive always used this app to move funds and check balances however ever since i updated i cant log in judging by the other reviews almost everyone is having the same problem why hasnt this been fixed yet up until ios  the app worked flawlessly im severely disappointed that now i can only check my bank balance at work until i get the internet on my home computer,1
the app works but the fact that you have to dig two to three layers into the app just to dismiss a notification is nonsense chase please take a look at the new gobank app for ios  its banking done on the most beautiful and userfriendly way sincerelya loyal chase banker,1
enabling cookies in the settings for safari didnt work either for the app to work in ios tried rd parties enabling and to never block cookies but neither worked ,1
i have not been able to log into my acct using this app since the update can we get a bug fix chasedo not download this app if you have ios people,1
if youve upgraded to the latest version of ios  this app no longer allows you to login to your accounts,1
fix it u lazy ,1
while the appservice has worked fine since i updated to ios  the ui is still showing the old keyboardtoggles please update your ui to match your new icon,1
can log into accounts but depositing checks now is nearly impossible after ios  update,1
decided to dl this app even after reading all the reviews of it not working with the ios because under details it said it is now compatible with it however once i tried to log in a message immediately came up saying i had too many failed attempts at logging in of course i know all my login info amp it was only my st attempt at logging in but i tried it again anyway being extra careful to put all my info in correctly amp i still received the same message amp couldnt login so much for chases convenience claim for this app now i still have to drive over  minutes away to the nearest chase to deposit my check the old fashioned way,1
until the ios update this app worked well enough so that i would use it over the desktop version but ever since the update the chase mobile app hasnt worked i continually get the cannot process your request at this time error to say this annoying is putting it mildly update amp fix this soon,1
transfer money from savings to checking  view account balances deposit checks with no haste works with ios   what is everybody complaining and being so nitpicky about this app has been great for me not sure why the rating is so low or what people are complaining about,1
since upgrading to ios  this app has not been working fix,1
not working since the update to ios,1
cant log on ios ,1
still not working after ios upgrade should have figured out how to fix by now,1
this app hasnt work since i updated to ios two weeks ago its really frustrating and on top of it all i see no sign of chase working on fixing it they could at least put out and update or alert that lets people know when they can expect the app to be up again i do pretty much all of my banking on the mobile app,1
since the ios the app doesnt work please do something and soon,1
stopped working in ios  for a month now need a fix,0
chase developersplease keep up with new os updates from apple plenty of apps were ios  ready yet the chase mobile app just isnt a friendly experience while using this updated os i feel like ive been using the same chase app since it launchedcome on guys amp gals can we please have a sexy ios  app that lets us bank like bosses your disappointed memberd,1
this app has been unavailable since i upgraded to ios almost  weeks ago chase fix this already i used it all the time before and really appreciated the alerts whenever money transferred in or out of my accounts,1
have ios  works fine for me try deleting app and reinstalling,1
wont let me sign in every since ios please fix app is worthless right now dont download till they fix it,1
doesnt work with ios  no excuse why after weeks being out chase hadnt rolled out an ios  compatible update,1
ever since updating to ios this app wont let me log in useless,1
ive seen a lot of posts where users cant log in i have had the app for a long time now and even after the ios update it is working for me i am using an iphone  it may be possible that the issue of logging in can be solved by rebooting the phone i have found this to be the case with other apps so since i can use it my only complaint which started with the  update is that i keep getting account alerts that i have not signed up for currently the alert count is up to  it isnt as bad as it sounds though  when i actually sign in to view the alert there arent any and then the little alert badge on the app button goes away until the next morning tomorrow i will have  alerts ,1
app is pretty much useless since the ios  update its been a few weeks now,1
since the ios  upgrade my app has not allowed me to log in i called chase and the only answer they could give me was to uninstall ios  seriously  if you guys cant figure out how to upgrade your product i dont have a lot of trust that you can protect my money thank god for fdic,1
with those of you that can get to the error message youre doing better than me my app crashes immediately upon opening every time cmon chase i would actually like to use this app,1
i cant believe its been almost a month since the ios  update and this app still isnt compatible i cant log in ever since the update please fix,1
still not working since ios  i called support last weeknot helpful and clearly doesnt read these reviews,1
still cant log in since updating to ios so frustrating,1
has not worked since ios  update,1
i love this app works great with ios ,1
doesnt work ios ,1
needs to be fixed poor customer service that mobile banking is still down,1
to fix the issue of not logging in one must delete the app and app data then go into the settings then into safari settings and then choose to never block cookies,1
after ios update the app doesnt work  read all comments below,1
login is not working since ios ,1
i enable cookies for safari but i still get this message i have tried everything and nothing has workwe are not able to process your request at this time please try again later been getting this message every time i try to log in well i actually fix it by reinstalling the app work for a bit then it back to the same message i cant believe its been weeks and no bug update from chase or at least to know that there working on it,1
like others have said app displays error message right after login and becomes unusable this happened three weeks ago after i updated my phone to ios  come on chase fix it i am giving it  stars since it was okay when it worked,1
 stars until app is fully optimized for ios  and design is flatter,1
no longer works  do not bother if you are using ios ,1
app worked fine before,1
on  different iphones and an ipad and trying ios and now ios the freekin app crashes almost every time when you go to take a pic of the check for a deposit  you must know about this by now  its extremely frustrating  fix it please,1
ever since ive upgraded to ios  the app wont allow me to sign in,1
this app needs to get redesign for ios  its outdated and ugly looking,1
i am not sure if chase app developer have tested this app in ios  or not but it simply stopped working after the os update by the way the app itself was updated before the ios  is released in the anticipation for the os update anyway the error i get is same as others have got cant log in right now try again well i have tried to log in for several day thinking that it may be a server issue turned out that i not the only one who has this issue unfortunately there is no other message also if we need to take any extra steps to correct it nothing on the website no acknowledgement of broken app this is not what i am expecting of chase,1
i havent been able to access the app since the ios release please update its very inconvenient to login from safari,1
this app has served me well ever since i downloaded when it was first released but since i upgraded to ios on my s i havent been able to login so until this issue is rectified i cant give it a better rating,1
new version with ios  needs cookies enabled in safari id rather not have to blanket enable cookies for all my web browsing but ios  both the chase app and website require them and ios  does not offer adequate tools for managing individual cookies,1
i wrote a review saying since the ios  upgrade it hasnt been workingsince then hundreds of reviews wthe same issue amp no changes has been made im going to report this to apple cause in beginning to think the app is not so legit,1
i cant request an identification code  hence the app is useless,1
ive tried amp tried with this app but i really dislike it before and after the update to ios  the check deposit feature has not worked for me ive tried everythingdeleted and reinstalled many times turn phone off for a few minutes i called chase tech support they were totally useless the first guy even told me he wasnt aware chase had an app its now deleted permanently,1
since updating to ios  i get the same error message as all the other reviewers just hoping to add my review to get tech support to fix it before the update the app worked great,1
app works great for me not sure what everyone is talking about ios  and all,1
great app but broke after upgrade to ios  my fix was to go to settings gt safari gt block cookies and changed the setting from always to from third parties and advertisers i rebooted the phone after that and the app started working,1
even with ios  i havent had problems i love how quickly the checks i deposit go through and i appreciate this app since im not currently living near a chase atm or branch love this app and again im very thankful that it exists so i can do my banking remotely,1
ever since the ios update every time i try to deposit a check it crashed unexpectedly its getting really annoying ,1
needs a fix  have not been able to access since ios upgrade  used to be a great app,1
where is the new ios  keyboard,1
the fix to the issues is to allow cookies in safari to enable logging in  i had  alerts since upgrading i could not get to and now works just fine,1
since upgrading my iphone to ios this app no longer recognizes my iphone as one if my authorized electronics  soeach time i attempt to access my chase accounts i have to reregister my iphone first   pain in the a,1
hesitant to download based on the many star reviews and claims that the app didnt work on ios but so far its worked as expected i can log in check my balance and make a payment must have had an update since the other people installed it,1
since the ios  upgrade i can no longer deposit checks i dont get many checks but this app made the problem of entering a bank no longer an issue now the app no longer recognizes the routing number properly on  checks to be deposited,1
since the upgrade of iphone ios i cannot make a deposit the system kicks me all the way out of online banking attention it manager,1
i am giving one star just for the reason that i have used it before and its a good app but this has become useless after upgrading to ios  other financial apps are able to authenticate i dont know why chase can not implement the same thing,1
cant deposit checks anymore using the camera error every time dont update your app if its going to get worse,1
this app will not allow me to sign in after upgrading to ios  on my iphone  good thing chase isnt my primary bank,1
once i downloaded ios  the app no longer works error message come up once i sign in and says to try again later loved the app before please fix it,1
since the latest update to ios this hasnt worked at all like others i get the cant process at this time error  typical big bank crap,1
every time i try to deposit my check the app suddenly crashes  please fix this  before the ios update i was able to deposit checks with no problem dont have this feature if it doesnt work,1
crashes when i try to make a deposit since i updated to ios  app needs to be updated to work with the new operating system,1
wish the app an ios  lookthe recent spending list is still completely cluttered and hard to read why is there a ragged black border around the corners of the appbut app works well,1
the chase app works fine for me on ios  i just tried capital ones app with swipe passwords and it is awesome i havent used their mobile app until now because of my very long and complex passwords which would take a minute or so to enter on a phone and i would probably need to enter a couple times due to errors swipe passwords means i can set and use a memorable swipe pattern and get logged in in seconds on my mobile device and i can keep my password very complex with chase i have to keep my password shorter and simpler for mobile login and feel i am not as secure,1
i can sign into the app but depositing checks through the app no longer works thats the only reason i used it in the first place great job chase,1
loved this app when it worked since updating the iphone software it wont take a clear photo for deposits beyond annoying,1
i have had no issues using this app under ios works well to access your bank info,1
i have not been able to log in since i updated to ios  i called it is a known issue we are working on it  weeks is not working on it  weeks is ignoring it,1
downloaded and ran just fine a good basic app,1
works fine and lets me pay my bills dont need it to do anything else i have ios  turn on your cookies like it says and that may solve your problem,1
i have been unable to sign on since the new update seems this is the same issue a lot of ios users are having i use this app a great deal and need it fixed,1
its not ios  not your isp cell carrier i was able to get their developer involved and it was resolved it was near impossible to get to happen harping problems contact support through secure mail for their site not here or by calling them,1
my app works fine but come one now chase its time to update this app for ios already all the money you have and you are the only one of my banks that hasnt update your app yet this app is so ios,1
ios nd workks perfecttt  ,1
icon isnt bad but navigation and overall feel is just as antiquated needs to have the ui similar to ios ,1
chase you guys have got to update your app its slow limited in features and looks old time for an ios  overhaul please,1
keep trying to sign in on my phone but i get an error message ever since ios,1
since ios  unable to make mobile deposits picture will not snap,1
ever since ios  it shuts down when trying to make a deposit too bad there isnt a zero star rating,1
not having any issues with the app since it was fixed to be compatible with ios or the ios updates fixed it very convenient,1
since ios i get a notification circle with over  notifications on the icon as soon as i open the app and get to the notifications page they clear only to reappear with  minutes on the icon more of an annoyance than a functionality issue but i keep the app on my home screen so its a glaring bug please fix or ill switch banks probably not,1
the app works well except it needs to be updated to integrate the ios  appearance,1
i just downloaded this app and it works perfect with ios any previous issues must have been addressed and corrected,1
its dec and this app still hasnt been updated for ios ,1
any plans to update the visuals to match everything else i use it so much its starting to be jarring how old fashioned the app is beginning to look,1
seriously i dont think you guys are lack of money to do this,1
this user interphase feels boring really you guys need to update the app you guys charge your customers money for everything and cant get an app updated ios  interphase feel and look soon please,1
please make more compatible with ios  the old look looks horrible,1
its been how many months and how many updates and no ios  gui ridiculous,1
you idiots not every app needs to be updated to an ios  look geez,1
please update the app to support the new look and feel of the new os it currently looks outdated and plain ugly,1
i have ios  i cannot make a payment so yeah its completely crappy and useless so annoyed delete,1
ios on iphone s app keeps crashing when trying to take a picture of a check for the deposit first picture front or back works fine once you try to take a second shot app crashes please fix,1
loved this app i dont even go to the bank anymore i do everything at home work or on weekends this app works great and i dont mind that they dont have an updated for ios  thank you chase,1
i have ios  and an iphone s the app crashes when taking a picture of a check for a deposit,1
i dont know why people are giving this app a one star just because there hasnt been an ios update yet this app works fine if you need to transfer money between accounts check your balance pay bills and perform some other banking needs ive recently had an issue with the check deposit portion of the app but id imagine thatll get fixed this app is very secure and i would recommend it to anyone who has chase its fast and easy,1
this app works as intended but just like the chase website there needs to be major user interface improvements its sad how long it has been since a major update hopefully user improvements will be made soon especially for ios users,1
please update to an ios feel and look thanks,1
good app love how i can deposit checks from home i just wish it could be updated to ios,1
still not on ios  yet,1
useless app on iphone s with ios  now  camera crashes it,1
looks bad needs ios update,1
basically needs to match ios look idk,1
this is so frustrating to see this app still not optimized for ios  yet keyboard is horrible chase gotta do better would expect the lateness from a lesser known business but not chase,1
i wanted to deposit three checks the first one went well but the app crashed in the middle of me taking picture of the nd check reopened the app and the nd went in okay but the app crashed multiple times on the rd check ended up power cycling my iphone and finally the rd check went in aggravating,1
everyone needs to quiet down the need for an ios  update is unnecessary but i do agree having to type in the password every time i use the app is absurd,1
as the title,1
the camera isnt cropping the check image properly and app says the image isnt clear enough for deposit this worked before  i updated to ios ,1
no excuse for chase not updating their app for ios this app used to be awesome the industry stand for what mobile banking should look like usaa has absolutely dominated them app wise i might be leaving soon and closing my accounts if they dont get their t together,1
looks outdated needs ios interface big time,1
the app is great for basic needs such as checking your balance and such but the check deposit where you take a picture of the check and send it in never works its very disappointing this is the biggest improvement needing to be made besides a more technologically advanced look for ios,1
and not ios friendly,1
no update for ios  when will it be updated,1
people are whining for no reason works great no ios  look oh no what ever shall we do,1
seems many are complaining about this sb fixed asap,1
needs ios  update pronto,1
i have an iphone s with the ios and upgraded to the new chase app no problems here i use it mostly to look at my account balance and pay bills never tried to deposit anything through the app have always used either the atm or the bank itself for that who cares what the app looks like it is functional and efficient why does everyone think everything needs to look like the new windows,1
 need external transfer need a hinttip when i receive this error message upon attempting to access the transfer screen eligible transfer accounts i dont mind the legacy non ios look,1
its been quite a while since ios  came out but this app is still not updated since getting an iphone s the chase and jp morgan apps both dont frame deposited checks correctly the image in the guideline when depositing isnt even close to what winds up in the photo  resulting in a lot of trial and error,1
need more compatibility with ios  the keyboard for starters and look and feel of app are still like ios  they need to update this,1
no complaints here about no ios it will arrive chill it does its job and i love the mobile check deposit,1
i use check deposit iphone s all the time  last night i tried  or  times and it crashed after taking photothis am the same so i shut down the iphone and restartedworked perfectly  needs a patch for ios to fix,1
it is a good app but its very clunky and needs to be cleaned up and redesigned for ios,1
update now so it can have ios  keyboard then ill put  stars,1
the app has been very good and reliable up until the new apple update to ios  i dont care about an old looking interface i just want the deposit to work the app kicks me out every time i try to take a picture of the check please fix soon,1
a decent app that gets the job done the app isnt updated very often and is starting to look dated among other ios apps,1
chases mobile banking app does not show individual transactions nor differentiate between pending and authorized transactions  the only thing the app does well is report the balance of the account other than that this app is useless,1
it does everything it should its annoying how many taps it takes to clear alerts also wheres the optimization for ios  this is the last app i have that hasnt had a redesign for ios  or at the very least updated the keyboard its not a huge issue just an eyesore,1
good app but needs to be optimized for ios  icon is ios  style but app isnt doesnt make sense other than that works really good,1
this app is old please update it with the design and layout of ios also please take discover app as an example and make the statement available on mobile app also make it easier to switch from personal and business accounts by saving the username thanks,1
the apps design feels like something for ios  needs a more ios  facelift looks and interacts really cheapwish it had a passbook notification like american express has its a pain to have to type in your password every time you get a purchase notification my work around is to disable the badge icon,1
the chase mobile app among other banking apps really need to be updated to the ios  interface the app is old and outdated and really needs a change mechanically it works fine other than the occasional crash when trying to use mobile deposit,1
the app itself gets the job done but i would love to see the interface updated for ios  and made easier to use once thats done youll get my  stars,1
i use to love this app i was able to deposit my checks into my account without any problems lately every time i try to deposit a check using the app it closes and i have to renter my username and password when i try the second time and im taking a picture of the check it closes itself once again because im try to deposit my check using the mobile app i do this multiple times until finally i give up my frustration fix it,1
come chase this app has a terrible design when are you people will invest some money to get a decent looking at for us the customers and clients,1
i do quite like this app i just wish they would update the interface for ios,1
this app is great and easy to usecan you make the icon a brighter white color like the rest of the ios  apple icons it looks too full compared to the rest of them its not flattering,1
really needs an ios update,1
i dont understand why the app hasnt been updated to ios  yet,1
the functionality of the app works just fine for what i need however the apps ui seriously needs to be updated to the ios  look and feel this app unfortunately has been neglected for the past several months and should be redesigned for a more updated feel,1
the ui looks clunky and old it would be nice to have a faster way to log in like a log in pin it also needs to be updated for ios ,1
i love chase but i think the app has to have an update for the new ios keyboard and make it look more modern,1
i love this app but it needs to get updated to ios alreadythen i will give this app  stars please update soon,1
i would like the app to be updated for ios  and have a more native feel instead of web like right now overall the design and the flows needs a big update,1
update keyboard amp ui to ios  look and feel  thanks,1
app works great but it needs to be updated to the look of ios  its been months and still the same look,1
why is this app still using the ios  and below style keyboard its been almost a year that they announced ios  this is absolutely ridiculous,1
this is without a doubt the worst banking app on the appstore its inconvenient to have to type my password in at all times i would prefer if there was a four digit security code to punch in furthermore,1
i really have adopted mobile banking since starting to build my credit i absolutely love the discover card app and i recently added a second credit card to my collection that is a chase card i think chase should take some pointers from the discover app this app needs a major facelift more intuitive layout and sleeker design overall it works but its pretty horrible keep up with the times its not even ios  optimized,1
this app needs to update to ios  it hurts my eyes to use it,1
this app must to be updated to ios  look amp feel soon its unacceptable that after more than  months that ios  was released chase mobile app hasnt been updatedi really hope see this app updated very soon then will be when i give back the  starts,1
chase needs to update their to feel like it matches with ios  it feels ancient i hate putting my password each time i login need to have a fourdigit quick login update your app chase,1
this app is good and still gets my  stars but needs an update it just looks outdated and old i havent had any problems with the app as i just use it to check my current balance and history so i cant speak for its other features all in all give us an update for a cleaner look for ios,1
i love this app mostly it alerts me when my paycheck is deposited and when my rent check clears i can transfer money and pay my chase credit card but ever since upgrading to an iphone s i can no longer deposit checks i see other reviewers have the same problem i took the pictures over and over with the s and was told each time they are not clear enough luckily i still have a s and it was able to deposit the check on the first try both have ios  ive never been able to successfully make a deposit from my smy only other issue is with alerts i love being alerted when transactions happen but when you have an alert you tap the more tab which has a badge then the alerts item which has a badge then the alerts history item which has a badge but from there on you have no idea which account the alert was for as there are no more badges youre left having to go through each account to find recent datesoverall i enjoy the convenience of this app and with a few bug fixes and improvements it could be great,1
please update to ios  it has been too long that the format has stayed ios ,1
ios  has been out for  months and this app still used the old keyboard it seems small but its symptomatic of the overall feeling of the app it needs updating but since it hasnt been since last year i wont hold my breath,1
the check deposit feature works about  of the time and when it doesnt i have to restart my phone and try the deposit all over again but this time suddenly the app doesnt recognize my mobile device so ive gotta do the whole verification code crap further delaying the deposit of my check what a wonderful service,1
come on guys you couldnt change any of the design in the app itself to at least match the new icon you made for ios lazy,1
i think its time that they update the software so its made for ios  its just old now its been te same since like ,1
this is the only app that i have that doesnt look like all the ios apps please update ,1
much better looking,1
still some of the ios features are not utilized for example swipe to go back n forth is missing,1
love this new update very sleek and modern user interface,1
this app is worlds better than the previous version clean ui same great features id like to see an optional quick login feature with a  digit code and id be hugely interested in doing something along the lines of the app check directly through my main bank those are both ambitious requests but after this update it seems like the sky is the limit very impressive,1
finally ios  design but what about a digit passcode for easy access,1
the new app is beautifully designed from a ui and ux standpoint took forever for you guys to deliver an ios  designed app but i think it was worth the wait now move on to redesigning the actual website with the same feel as the new app,1
the old version of the app was old unusable and outdated this update however completely changes that it is like a brandnew app it is easier to use and far more aesthetically pleasing i recommend you download this app as it has significantly better with the ios  update,1
its faster and works great with the ios  finally the updated we needed,1
im pretty sure i can speak for everyone else that uses this app wanted to see a new clean ui for ios  and i must say well done chase well done,1
looks beautiful nice touch with ios ,1
id been waiting for the ios design of the chase app for a long time and this one is pretty disappointed the user experience is not as smooth as the previous one too much information on one screen and why would you repeat pay amp transfer features on the account screen when you have it on the tab bar please fix the hierarchy of the information of this app,1
finally its what ive been waiting for what took then so long anyways im glad they updated the app i use it alll the time,1
much betterand needed update to ios designs,1
chase started with the best banking app and fell way behind for a while especially with ios  coming out but i must say that this app is very well designed functions well and has now taking the crown back,1
glad to see your ios optimization i am able to see your hard workplease include some features like quick lookup of accounts instead of logging in every time into the app  just like discover,1
this is a great appvery nice job chase i love the new ios  look n feel it is easy to use and has all the features that i want aaa+++,1
looks like the same old act redesigned for ios  offers nothing new usaa blows this app out of the water,1
the new app from chase is beyond amazing i love the new ui interface and with the new ios  integrated the app is smooth easier to use and the same way we had used the old app from chase if not better i highly recommend this updated app its very organized amp easier to make quickdeposit on your own mobile phone thanks chase,1
great work on the new lookfeel for ios   well done,1
an update for ios ,1
loving the redesign will continue to play around with the new app but the ios  design is very clean and concise great work,1
the chase mobile app has always been functional but visually unappealing until today the newest update features a stunning ui fit for ios keep it up chase,1
i have to admit i absolutely love the new updated chase mobile appespecially how it greets you when you log ini really like how bold the transactions showsand the added secure message box for those who dont have a computerit really would have been nice if it would greet you by your name as welllike it does with my discover appother then i am so glad chase updated the app to a better layoutso i had to give it five starsi just cant wait until they finally update the tabletsor ipad version,1
very user friendly ios  friendly,0
finally redesigned for ios  yasssssss but still cant transfer money to or from an external account within the app despite being able to do so from a computer years behind chase this is why i closed my checking account  cant wait to drop you altogether,1
soooooo prettyyy sooo cool ,1
ive been ever curious when chase was going to update their app to fit with ios  and voil much welcomed improvements both in how the app works and the overall visuals great work,1
this ios  update is amazing i love the simplicity of it all  thanks so much,1
new look but im not impressed the functions and number of taps to see your account is the same i thought this version would look better and more ios  like,1
loving the new ui for ios good job,1
its got a nice design my phone has automatic update on it so i got an alert from chase that logged on from my phone just like every other week got rather confused since it was a different set up but its definitely a step into ios and a sweet design,1
chase just updated their app to make it more ios compatible and it looks awesome,1
i commend your work but the only thing chase needed to change was updating the check deposit feature so that i can actually take a photo the way the iphone was meant to  using the side buttons also implementing a swipe password feature like the capital one app would have been nice instead we got an even smaller window to input passwords but really though its looks pretty,1
finally ios  this app is unbeatable,0
amazing update i have the iphone  and it runs brilliant with the new ios  update it looks fantastic sleek and modern runs fast this update blows any other banking app out of the water chase definitely takes the lead in modernday technology,0
the design of the logo the new sleek interface thank you for finally upgrading to ios  i have been waiting for an update and this one doesnt disappoint at all,1
i think this app is terrific they did a great job with the design and calibrating it with ios  it looks smooth and easier to use to all the negative comments about the update well let me tell you something no one told you to update it that is why the provide pictures for you to see before doing it,1
love the new ui its great to see chase come out with the updated ios  look it seems snappier all around and is much easier to read the greeting is a nice touch and the app seems loaded full of polish its still just as functional as ever too definitely the best bigbanking app ive used now if only they could do a pin login like simple,1
awesome update chase its a beautiful design for ios  everything is working great so far thanks for spending the extra time to make this release a good one,1
i really like this update now the app looks professional and fit with ios  good job,1
this was one simple good app that never failed the new update messed up the look and feel just like the stupid ios  pls have an option to change the font if not for anything elsenow the letters are too big,1
i had no idea chase would jump from classic to modern it is such an amazing jump there are some reviewers who rare complaining about the updating being too bright or too big or laggy stop complaining and get a new device the iphone  or s is a little outdated everyone complained about ios  but got used to it soon just be patient,1
the old version of the app wasnt bad a all but the new update is just amazing the brightness the colors the speed it just talks to you optimized for ios chase is the best,1
considering the marketing put into announcing this new version i am surprised and disappointed architecturally this is the same app but with a modern veneer that somehow already feels dated why is there a skyline photo is good morning supposed to make me feel appreciatedthe touch points are smaller and harder to hit and the app feels slower overall as part of ios i would have at least expected a leftedge swipe to move you back but no dice it feels like they lost their way on this redesign when they really just needed to clean up the ui and add some ios functionality,1
i have to say the new update is pretty ugly looking for some reason the ui its more difficult to comprehend then the old whats with the weird login screen and the huge date on the startup screen i get that it supposed to look like ios  but that doesnt mean its supposed to look like  who hired the guy that designed this new version and the guy who approved the new design very bad taste,1
i use this app everyday and the new ios optimized version is so great i had to write a review thanks chase,1
im not usually compelled to write an app review but this new version is gorgeous  it matches the look of ios without deviating from your brand  well done,1
looks better and runs nice with ios  finally not sure why other people complaining not much of a big deal but the if looks a lot better,1
wow awesome ios design facelift looks cool,1
use chase everyday now cause this app is perfect love the ios  look and also for people complaining about its too readable i dont care if people see how much money i have and if you do you must be broke ha ,1
the app failed to recognize my mobile device multiple times making me type my password and username over  times and taking pictures forcheck deposits always crashes the app and it always crashes even with reinstall,1
crashes every time i try to make a deposit and does not remember my identification code so i have to request a new one every time i try to log on,1
not sure why it took nearly a year from the original developer release of ios  to update this app came out ok thoughid like to be able to view an image of checks presented for payment i realize this isnt the best place to request that but i dont see anywhere else to do so and ill be damned if im going to sit on the phone with chase for something like this,1
theres something to be said for designing for the ecosystem your app is going to be running has the person  team that designed this app ever used an iphone  ios whats up with the weird fake tab bar and wacky font choicesthis release is a step back  annoyed i updated,1
i like that chase has an app but im tied of always having to enter my password a digit code would suffice for quicker access just like the rest of my banking apps when i need to check my account in a hurry entering that info slows me down other than that its ok,1
a nice upgrade i would like to see a  digit pin to open the app and be logged in already instead of username and password just for mobile and username password for website very convent i saw this done in frost mobile banking,1
love this update the design finally matches ios  navigation is super easy to use and the layout is too the only feature this app is missing is the ability to schedule transfers to external accounts,1
crashes on ios when trying to take picture of a check to deposit it used to work great until they made the app pretty now its useless fix the bugs please,1
no complaints yet,1
i like the convenance of the mobile app and its possibilities in dealing with accts or paying bills seems like it was more fluid before ios app,1
the improvement and update for ios  is great absolutely love it,1
love the new improvement its much faster and ios  look,1
application is easy to use  very detailed w good formatinformation is always prompt,1
easily one of the best banking apps if not the best,1
i am david e harris jr and i am very pleased with the convenience and the professionalism of this appthank you for being a wonderful bank and making the mobil availability and satisfaction ,1
best banking appgood luck,1
great app didnt think i would use it much but it has been very handy to have real time access to my accounts,1
fonts are too small and do not scale based on accessibility settings seems much slower than the previous version might be new but not improved,1
i love this app and new ui ui is better than chasecom website,1
outstanding app every part is so easy to use,1
follow me on ig mrkb chase is great,1
love this new update its so much better than the old one,1
i was so excited for this i really theyd make a banking app that was good dont be fooled by the pretty login screenbeyond that its just as poorly thought out as its predecessor choosing to ignore ios  standards for no apparent reason its like the designers never used an iphone before user interface optimized for ios  no swipe to go back gesture support a huge ios  only featurebuttons and other ui labels are in caps log off it yells at you while you use it they also feel tiny and crampeda pages header is indiscernible from the buttons they use the same terrible type list items are a darker grey than the background making them feel recessed and less touchable  the opposite of every other ios appif you mess up entering your password it clears out your username too  beyond annoying when typing on a phoneaccounts page wastes space useless greeting and chooses instead to have cramped buttonsnavigation is confusing jumping from one place to another this is made worse by having unlabeled back buttons i have no idea where that button will take metab navigation icons are not icons just caps text over a heavy black bar unlike the light ios  feel i used to look for the transfer and deposit icons  now its just illegible textnot improving anythingyou still cant search or sort transactions by scrolling upquick pay is still buried under a thousand taps just to send friends money do you care about mobile payments then you dont want to use this appwant to find an atm well youll be staring at a list of text they couldnt even put in a map view so you can find themplease give this app a bad ratings so they actually make an app worth using be critical hold it at higher standards than facebook vine or twitter these people are responsible for your money we deserve a better app,1
the app runs very smoothly and is a pleasure to use with one exception the quickpay option says i have no payees when in fact i have several other than that its great,1
much improved finally matches ios ,1
its great to have the bank access on your phone love you can transfer money and pay bills on your phone,1
i really like the new look and the overall improvements to the app,1
the ui is a great improvement over past versions very clean and easy to navigate it takes advantage of the ios  look amp feel i now prefer to use this app over using the web site,1
look amp feel of this app is on par with ios  features superbly developed,1
everything they put into this app makes it easy and simple to use the one thing thats annoying though is if you have a push alert show up and you have to go into the depths of the app to make stupid app badge notification go away other than that its great though amazing customizability,1
it fits in to the ios  scheme and its pretty it does everything i need but i havent delved into any of the features its must if you have a chase account,1
lets me do everything i need to do interface is clean and flows well styling matches ios i have to say i do miss the old look of the app but i will take function over form any day all in all i like it,1
working great,1
great way to check my balance and keep doing what im doing,1
im still getting use to the ios  updated version but overall its a good app my only suggestion is the ability to just sign in with a  digit code instead of constantly entering your password,1
i like the app its really convenient and gives the information readily i would prefer for it to have a code for a password vs a word its too long and logging in takes a bit i would also rather the balance of everything would be deducted instead of pending and waiting for it to upload the new information also i found taking pics of the checks takes a bit of time to get a proper pic but over all i love the app,1
beautifully designed for ios  this app is clean great looking and very functional,1
i use this app nearly daily and love it took me a little bit to get used to the new look of the latest version but i actually like it,1
i love how its integrated with the ios  feel features are what you would expect as if you were on a computer or laptop,1
this app brings the essence of ios  to light its simple and minimalistic it looks very clean and nice and its not as laggy as the previous versions kudos to the developers they did a fantastic job,1
the new ios update is cool liked the look and feel,1
i love this app i can see whats in my account at anytime always at my fingertips makes banking easier,1
this is the most convenient app ever especially with a busy schedule not having to get a verification code for each new computer its seriously life saving love this app,1
love the app simple and easy to use i have direct deposit so i dont ever step foot at the bank all transactions are done through my phone,1
easy to use app and the interface is nice and clear with the new update,1
i have always loved my chase app i rely on it a lot the newest update is nice but i dont like not being able to view all my checks and i cant click on anything to view it still i use it almost every day,1
i love this app im a full time college student and it allows me to check my balance schedule transfers and most of what i need to do the only time i use chasecom is when i need to look at a check that has been processedthe only thing i would wish for is that the app could flip with my device when i turn it,1
excellent app no issues i would suggest one thing though the full username is visible when you save your username apps such as bofa dont display the full username,1
yes the update is great the interface looks awesome but i must honestly say with the update it tends to freeze  i would also say that the passwords are old news i think the four digit code like some other apps would be wonderful,1
reduces how often i need to go to the bank,1
great way to check up on accounts and transfer money love the new ios  interface,1
works without a hitch using latest version of ios  only negative is a relatively lie limit on deposits per daymonth,1
see title,1
great refresh for ios ,1
love this app,0
the new ios  version of the chase app is much easier to navigate and makes finding the information youre looking for much easier it performs better has a more modern look to it and is by far their best release of the chase app love it,1
always been a great app nice refresh for ios ,1
i still cant find my account number on the mobile app something so simple but missing from all the other futures are very nice specially the ability to take pictures of checks to make a deposit online without the need to leave the comfort of your own house,1
the previous version displays the remaining balance for every transactionsthis is better because of better awareness by the consumer on how his transactions flow relative to money coming in and out with the balance appearing alongside each,1
a great app with excellent features easy to use and meets all of my needs in a compact package from my phone allows me full control while im on the go thanks,1
i love the new design for ios  i also like how you can see your citys downtown as your wallpaper the most important thing i like most of all is the fact that its safe,1
this app makes banking on the go super easy the reason it did not get  stars is because i believe signing in should be easier than having to type the password every time all other apps of this nature provide a  digit code for logging in which is much faster add this and you got  stars,1
easy to use deposit checks using phone,1
simple interface is easy to navigate and easy to read great for checking balances and activity on the go,1
made just right for ios   perfect,1
i really like this app its easy to use and very handy when you are on the go and need your balance i also have  teens with student checking and i love that i can transfer  from my acct to theirs via the app instead of having to meet my kids somewhere to give them cash when my oldest borrows  til payday i can also transfer back when he gets paid its helpful for them to use the app too and learn how to manage their moneythere are a couple of minor issues that prevent me from being able to give this  stars first  things will sit in pending status for days second  checks rarely show pending like everything else  they just show up this was an issue when i wrote a check and the person didnt deposit it for  months i checked my balance in the evening as i do almost every day and it was fine and then the next morning i had an overdraft charge because my account was overdrawn due to that check i was charged  if i had seen it pending i wouldve put the  in my acct and third  i wish i had access to acct options such as turning onoff overdraft pulling from savings like you can on the website if these are addedfixedetc i will happily change my rating as it is a really good app,1
one of the best mobile banking apps out there great interface and easy navigationhighly recommended,1
i like all of the functionality and the power of what i can now do with my phone allowing me to pay bills xfer money and check up on transactions rapidly and with great ease,1
great app works well nice design that fits with ios wonderfully,1
it is extremely beneficial and convenient its one of those apps you will use everydayno problems no crashes stars,1
this app has saved my butt on so many occasions i dont know what i would do without it love it,1
very helpful appi use it every daynice upgradelooks better than before ,1
i just would like to be able to have two user names saved,1
great app always works perfect and never any issueseverything needed at your finger tips,1
mmmhhmmmnn yess it is defiantly the correct banking appif you are a chase customer,1
awesome app works well with itouch th gen thank you,1
do not like the new update especially the homepage why is there a picture of someone fishing haha dont like my username being exposed and i dont want to type it in every start up i liked the old version better and this new version looks like other banking apps its not unique anymore so thumbs down heres a tip if its not broke then dont change it,0
this app is just great works well and all the necessary info is just a click away,1
this is an excellent app where you get to see your deposits and withdrawals you can pay your bills and transfer money ,1
i really enjoy my chase app its easy to navigate for business and personal use i wish there was a shorter way of entering your password like entering a code instead of putting the entire thing in but thats minor,1
buena app sper til cuando estas lejos de casa para manejar tus finanzas,1
i think it was about time to update the app it felt archaic compared to the way everything else in ios  was going good job guys,1
the app is great it works good and easy to read i love itit keeps me up to date on my account balance,1
much cleaner and i am able to navigate this app significantly smoother  since the update good stuff for quick on the go banking,1
this version of the app is very nice it has an excellent theme that fits right into ios ,1
im glad that chase has updated the mobile banking appthe new design is aesthetically pleasing and more functional,1
chase continues to set and raise the bar for mobile banking and this app is no exception although from an aesthetics standpoint i dont prefer the flat trend of ios this app has great functionality and stability,1
nice ux interface streamlining and visual design improvements to make it more ios  compatible big improvement glad we moved to chase,1
i have multiple accts at chase and so far no issues with the mobile app as for the color of the icon you people are never satisfied so what if the app is right the app works thats whats important the complaints are beginning to seem idiotic ,1
the newer version is awesome it is easy to navigate and the text is very clear perfectly designed for ios ,1
the app has a remember me feature on its front page pertaining to username i would prefer that the username have a feature that allows it to be redacted when the app opens up as a security feature  much like other banking apps,1
i downloaded the app hoping you can compose a message in the secure message center and you cant both this and the mobile website dont allow this i dont understand why not i dont have a normal computer also every single time i try to log in again with this app and the mobile site i am told they dont recognize my device and force me to request and identification code then go to my email then put in the pini had to do this  times in the last  hoursnot at all convenientim sure there are ok things in the app but i still cant do half the things that are done on the full website,1
this app is amazing i love having my bank at my finger tips,1
new ios revamp is better in every way  aesthetics and functionality,1
extremely user friendlycouldnt ask for more,1
this app is very easy to use i love the  hour access it really helps me keep my budget in check,1
very smooth to use,1
this app does everything i need and ive never had a problem with errors,1
ive had bank of america  amp wells fargo and by far chase is the best bank and they have the best app  they help and take care of their customers thats other reason why me and my family only bank with chasescrew you b of a and wells crapo,0
nice apps easy to use,1
very nice compared tobefore love the ios upgrade and the streamline viewing,1
great app love it,1
our crew used to use different cards which made tracking our familys spending arduous this app has made it feasible for everyone to have a card for this account to which i receive text alerts per transaction verify balances and schedule payments since it is attached to my amazon prime account as well we are racking up the points thank you chase,1
this app does everything that i need quick pay has been a lifesaver on several occasions i would just suggest that the alerts notifications be put in such a way that when one logs in they can immediately see why they received the alerts instead of having to navigate through the app mintcom does this and it is very helpful and convenient otherwise its a great app,1
would like to see the developers create a better security at the beginning would like to see it hide partial to most of the username when you select remember me,1
i like the improvements to the app just wish it had a pass code option versus a password i see a lot of apps transitioning to that style of login now,1
very user friendly thumbs up chase,1
this app is beautiful now it looks like ios ,1
the app is great for checking balances and depositing checks by photo works perfectly major annoyance is the frequent need to reverify the device via txt code even that hasnt happened in a while,1
this is a great app easy to use and almost never crashes interface is beautiful with ios ,1
heres what is annoying about chase mobile apps this one and chase hsaany time you upgrade your app it says your mobile device is not recognized and you are forced to get a log in code emailed to you and relog in  super annoying extra steps and on top of this even if you go out to your email app to get the code chase makes you start all over my other banking dont do this for software upgradesthis makes me reluctant to upgrade chase mobile appsthanks for listening,1
excellent appeasy to use especially love the ability to take pictures to deposit checks,1
after installing ios  it has not been letting me log on please do something about it,1
much better than apps from other banks,1
account alerts are  weeks late the notification is too late to check if something bad happens,1
i like the beautiful pictures as backgroundit makes this app very nice looking as well as very efficient and reliable for all my banking needsyou will not be dissapointed,1
thank you chasekeep up the great work ,1
i love this appits so easy and convienant beats any other bank app,1
like it use it a lot,1
great app with a beautiful new look for ios well done jp morgan,1
simple fast and easy,1
i really like this app but it should be easier to transfer money to different accountsother than that i like,0
its nice to be able to review transactions but not being able to make a payment is really a pain in the butt,1
ive been using the chase app for the last few months mostly to pay bills it has a slick ios interface its clean and fast and it hasnt crashed for me yet i am happy with it,1
this new app has been a pain in the butt i have literally had to delete this app  times because it constantly freezes then i have to reinstall it again to know what is going on with my account the old chase app was so convenient and never acted up time and time again,1
i was pleasantly surprised when i reopened this app to find it more or less completely redesigned and with a fitting ios aesthetic functionality is about the same but looks fresh great job chase,1
ios  looking app great work,1
i love this app since the ios  update for the app,1
love it  i can c all my activity my mortgage cc savings amp checking  i love the check deposit feature  chase is my go to for managing my money amp paying bills amp this app is a huge bonus,1
the functionality of this app is impressive all the way around i have had no troubles or glitches ease of use and larger print are a definite plus i use all of this apps features on a very regular basis as my job involves constant travel cellphone bill mo fuel bill +mobanking made easy and on demand at my fingertips priceless,1
very well done latest updates have brought ios styling and the app fits in much nicer well done app clearly put some time and effort into this one,1
simple to install easy to use overall good app,1
have been using this app for a long time but the latest version has really refined the experience,1
i love that the chase app lets me deposit checks anywhere i just wish it could save login info locally i have a pass code on my phone and it never leaves my side anyway other apps that deal with secure data have local login storage features why not this one,1
the new ios  upgrade has rendered this app almost useless the grey on white skinny type makes reading extremely difficult the new layout is not intuitive mostly the lack of screen contrast and cramped layout are to blame anyone without perfect vision anyone over  will have trouble reading this app  chase please think of the end user not jony ives weird s      graphics aesthetic,1
its great its just a bank app and it does what i needso cant complain ,1
this is so user friendly it makes it so easy to access my accounts and keep an eye on bottom line plus being able to submit a check via a picture has saved my butt in a pinch,1
makes it easier to bank  easy guide to deposit checks remembers my username  secure logins and timeouts,1
i use this app constantly  its easy to use and it lets me do what i need to do from my phone  i like the simple and clear design and i have yet to run into a glitch,1
solid app with solid programming by the techs who worked on this app i have the s w ios and there are no problems with it shame on the people who did not give the actual developing team any credit with their one star reviews,1
i like this app very much i can check on all my accounts and get push notifications for all my accounts and also even take a picture of my checks and submit them to my bank love the new ios  update too,1
muy buen trabajo,1
thanks to this app i was able to find out that i had reward points accumulated which were converted into cash d,1
loved this app before and after the update the update pairs it better with the graphics of ios its simplistic and beautiful elegant and sharp works flawlessly not a single bug issue or other quick pay transactions go through in seconds overall this is the best app ive used for a bank and i love opening it,1
i hate it  three tries to write a review and it keeps erasing my text  wont give me statement view and i cannot register more than one device  when i switch between ipad phone and computer i keep having to get a new security code even my bank is not this fussy  chase get with the program,1
pros looks like it was made for ios cons displays current balance in a locked frame in huge font across top of screen  your balance can be viewed by anyone else on the bus or across the roomtransactions are not listed as posted or pending anymore so youll never have any knowledge from your phone if a transaction is locked in or if chase will wait another week to post it so that they can charge you another fee per transaction if your balance becomes too lowoverall  if i really cant tell if a transaction is posted or pending then this app is counterproductive  dont care about the new aesthetics function first chase cmon  i give it a d for dropping useful features to make sure the app appears modern and for removing my sense of privacy by displaying my balance large enough for anyone around me to easily read  get a clue chase,1
soooo much better than the prior app it is much more fluid smoother and functional than its predecessor love how modern it is too great app,1
love the ios  functionalityworks as it should fast and reliable thank you chase,1
i love this ios  version great app,1
great app one more reason why chase is my bank of choice wish the alerts section of the app would tell what the alert said instead of just indicating an alert was sent,1
i have an iphone s running ios  when i tried to remotely deposit a check after i photographed both sides the next button didnt work i tried it multiple times and nothing happened i even uninstalled and reinstalled the app and it didnt help,1
brilliant,1
i have been with this app for several years we have a relationship i have watched it change and evolve i have send it grow up into the fully adult version we use now it wasnt without a few tantrums but that which works does not do so without learning how toi recommend chase on this apps functional abilities all the time transfer funds in seconds go through transaction history pay bills it works,1
banking on hand anywhere ,0
very good app love it,1
its ok it functions and all its  just hard on the eyes because of colors being all washed out now  when all the colors are so light its really hard to see in small screens such as my iphone s which i love because its bombproof lol  they should consider not everyone has perfect vision or a big screen for mobile apps,1
this is a basic app and very simple to use works perfect on ios ,1
i have been waiting for month that chase could finally adapt the app to the ios theme now when i opened the app it fit so much to the ios theme this is more that what i expected good job of the team who update the theme of the app and good for chase to finally make the decision i love it,1
since im not wanting to upgraded my iphone  to ios  because i dont want all that waytoooverthetopsilliness layout i cant use this app now because chase wont allow me to update until i get ios  so they can look goofy like ios  also  why cant i still use the old app and just forgo access to the new stuff from what im reading with reviews though is that a lot has been taken away old one was working for me why cant i keep it i want functionality and ease not silliness from a banking app if i want silliness ill go download angry birds and get rid of your canned reviewbotpositive responses to boost your ratings youre not fooling anyone,1
this new ios  theme looks and feels beautiful great app + great banking  great life thanks chase,1
since the ios  update this has hands down been the best banking app ive encountered period all the other banking apps i use are clearly just poorly designed skins over poorly designed mobile web interfaces looking at you specifically wells fargo you can really tell that a lot of thought and effort went into making this app and i thoroughly enjoy using it and appreciating all the little touches that make it great keep it up,1
great customer experience,1
plz add some other way for securing it why do you want to generate code all the time r u really fool guysdo u have any other way to secure data worst thing in this app never saw such a bad design in any app,1
the update is working much better,1
awesome,1
used to work in landscape mode just fine on ipad now it doesnt  this is irritating  please fix it thank you,1
love the whole ios  layout app works very well and there are no bugs would be great if it looked the same online on a computer,1
this is a very helpful app does just what i need it to do,0
very easy to use also this app us careful about ensuring the privacy of the customer they didnt recognize my phone so they sent me a code for validation i think thats great,1
i enjoy the fact that this app will let me pay fast an easy as well as tip me off when ive spent to much amazon chase credit card is where its at,1
awesome,1
awesome,1
never had an issue with jpmorgans chase app and the improvements in the ios  update have made it easier to navigate and utilize the one aspect i took issue with in the past was the erratic nature in taking pictures of checks which thankfully seems to have been remedied,1
iphone,1
awesome,1
its alright everything is there well almost everything i still havent been able to find the recent transaction button so i would be able to view my usage or maybe just maybe there isnt one or maybe my stupidity have clouded my vision and common sense hopefully i overcome it its my main purpose for using this app jp morgan chase i know im only one person butt help me out when possible,1
does what i need it to do no more no lessmy major quibble depositing checks can be a pain because the app wonks out on this feature still ,1
awesome,1
this app has saved my butt a few times good job chase from one happy customer ,1
for some reason this idiots ask for an identification code every time i want to log in supposedly because the device is not recognized idiots,0
i love it,0
payments are easy once you finally set up your phone and get the identification code getting the code took forever because i couldnt get the text message  tried twice before using the phone call method logging in and getting it authenticated just took forever used to great and simple not sure what happened,1
awesome app comes in handy every time im about to checkout at the register or amazon,1
perfect,1
great app some feedbackallow me to set a pin code to access the app instead if my account password account password is long and not rememberable  allow me to sign up for the cash back rewards for your reward cards from within the app,1
it always signs me off when im checking my balances and making transfers  it keeps asking me for a security code either to my cell or email because it doesnt recognize the device  its frustrating and time consuming when im in a rush,1
awesome i love it,1
ive only been using this app for about a month and so far its doing great everything is in order user friendly i can access anything thats important to me through here instead of going through the browser overall its a must have app for all chase bank customers,1
app is simple and easy to usethanks ,1
app never remembers my device iphone so every time i use it i have to request the identification code  then enter it in  hate this app,1
i liked the old native app better i hate web view apps like it is now i use it if i have to but since its a web view its unbearably slow dont know why we have to suffer id rather use the browserupdatethe is slow i cant view my transaction details you ever hear of navigation drill down the html  version is even worse why can i not send a secure message do you even have a designer  that is not an entry level employee maybe you should test the app for performance and usability before sending it outoldschoolhater not always you ever hear of bill pay stop qqing,1
 way better than android,1
by far the best app right now   ,1
it seems that ever since apple introduced ios and its unpleasent debeautified design every other developer is following chase is no exception while good features and upgraded functionality is always welcome design is just as important this is a good functional application that gets the job done but if it had a better design gui then it can become a beautiful banking experience,1
what difference from previous version dont know and dont care i hate adopting ios  framework harder to to see things and seeing less valuable buttons of course thats not related to this app but asked bottom line it works and has the features i need,1
chicken butt,1
awesome,1
im a bit disappointed in chases app upgrade i had an iphone  that i was unable to update the ios on because of the lack of space on the phone suddenly my chase app forced me to update except it wouldnt allow me to because my ios wasnt current the chase update made it so i was unable to use my original chase app and i was unable to upgrade to the new one which left me and having to delete it off my phone altogether ive recently upgraded to an iphone s finally getting past the operating system issue this is an all around great app,1
this app crashes every time i try to take a picture of a check i tried everything including deleting and reinstalling it every time it crashes i have to make it recognize my phone again by requesting a code this is bad enough that id consider changing banks just to get mobile banking that works,1
it would be nice if i there would be an option to have a pin code cause i get really tired of typing in my whole password every time other wise its a good app,1
i feel comftorable using it the design is super simple and easy to usethats what i love about it i hope the app stays the same for a long time it doesnt need anything added or subtracted,1
its a good app but i get annoyed since almost every time i go to open the app it requires an identification code which makes everything take longer please fix this,1
cleanflat and streamlinedgreat job chase team,1
worked great before but after update it loads the blue screen then crashes iphone  on ios,1
i used too use this app everydayafter the update its not working anymore,1
the last update september   not work on my iphone s when i trying to opened the app was closed automatically,1
trashy update on  wouldnt let redownload the app once more why update the app with the apple pay feature when apple itself hasnt even release the ios update yet how stupid smh,1
when you download the app it says in order to use it with ios you will need to go to settings and enable cookies hopefully this helps,1
app freezes after initial login i have to shut it down and restart continuously slow interface it was much better before you cant redeem your points the app either gives you an error code or fails to load to the next screen requiring a restart the interface is lousy it seems like they copied citibanks app and screwed up like them it needs to be fixed,1
been using it for a while and it worked until nowas of  an update appeared the app store gets thrown into a loop and cant download the update its tells me the item is free and will be added to my purchased items,1
app crashes constantly on ios  on iphone s was fine before update,1
like many other people reviewed this app it crashes  when youopen the app it stays on the blue screen and nothing else,1
blue screen on startup and hangs  program never opens   happened after newest chase update  worked great before update  uninstall and reinstall did not work  iphone ios,1
after submitting username and password nothing happens,1
the chase app could learn something from amazon allow us to sign in with touchid,1
i dont like to write bad reviews amp i tried to contact the developer instead to rectify the problem but theres no contact info available nearly every other time i try to log in to the app it says it doesnt recognize this mobile device amp makes me request a new identification code this is such a pain i would also like to be able to view checks which i can on other versions otherwise its a good app amp i appreciate having it hopefully the bugs get fixed soon,1
i only use this app for my amazon credit card and it helps me keep track of all transactions and balances up to date does everything i need it to,1
login screen doesnt work on iphone  with ios  therefore this app is worthless as of the last update,1
ive been trying to access my chase account for last   days but it wont even download the update i have never had a problem with this app till nowfix the glitches i need to use my app on my iphone,1
this app crashes when i take a photo of a check every time i try makes the the mobile deposit feature completely useless on a s ,1
i can no longer take a picture of my check for deposit with the latest update  it looks as if the bluebox area for the check image is getting cut off on the right side  maybe incorrect dimensions  please fix  i was able to deposit on the older version of the app running on ios  so it seems like a bug,1
mr jamie dimon the gui is nice however the balance shown in my account is far less than desired please erase my credit card balance and add  to my checking account it would help me out a great deal  ill be a client for life,1
i used my iphone app to transfer money from paypal to my bank account and the way it is set up leaves very little to clearly describe and verify what it is that i am requesting until after it is in motion turns out it reversed my request and took money out of my already depleted bank account and put it in limbo for  days being there was still funds in my paypal account i tried again to send it to my bank account and now that too is in limbo for  days so im out several hundred dollars and am now bouncing checks and incurring penalty fees because this app isnt at all concrete about the direction of flow of transfer transactions try to contact them emails and online communications end up with faqs generic help forms and phone calls are met with patronizing reassurances that do absolutely nothing to resolve the issue only confirming that your my money is safe  and truly unavailable for  daysthe operator i finally after two  minute holds and sudden disconnects spoke with admitted there are others complaining about the same phone app problem i love the chase bank just not this app,1
ever since the update on  the app will not update balance or transactions fix this,1
my girlfriend banks with chase i had a chase account years ago but canceled due to the painful security measures they implement in order for my girlfriend to send me rent money i have to open a chase account why i accept and wired money just fine with my usaa account every month i have to log into chase and accept the money she sends me it also will not remember my iphone so i have to request a new verification code each time this is ridiculous i hate chase,1
worked fine before and used this app regularly since update i cant deposit checks from the app crashes as im trying to take the pic using iphone  ios  with no plans to upgrade,1
the new update wont let me login it kept on saying it doesnt recognize this device i requested the code to text to me but i never receive the text now everytime i try to login it asks me for that so pretty much stuck cant login,1
the last release downloaded and installed then nothing happens cannot get the app to open no way to contact support no one listens no one cares thanx chase time to change banks especially bad is the profound lack of support this app has been dead in the water for weeks and they cant even tell wheres big brother when you want him  ios,1
when i transfer funds from one account to another i get the try again later message but the transfer eventually goes through i ended up with duplicate transfers which i had to back outupdate now it doesnt accept my deposits so they go to my wells fargo account their app works great,1
on the iphone  and ios  mobile deposit is broken keep getting errors saying the picture isnt clear enough the app works fine on the iphone s under ios  but now its beyond broken,1
every time i try to log in it says my device is not recognized i have to do a confirmation code whenever i want to log in,1
since updating to ios the quick deposit always says the picture is not clear take the same picture with ios device check deposits,1
i use a password manager and long random passwords  your app disallows pasting on the identification code screen password field i need to be able to paste my password as copied from my password manager  because that field has paste disabled i cant log in and the app is essentially useless,1
would be nice to access chase using finger print rather than entering code,1
though the app has been very helpful in the past the current version using ios  on a s is not working correctly when trying to use the remote deposit feature as the use and retake button is nonfunctioning please correct otherwise the app is working fine but maybe a little slower than with ios ,1
chase feels the need to update this app almost every week it was pretty decent and has gotten worse with almost every update it seems like every fn time i try to use the app i have to download another crappy update just stop if it is something worthwhile then wait till you have a few updates worth downloading and then do it it happened so often in the last year that i was unable to use it at times because i didnt have much room on my phone and every time i made room it filled up the very next time i used your app because there was always a new version find something that works and stick with it,1
does chase not know how to test apps upgraded my iphone  to the new ios and upgraded the chase app and now i cant deposit checks i could no problem do it in ios ,1
why all the  stars,1
i liked this app until the most recent update it broke the deposit check function for those of us on iphone  devices you can still take pictures of the check but the use button and retake button do not function at all i am guessing that is because the developers changed the app for larger screen devices can you change the code so the app still works on the older devices too,1
please please  please fix the check deposit feature for the iphone s  remove the bug out of the last update amp send it out again so we can carry on  i too live out in the sticks amp dont go to town except once per month  this is a real  inconvenience,1
cant deposit checkscant deposit checkscant deposit checks,1
woulnt let me login tolde me i had to use my pc to login because it didnt recognize me even though i put in code told me it wont display information,1
please fix the quick deposit its the best part of the app some of us depend on that im  minutes from the nearest deposit locationnow ive been hit with  in overdraft feesfix the problem return the fees apologizethanks ,1
check deposit no longer worksplease fix,1
this app used to work great now you cant do mobile deposits the use button wont work i tried everything people here in other reviews say same what the famp can someone read tree reviews and fix it,1
everything worked fine until your last change and update not able to make deposits as it will not accept the use photo and keeps zooming in on the check no way for support and waited for the next bug to get fixed now i need to take time off work to deposit my check thanks chase you have not made life easy for me update for  patch still did not fix the issue,1
downloaded the app and added card got a code went to enter it had to go back to verify and it was gone mobile app support cant help should have a way to re access code,1
the chorus of complaints about the camera part of check deposit process not working will chase say be fixed in the  app update,1
as others reported my quick deposit stopped working since i got ios  on my s  when i take a photo the use button doesnt do anything called chase online banking support  level  support wouldnt confirm its a known issue  spoke with a senior service specialist when i asked for a supervisor  this level  rep confirmed its affecting all iphone  amp s on ios   chase is working with apple dev  last ios patch  was supposed to fix didnt  next ios patch is early dec  they say it should fix  well see,1
if you are trying to use quick deposit and the use or retake button is not working call this numbed and complain  this is the mobile banking support,1
is anyone else having a problem with your iphone  not remembering your devise every time you log in  i have to ask for a code everyday because it says it doesnt recognize me im not sure how to fix this,1
one of my most frequently used apps yet also the biggest pain in the butt to log in to  on a side note the previous version with tab bar was much more functional ditch the side navigation please,1
the latest update  is awesome it includes a feature when granted permission by the user to quick access your accounts without signing in ive used it several times already and will continue tonice addish chase,1
the last update is nothing but crap the new feature where you slide the home screen to the right and it will give you your balances those numbers are not correct what you see on the screen when you slide it to the right include pending transactions so if you have recently deposited a check it will reflect a deposit that may not be available to you  this happened to me and i almost overdrew my account because it shows pending instead of true available funds,1
called and waited  minutes to talk to someone at that point they hung up on me before i was able to talk to someone i deposited  and the atm wouldnt let me take any of it back out within minutes of depositing it the reason is that they were updating their system so basically they have money with no way of getting it until they fix their issues terrible customer service cant change routing number if the app thinks it has the correct one i have yet to be able to get the deposit by phone to work and ive tried with a few different types of checks too ridge with what can be entered,1
since the last update chase cannot recognize my phone even after multiple logins i now have to request a verification code every time i try to login  mobile deposits still spotty  cant adjust alerts,1
i dont like to see the little red alert number that indicates how many texts or messages you have in an app chase doesnt remove the alert if youve already seen the message and its impossible to delete them so i always have  missed messages alerting me on my iphone i cant tell if i ever actually have a new message unless i consciously remember how many i had yesterday its incredibly infuriating im probably over reacting but its really pissing me off,1
the box where you enter your username and password disappeared o_o worked perfect for the past two years until this morning,1
this app allows you to do basic functions i would really just suggest that they cover part of your username if you are using the remember me function so that if you are out in public if someone is watching you type your password they dont get all your account info the amex app does this and makes me feel much more secure using it in public,1
it has been  year since i start using this appthis is the best bank app that i likeit time out and log you off if you are not activewhich is awesome for security reasons,1
very disappointed asked to update my app to newest version because i dont have ios it keeps telling me in order to use the app i must update the software can no longer access my accounts via my phone very frustrating situation if previous iphones are no longer supported just say so dont drive us crazy,1
keeps crashing with the new updatei had the older versionhad no problems with this new onewont even let me see my account unless i update in which i did  fn times,1
im still using ios  and dont plan to update so how do u expect me to use chase app please fix the issue thats really bad ,1
i used to love this app and have been using it for about  years it just would not let me log on today since i have ios  on my old iphone s and it needs to be updated in order to use the app although it worked seamlessly yesterday ios  update caused my brothers iphone s to lag a lot so updating is not an option bummer ,1
i am very unsatisfied with how this app turned out i used to appreciate the chase app it was easy to access my account and see my activity but it is stupid that every time there is an update you have to upgrade it or it wont let you use the app ok that was annoying but not to horrible until now some of us still have an old phone some of us cant afford a shiny new iphone so we can have ios  and now because of your mandatory update which requires ios  i cant access my account  so i guess i am deleting your app and going back to text notifications thanks a lot,1
i dont have the memory on my phone to upgrade to ios  and now i cant use the app because it says i have to dl the latest version but when i try it says the latest version is only able to operate on ios  thanks chase will be looking for a different card company,1
i havent updated my phones operating system as my phone is only optimized for ios  the newest update requires ios  and the old version wont allow me to log in anymore sad dayit used to be so convenient,1
forces an upgrade to ios  what if i dont like ios ,1
i am very disappointed i have been using this app for months and all of a sudden the app stops working because it says it needs an update however i tried to update the app but it was unable to download because it requires ios  i do not have ios  and do not want it either would like to be able to use the app again please change to be able to use with ios ,1
needs ios or higher to use,1
cant even use this app anymore because you require ios or later to get the next update and without it its useless due to my phones small storage space,1
im still using ios because ive heard all about how poorly ios runs on an iphone  recently i went to check my chase account and the app tells me i have to update to continue using it i try to update and it says the latest update is only for ios users it wont let me update the app unless i update the os as well what a bunch of bs i called customer support and they gave me the same bs not everyone can afford the latest phone every two years especially with the ridiculous number of updates both the phones and the software makes maybe its time to switch banks,1
i dont want to update my phone just to have chasemy phone do not support update does that mean i dont hv mobile banking or everytime chase update app i have to update phone or buy new one so rediculios,1
never updated my phone to ios  chase required me to update to their newest version so i did   then i was shown my phone must have minimum of ios  and it doesnt so now i have zero access to my bank accounts no warning or optionsthanks chase,1
go ahead and delete it i know i will,1
there are still some of us out there that like ios better looking icons ios runs slower the latest chase update just cut me off from mobile banking now only ios or higher  thanks it professionalslooks like ill need to switch banks to one that supports all ios,1
generally i like the app  stable easy to use intuitive or better to say liked because with the latest update chase prohibited me to use it only because i have ios  on my phone i do not want to upgrade to ios  or   the app asks to update itunes says no and offers me to download an older version and after i download the older version the app would not connect me to my account and ask to update which i again cannot do because itunes wont let download a newer version it is a circle i do not know how to deposit checks any more,1
i have the s iphone and cannot update to the ios my phone is ios i can no longer use online banking to deposit checks directly to my accountnow i must go to the branch to do all my deposits and transactionshow frustrating why did you eliminate those of us who have the older version operating systems that worked great from being able to continue to use online banking services bad business maybe now i will take my business elsewhere,1
must update to ios  to continue using this app well i have an old iphone that only updates to ios  loved the app but now i cant use it because of the update,1
after using this app for some time and most recently making a deposit on  i was required to upgrade the app now requires ios  why do companies continue to force upgrade and then make the app unavailable to existing users i am now forced to find another bank or upgrade to ios  which may or may not run well on my devise since apple will not allow me to use ios  and ios  does not seem that stable i guess i will be finding a new bank and uninstall the app which has continued to become worse with each forced upgrade,1
i have an iphone  ios  runs poorly on it so like most iphone  users  i run ios  so with the latest update i can no longer use my phone to take care of my banking because it requires i update my ios im not buying a new phone every time a lazy developer wants me too mine works fine ill find a new bank instead,1
so i cant use this app anymore was working perfect til suddenly one day it says theres a latest version of it i go to download and it tells me i can only download an older version and requires ios which is clearly unattainable on my ipod touch th generation so legit fix this issue i cant see how much money i have _,1
i would give  stars if the app implements pin code to access the account instead of logging in all the time which is tedious i get that there is the account preview option but whenever i access my account it should as fast as possible since other people might be peeking at my phone,1
i am a senior citizen and have enjoyed banking on my phone for years  your new update requires ios  my phone is a g and wont update to a  and i cannot afford the hundreds of dollars for a new one i have lost my ability to  bank online  so i guess your bank is for the rich  ,1
it says thatbi need the latest versionbut the version runs only on ios  or higher and i can down load ios so i am screwed either way,1
whoever  wrote this update needs to understand not everyone wants to upgrade to the latest ios i maintain ios on this phone for a reason so in order to get back into mobile banking i must upgrade my phone to ios  just so i can load their app which keeps changing every few weeks quit upgrading your app needlessly,1
why it force me to upgrade in order to use the app and why it requires ios  id love to use ios  why dont you consider customer like us,1
i have an older ipod touch that was only able to update to the ios  so any app that requires ios  or higher i cannot download the chase mobile app was great until the latest update and now requires ios  so i cant update it but they also wont let me log in at all without the update so this app is now pointless for me to have if i cant even log in it was fine until the update deleting app now,1
been using this app since it was established yesterday i no longer can open due to older version no longer opens up app i have updated amp installed version available but still cant get into my account bummer,1
so i like this app but im annoyed that even after updating it wont let me access the app  whats even more annoying is that even after updating it says that the version is for ios  or whatever  i havent updated cause i like how my phone is now but its annoying that i cant access the app at all cause its still saying i need to update  chase or itunes freaking fix this crap cause this is annoying,1
after today jan   app has become unusable it keeps requesting an update in an endless loop i am not planning to change to ios or  but now it does not let me use it and after downloading several times what it claims it is the least compatible app it continues looping what a shame you have condemned a great number of your customers to the the dark ages of banking by not allowing a choice zero stars unless you fix this quickly ill do my banking now with regions since their app works fine chase you have mediocre developersthey are costing you customersread the latest reviewsif you care at all,1
hey i used my chase app all the time and now suddenly my app doesnt work because i refuse to update my phone to ios   rude,1
its so sad that this app is not supporting the ios  devices i am trying to use this app is not working with me every time i try to log on to my account it askes me to update to the latest version which only support ios please please please fix this problem,1
i have been using chase bank app everyday for years and now i cant use it anymore because i have ios  and i dont have the room for ios  in my phone to download it i would really like for it to be compatible again for ios  please,1
i am not happy with this application because i can no longer use it due to te fact that i dont have ios  i have the ipod th generation so i cannot get it and check my account i am very disappointed,1
now i cant look at my bank account at all due to the recent update because i have the iphone  which does not have ios  now i have to delete manage my bank account manually,1
i have an iphone gs that i refuse to upgrade for a  or  it just works great for what i need it for now chase app says i need the latest version to access my account or even log in so i go to the app store and the later version requires ios  my phone can o lu get up to ios  the it gives me the option to download the latest version compatible with my iphone gs and still cant log in this needs to be fixed,1
when you try to log in your chase account the app makes you update  when you update it tells you to update again in an infinite loop  basically the app wont work for iphone s user  ios  and  is not designed for s,1
why do i need ios  all of a sudden shouldve kept it ios  compatible now i cant use the app without updating my ios which im not doing,1
this app requires ios  to update so now i cant check my balance one my phone great,1
bs bs bs i have an iphone  and still running os  i refuse to update my os because of all the crap and bugs that accompany these upgrades unfortunately app developers dont care and still regurgitate apps that wont run or wont run properly on new oss and leave the os  users out in the cold this app is one of them f u chase,1
i guess if your phone cant download more recent software tough luck  cant even access the app anymore,1
i have an iphone  with ios  ill be upgrading my phone by the end of the year and do not want to update to ios  yet i use this app almost daily and now i cant use it unless i download ios  why this is a huge inconvenience,1
unbelievable that ive used this app for years and now can not because i dont have apples latest software i only have a g iphone so memory is scarce now i will have to delete so much of my phones content to be able to download the latest memory sucking software and learn a whole new operating system just to be able to deposit a check so disappointed,1
i have been using app for years and it has been great which i used every daytill now it is time to update i still have iphone  with ios  which i love so the new update is useless to me and have no way to do my banking via the app updating things doesnt always make things better,1
no longer supported for ios  or less,1
app forces you to upgrade to latest version only latest version needs at least ios  since im running an older iphone on ios  app in now dead,1
so i tried to log in but find that i need to upgrade not a big deal but then it tells me i need to upgrade to ios  thing is im using an ipod touch th gen which only goes to ios  so not happy i got the app initially so i wouldnt have to turn my computer on every time i wanted to check my balances this needs to change to allow those of us with older ios devices to still use the app unless chase wants to give me the money to buy a newer ipod touch so i can use their app,1
where is the service here i didnt update to ios because of too many people having problems now i dont have enough memory on my phone to update and chase app requires you to run ios or later thanks for looking out for your customers,1
all of a sudden i was unable to use the chase app the message prompted me to update to the latest app fine no problem i was trying to update it to the most recent chase app but i get a message that i need to update my whole operating system to ios i do not want to do that since i like my iosthis is bullying,1
chase continues make this app worse with every updatenow in their infinite stupidity you require ios  this app is basically a glorified web page there is nothing that requires ios  functionality when the previous versions worked on ios  ios  and ios they need to hire a real programmer who understand customer experience,1
the forced upgrade has made it impossible to use my app altogether just because i dont have an ios doesnt mean i dont want to look up my bank info so thanks for excluding me from convenience,1
its not too great when my iphone  will not update to ios  because i have too much music on my itunes so now the only way i can update my chase app is to have ios  i should be able to have an option to keep my same version my ending result is too delete all my music off my phone so i can check my balances every day i depend so much in this app i shouldnt have to be forced to update this app and operating system,1
chase app would not work unless updatedmy ipod touch is an older version therefore the chase app would not update time to delete app it was nice while it lasted,1
this app was great but today i cant access it because it wants me to update and wont let me use unless i update i dont have ios or enough memory in my phone to update the software so now im just out of luck,1
i never updated by iphone  to the ios  system because it takes  of my g in space also we had phones with the upgrade at my work and i hated the format i liked that i could use this app with the ios  system this app is now useless to me and it looks like i will need to delete as it has no compatibility with ios  now so sick of the iphonecant wait for my new phone,1
ive used this app for a long time in my ipod touch nd gen i just opened the app and it wont run without updating to the latest version i try to update new version wont run unless i install ios my ipod wont run ios the final straw changing banks,1
itll say i have like  left and i go buy something then itll say i have like  after  now im  because of this app im out raged,1
newest update requires ios  but my phone cannot update to the operating system  if i want to use the chase app i have to buy a new phone seems kind of silly,1
i loved this app until today i just tried to use it and i cant get in because there is a new update an update that requires ios  i have a iphone  will not update it to ios  and i really dont have a desire to get a new phone right now it is ridiculous that i cannot use the app without updating,1
the app just became worthless to me requires an update for an operating system i cant load without deleting most of the things on my phone i most enjoy because of the rewards this card offers i use this card for gas and amazon purchases but without smartphone access i am switching to another credit card i need quick access to the card i use regularly for monthly purchases and other cards have other rewardsi want smartphone access that doesnt require a smartphone purchase you greedy dweebs youre losing all my business with this app update because im just too lazy to get online i have no desire to spend more time on my computer,1
you would think that one of the largest banks on the face of the earth would have the time and resources to create a decent app you would think wrong on the occasions that this app will even work at all it constantly locks you out requiring you to obtain an identification code before logging in from scratch you cant do much with this app other than pay your bill and even that is laborious makes me want to cut my chase credit card into tiny pieces and sprinkle them on my floor,1
i had this app installed on my ipod touch and it was working fine for a long time suddenly the app says i have to update it to continue using it but the update says it requires ios   and apple isnt providing that version for my ipod  too bad  wish the developers would allow us users of older hardware to continue w this app,1
been using this app for years then all of a sudden they are forcing the update to ios  well judging from past experiences bad things happen to my devices when i update my apple products and i figure what doesnt need fixing should be left alone apple shouldnt be writing software and should stick to devices this app is dead to me,1
thanks a lot for making it a requirement to download the latest appalways and now on top of that requiring  or later i use my ipod touch and refuse to buy a new ugly bigger touch now i guess i cant use chase bank app worthless,1
im trying to update this app and it says i need ios  to continue i hate ios  and i wont be updating but the app wont let me continue using it until i update clearly chase is trying to make their app as unfriendly as possible wells fargos app is way better,1
i liked the app easy to sign in user friendly convenient sure could use a little improvement but then all of a sudden i cant use it anymore because i havent upgraded to ios  so disappointedespecially since i didnt see it coming wouldve given it at least a ,0
i had chase mobile app working for a long time  then i try to log in and app tells me i must download latest app  but now chase app says i cannot download unless i have ios  i am not going to buy new hardware for the chase mobile app  chase dont do this to your customers  pull out the rug and force them to buy new hardware for your software apps  thanks,1
ios  is required anything below is no longer supported ,1
this app is so annoying they constantly force upgrades now unless i upgrade my phone to ios  i cant have chase app anymore i hate ios and will stick with my old os as long as possible argh why cant anyone ever leave well enough alone its exhausting,0
because of this version i cannot use my app anymore it works only on ios which i dont want to downloadchase just deprived me from mobile banking which i used to like,1
use to be a decent app but now i cant even log in without the new update that requires having ios,1
with an ipod touch th gen i can no longer use the chase app which insists on an update based on ios and im not investing in any new ipod touch either ill be deleting the app bummer  it was working ok enough until now,1
not everybody has the latest phone and or operating software latest update requires ios  which would slow my phone down too much the previous chase app should still be able to be used by those with older phones  software,0
this app was great for most deposits quick pays to my kids etc but now its nonfunctional because i choose not to upgrade my iphone s to ios  too bad,1
it wont let me download the updated chase app since i have an older generation iphone that isnt compatible with ios   i do the majority of my banking via my phone that wont be happening anymore because i cannot even open the app chase allow the older version to remain usable for people like me who will continue to bank on our phones even if it isnt with you,1
i use iphone s ios   but i dont want to install ios   if ios  could be avalable  i got it because it makes work with phone too slowly how to be if i want to use this app whit my ios  thank you,1
i have an ipod touch  it cannot be updated to ios    but the new version of chases app requires ios    if i try to run my current app it will no longer run i only get a message saying i must update to the new version  which i cannot dothanks so much chase for deciding to dump ipod users    my ipod works fine with all other apps i need including my other bank  you could at least fix it where the prior version of your app is still usable   if i miss out on some new features oh well   but at least let me continue to access my accounts,1
the home screen keeps disappearing when i try to enter my username and password i have to close the entire app and reload to get the screen back this was never a problem before this new upgrade uugghh,1
i have an iphone  i cant get ios  now i cant use this application my local chase closed and i was depositing my checks through the app now i have to drive  minutes to deposit my check thanks a lot,0
some of us still use hardware that cant be updated to ios   insisting that we have the newest version of your app when the previous version was working fine and then making that newer version require an update that cant be installed is irksome,1
why is it not recognizing my device for the umpteenth time and is always asking for the identification code and it takes forever to get to the email frustration is an understatement,1
no touch idno pin codeno profile vieweditbasically this app does nothing other than let you edit alerts and check balanceits  apps should do more look at discovers app,1
this is horrible and will i probably transfer out of chase   i have certain reasons not to upgrade my ipad to ios     or whatever new one comes along so this will end my banking relationship,1
were talking about a company with nearly unlimited resources  it would seem this would be a stateoftheart app firstly its not updated for iphone  or  plus so everything is zoomed in apparently this screen incompatibility also prevents an iphone  user from using the new sideswipe balance check feature or at least i cant figure out how to use it since upgrading my phonethirdly of all the apps on my phone i cant think of one that would benefit more from using touch id im using my thumb to log in to my amazon app and password  yet to do my banking im still entering a passcode  and one that has to be so long and ridiculous because it accesses such incredibly sensitive information third party touch id extensibility has been available for five months now chase this lessthangreat app lowers my confidence in the company as a whole,1
while i appreciate the importance of security in a banking app i do not appreciate being forced to update my os i really dislike ios  but i doubt ill find a place to review it even if i look,1
username and password fields fall off of screen sometimes you cant log in when it does,1
i was using the app until this upgrade came along  which forces the people to have ios i am still on ios for a solid reason and why are individual apps like this forcing people like me to upgrade the os on my cell phone people who design an app or an upgrade should design it with backward compatibility ridiculous what happened to the professionalism in app design and support well now i cant use this app  unless the company decides to allow running of the previous version or modify this update with compatibility i still cant digest it,1
every time i use this stupid freaking app i have to download an update its ridiculous,1
i downloaded this despite all the bad reviews in hopes that it would ease my ability to review and pay my credit card bill unfortunately i was wrongif you only use chase for credit cards when you sign in you gettotal balance this is a dollar amount alone with no noticeable ability to see account activitypay bill this takes your information youve saved into your account already via the website and lets you pay your billthats pretty much it why i have a problem with this when i see a dollar amount to be paid i want to be able to easily review all my past transactions especially those since the last payment but even those since the last statement would be an improvement in this appto be able to pay my bill with this helpful app in my arsenal of banking tools i had to log in to the app have chase text me an authorization code because it didnt recognize me via the app a good safety feature but timeconsuming really log into the app poke around the app for  minutes trying to find account detail exit the app open browser window log into chase website review account activity via browser sign out of chasecom reaccess the app pay billwhat i completed in  steps could have been achieved in  which is why i rate this app with low usability and give it  stars ill upgrade my review to  or more if it adds even basic features such as account settings not just app settings,1
requires ios  my ipod touch will not take  so i can no longer usei loved it until they updated it so i have to spend  to get an ipod that can run it  booooooo,1
not happy that u obsoleted my ipod touch by requiring ios ,1
while i was able to use it it was great by far the best banking app i have wells fargo as well and its definitely better than theirs the reason im giving it  stars instead of  is because for over a month now the app keeps crashing on me ive deleted and re download it ive restarted my phone and rebooted my phone but it keep crashing right after i enter my username and password chase please fix this so i can use youre awesome features and write a  star review,1
just tried to login last night and got slapped in the face that i need to upgrade to a newer versionbut the new version requires ios which i cannot upgrade to it was working just fine for a long time  but now i cant even login because someone is lazy and doesnt want to support older devicesyou should adjust to your customers instead of forcing them to adjust to you,1
app never sends confirmation code i tried all the available options with no luck had to call support and be put on hold please fix,0
please make it available for ios it requires ios just for the graphics the core part if this app needs nothing please have it back on ios ,0
how crappy to not be backwards compatible        not all apple devices can update to ios   not every one can afford the latest greatest devices  you should allow me to use and downloaded versions that work on ios ,1
my iphone is almost  years amp i must upgrade my phone to at least an ios  in order to access amp use my iphone on chases new app ive been told atampt that i need to get a newer phone something more than the g i have in order to download chases app  well phones are expensive amp i think that should have been taken into consideration im in my s amp im sure i am not the only one that has this issue my phone works fine otherwise i amp others are not happy that we cannot have the convince of access to our bank accounts because we cant afford a new phone i have four or five accounts amp one business account at this moment but i am seriously thinking of doing some shopping around sincerely,1
at a basic level the app does an adequate job of banking the interface is serviceable and my accounts display clearly i would like the app more if the alerts were better designed however the push notifications take up the entire screen there should be an easier way to dismiss the red number icon apart from entering in the app clicking on alerts and then having the icon dismissed make an option so there is a push notification for account status at a selected time instead of midnight say pm convenience pleaselastly touch id if youre going to save my username at least include this optionchase is a passable app but with some flair it can be amazing,1
basic app really needs updating add touchid amax and amazon have it,1
i was using this app for years and then they allowed an upgrade to install on my ios iphone that requires ios now it doesnt work nice goingthey dont even give you an option to roll back the update or redownload a compatible version what a bunch of crap,1
this app has become extremely glitchy and given me two near heart attacks when it said my account was suspended for no reason had to call techsupport and explain my situation to three people once it was reinstated it no longer gives me my account history only the totals in each account which is next to useless i have to go on my computer to see the historybring back the old functionality,1
the app was updated today  and the camera for quick deposits actually works properly hooray  other than the camera issue the app was perfect and now its perfect againon a side note it may be pride on the part of chases it staff not to mention that the camera bug is fixed in this release but i feel thats a cop out  own it and own the fix  youll be more respected for it,1
please add touch id support most major apps support it for example mint american express amazon etc,1
why do i have to download the new update just to use the app thats stupid i dont like being forced into doing anything,1
is there an older version availablei have an ipod and it has a way older version of the app so when i try to use it it tells me to update it when i try to update it i get the message that it only supports ios or higher my ipod only goes up to ios  at the moment and i would really like to be able to use this app there should be the option to download an older version that is compatible with my device,1
ive been using this app for some years already and as of late its asking me for a code because it doesnt recognize my deviceso i go thru the process and they email me a code and when i input that and the password after the app either tells me that the user idpassword is incorrect or it crashes  i tried deleting the app and redownloading it and the same thing happens  what gives,1
with the latest update this app has become unusable it crashes after entering the username and password reinstalling and rebooting havent fixed the issue either shame too because the app was very useful when it worked,1
why doesnt this app have have access to touchid,1
i cant access the secure message center i never need those messages anyway but it irks me to have  unread messages also the sidebar menu toggles and that is weird it should be fixed i like paying my cc bill and now being able to input how much  i want to pay,1
app is trying to force me to upgrade to ios which i hate look of and functionality and refuse to do so just changing a a number in one of files in my phone it lets me log on and works fine which says that there is absolutelly  reason for them to force me to update when they can just remove the force requirement for ios this is so illegal ,1
i use it all the time and i love the fact that i dont need to type my password but just use my thumb very useful,1
making use of touch id is nice since i often log in more than once a day but it doesnt work consistently i have two chase accounts and can log into the first one the one registered with touch id without any trouble if i input the username of my second account touch id opens account info for the first one i have not had the opportunity to set up touch id with the second account im not sure if i should be expecting a prompt or if it wasnt planned to be used with multiple account access on the same device,1
i have always like this app it has good features but now since this new update came out  you can use touch id to access your account is awesome i have been waiting for this since touch id came out,1
update   is this a joke touch id to open the app but have to enter a password just to pay the bill seriouslyplease look at the competitors apps and copy them this app is so very limited and convoluted to use first why no touch id for access very very easy to incorporate and adds a level of convenience that your customer deserves sliding to deleteforwarding secure messages is a must the teeny tiny delete icon doesnt even work very easy coding as well navigating the various areas is slow and im on an iphone  i truly feel for the slower phones like i said look at discover citi etc and see whats done right discover is on top of it even a quick look in the notifications drop down very slick,1
professional and convenient,1
very good after u log on a pain to log as is never recognized my iphone or ipad so need to send a code every time not good,1
definitely my favorite banking app and ive used most,1
it does everything i want and more a great recent addition was touch id for logging in,1
since the second to last update i cant even sign into the app everytime i put my password and username in the app closes out on me or requests a verification code that i input and it doesnt work at all and closes the weird thing though i can access the app through my ipad and any other platform but the iphone app just decided to quit working not sure whats going on i thought this last update would fix this but nope,0
great,1
best banking application ever touch pad to signin was another great feature thanks,1
just recently started using my chase account more and im really happy with the service i received so far app is convenient as easy to use as well,1
always the most up to date bank app,1
great app  easy to do,1
i love this appfrom chase its so easy to use,0
update  what was already great just got better with the implementation of touch id awesome works as advertised nice clean interface have no problems with it like the online deposit function,0
useful and very easy to navigate,1
banking at my fingertips less trips to the bank app works  of the time,1
touch id made it x better,1
love using this app wherever i go to check my balance and purchasesupdatetouch id is awesome so its easier than ever,0
i love this app my only complaint is when i changed my number and tried to get alerts through text messages it never set even after the send the identification code i been trying for months no joke  at least they have touch id now so thats cool,0
i use this app every day i have become reliant on it for day to day handling and monitoring of my finances etc forgot to pay a bill no problem i have all my bills set up as payees and i cant pay my bills in a matter of minutesno stamps or envelopes needed perhaps the best part of this app is quick pay child needs money but lives   hrs away i can send it to her in seconds and thats taken care of boom and the best addition came with the last update touch id to log in im in love ,1
works perfectly use this app every single day with no problems at all two thumbs up,0
this app has always been well designed functional easy to use and useful with the addition of touch id i will be using it more often and it will be so much quicker to get in im so glad chase is the bank that amazon uses for their card such a wise choice,0
the app works wellno problems but id like to see one modification saving your usernames an all or nothing choice however if some of it was blocked just a few characters for account recognition would make signing in simple for the owner however if the phone is loststolen that infos hiddenadditionally a single wrong password should clear all the saved username information from the app,0
touchid,0
this app does everything i want it to and has not let me down at all what more can i say besides its an awesome app,0
and when its not its a huge pain in the butt,0
excellent app for online banking ,0
horrible app it ask for a security code almost every day,0
very nice app i use this app for all purposes pay my bills transfer money send money to my daughter and sister if you try you would love it enjoy it have a wonderful daygoodbye,1
it makes my life easier dont have to run to my computer every time i need to check my account,0
i have faced no problems so far the only thing was the notifications would get stuck up inspite of reading them overall its really nice,0
this app has improved a great deal over the years the ios  makeover was greatly needed and still fits within the ios  ecosystem aesthetically some of the most useful features include chase quickpay fingerprint login and quick glances at bank information the chase app is a must for chase customers,0
awesome,1
simple easy and convenient,0
i really love this especially how easy it makes to transfer money through chase quick pay couldnt find anything better ,0
i love this application theyve made so many improvements that make mobile banking really quick and painless my favorite feature is swiping before logging in so you can easily see your account amounts without having to type out your username and password,0
from the easy deposits to the very userfriendly menus this is a great app i really have to go to the bank because i have this app  also end of the day just add the touch id as the login option,0
adding touch id claims certain function dont work with this feature when i asked their technical support if he could give that list i was told no one in chase has a list of what is or isnt supported when i asked him if there is no list how did the chase programmers code the software instead of answering he hung up great customer supporti can give other examples of stupidity with their support but its up to you to tolerate stupidity,0
awesome,0
works great very convienient,0
i dont normally write reviews but app devs love putting in the line of code that asks you to rate them i usually press no thanks and move on but chase has implemented touch id for login and thats worth noting i wish more app devs would follow suit the ui is clean and seamless thanks for a great app,1
app is simple and fast and makes depositing checks transferring money between accounts or to other people so easy keeping an eye on gains and losses of investment account credit card chargesrefunds all so painless with this app chase has become the amazon of online banking,0
amazing,0
this app is great and very convenient im super excited and also impressed at the changes that have been made such as the finger print unlock code to the quick pay amp being able to access your full account from your mobile phone awesome new features ,0
i like that they added touch id,1
i love that i can put checks in my account from my phone so easy and fast i can easily transfer money between accounts and pay my balance on my amazon credit card never had a problem with this app love it,0
very convenient,0
chase never ceases to amaze me with the technologyforward features like quickpay being able to deposit a check from my phone is very convenient this app works well and with the addition of touch id to access my accounts the process is that much easier,1
frankly im impressed that they updated the entire app for ios  iphone  screen size and now touch id which is great to have for this type of app they took the time to do it right,0
easy to access and fonts are large enough easy to go through to each section easy mobil deposits,1
awesome,1
its real time transactions and alerts saved my butt and my money from fees its worth having and better than the other banking apps ive used,0
very handy and super user friendly app,0
the app is greateasy to work with,0
with the addition of fingerprint scanning this app does it right,0
x better than the bank of america app bank itself is x better chase ftw,1
it does what it needs to do because they have billions of moneys,0
awesome,1
it is so helpful to have this app handy on my phone to easily track my spending i recommend it,0
its a good app except that the secure message center feature has stopped working for the past  releasesupdates it used to work before in ios please fix it,0
its all you need to check your balance and make payments plus just snap a photo of your check and send it straight to your account without leaving your house simple and easy to use love it ign ,0
although ive used my ipad numerous times to access chase online it still does not recognize my login and i must authenticate myself via a id code  inconvenient and extends my time when this was supposed to be a quick exercise  overall very mediocre but thats what i expect from chase,0
who needs a check book anymorea really nice appmakes good since user friendly as wellthank you,0
hands down the best app for banking,0
i can do almost everything on the chase app that im able to do on my desktop i can not add a new payee from the app love the swipe to see balance and im looking forward to using touch id to sign in,0
i prefer to have a  digit pin to enter to login each time i also wish that there were itemized bills or more detailed billing to review past purchases i use my amazon chase card and all the bills are titled and categorized the same so its hard to verify the actual products purchased overall the app is okay and helps make mobile payments,0
great app  love the fingerprint authorization versus always typing in my code the quick pay is really nice i never thought i would use it till i started now i love it great app chase,1
great,0
i can do my mortgage and amazon credit card all in  place,0
this app is one of the better mobile apps user friendly,1
i dont have a bad thing to say about this app i love the quick pay i love the mobile deposit and i love that its very userfriendly its also aesthetically pleasing,1
ive had a boa app for my credit card for a while but this app is  times more userfriendly and intuitive + useful,0
its a little hard to get to alerts sometimes because its not well organized but the app pretty much lets me do what i need to so thumbs up,0
wish theyd allow larger chase quick pay amounts,0
love this app makes banking a breeze  deposits inquiries transfers you name it this app does it and im completely satisfied also am glad they finally got the touchid login started as well so i dont always have to put in a username and password  thumbs up chase  keep up the good work,1
love the quick view and the fingerprint log on,0
awesome,1
my phone does not support ios so i cant get the newest update older app responds with temporarily unable to connect please try again later ive tried again hours days and weeks later to no avail when the updated version of this app became available for ios users my older app version stopped opening please maintain functionality of older app versions for users without ios,1
love the feel of this app makes my mobile banking that much more seem less and simple quick and easy,0
its a really great appeasy of use and now with the fingerprint login for iphone devices its even easy and the preview feature does help in not needing to login all the time ,1
i love this app and the set notifications its easy to use and now has other great features like just entering pin code in since i often forget my password ive been with chase since  and im still loving them,0
 mu un  gur m ncnt ,0
the app is great and so easy to use i also like that you can use the touch id now instead of having to type in your password love it keep up the good work chase,0
convenient and secure,0
this new appis lesssimple than than theprevious onehas some helpful featuresbut was better the original ,0
ive used this app for a while now and every time they release an update they make it more functional and easy to useit offers a lot of convenience without compromising security   i used to go to the bank all the time and now i rarely go highly recommend it,0
jumbled username because reasonsanyway a financial institution made a good app someone ring cnngood job,0
works great i have no problems with itits fast easy  and simple,0
what would make it better is to be able to edeposit over  that limit is kind of unrealistic i am sure it is for security just wishing it could be closer to ,1
why must i constantly have to have a code to access it  isnt my password enough,0
one of the best banking apps out there but has some room for improvementmobile check deposit does not auto detect check and take picture like some other banks which creates two more steps take picture and approving it  the technology is out there and id like to see it implemented entering check amount    first there isnt even the option for a comma ex   should have stationary comma amp decimal so the same keystrokes are ex     this is more intuitive and will save time keyboard glitches when turning sideways and stays up preventing used to take a picture that would be solved by  abovechase  youre my main bank because your the best in the biz would like to see a little more on the app although i love the new touchidcheersmodern man,1
awesome,0
works wonderfully,1
this is the second time i have used the app and yet again i needed to be sent an access code is this going to happen every time,1
seamless life integration,0
great,1
touch id keeps switching off   the touch id will work for a few times and the it will turn off for the application i will then have to turn back on   looks like a bug  please look into  been using two days and touchid is ok so far,1
prob the best banking app easy smooth visually appealing and consistent in performance,1
this app is very well designed and easy to use the only thing i wish it had which compares to other apps such as discover is a shorthand way to enter your password for example discover allows you to enter a four digit code or use touch id other than that this app is great and i highly recommend it,1
this app is awesome i really love the account balance preview when i need to quickly check my balance its so  convenient to just right swipe amp get all my balances without having to actually log in the whole app is very user friendly amp takes no time to become accustomed to using i also like that if i want my username stored its right there waiting or for security reasons you can type it in every time you log in also very cool that you have to activate the balance preview feature amp can disable it at any time if youve decided that you dont want to take the risk of possibly losing your phone amp having that information available to anyone who finds your phone  i am a big fan of the easiness of the account transfers as well you can even set up repetitive automatic transfers as well plus the push notifications come in handy  overall i think this latest version is the best yet a must have for all chase customers whether youre tech savvy or not,1
i love love love the chase mobile app it keeps you in full control of your finances providing any information you need at the touch of a buttonit allows me to complete key banking functions securely and without digging in the navigation for the action im looking for plus i can complete those actions anywhere  and within seconds truly puts my accounts in my own hands whenever i want its simple to transfer funds between accounts amp from paypal which is important to me this is one of the many reasons i love banking with chase its easy quick nonobtrusive and simple just the way banking should be ,0
ive used this app for many different transactions easy to navigate amp its saved my butt more than once  ,0
i love the ability to transfer funds and pay my credit cards off with the touch of a button anywhere anytime chase has truly made this app user friendly and efficient one negative or i would have given it  stars the inability to deposit checks in amounts over  is a frustrating would prefer to not have to wait in line at the bank for any basic transactions,1
app is extremely convenient and easy to use,0
its is good and helps save a lot of time i wish i could remote deposit checks at a much higher level i wish i could deposit checks up ,1
i love not having to write out checks love being able to check on my account  i love being able to see all of my statements now,1
the app is much more accommodating than it used to be,0
the app is greathelpful quick pay is great i just downloaded version  and now the app wont open anymore today is ,1
awesome,1
highly recommend ap  banking at your fingertips great for alerts,0
everything you could want from a banking app and more,1
it works period does what its supposed to however one star down for not being multiuser i have to rewrite username and password every time i switch users annoying but thats my only issue not the end of the world,1
amazing,1
have used many banking apps this has been by far user friendly revoked to all great job chase,0
other than the fact that it never remembers my phone and i need a code every time i want to log in its an extremely convenient app,1
useful for depositing checks on your phonesafe secure quick and convenient access to baking informationonly thing i wish they put back is a swipe code instead of having to type in your password every time,1
app works wellthere is no downtime on the performance of the app i like the functionality also,1
right,1
im going to keep this short pretty much this does what you would expect this app to do  its easy to use and i havent had any problems with it for about the year ive been using it so theres my review of this app,0
awesome,1
i like this apphave had this app a few years with no problemsit is fast and very efficient works very well when i need to use it for whatever,0
i love this app  very easy to navigate pay bills make a deposit transfer money  i would rate it  starshowever im very disappointed in features being taken away if you upset chase in anyway  perfect example  i utilize the overdraft protection feature  that means chase pays my checks even if there is no money in my account  i am charged  for insufficient funds and i pay for that service every time  yet if you do it too many times even though you pay for it they remove the make a deposit feature away from the  mobile app  this really does not make sense as the ability to make a deposit easily would assist me in reducing the number of isf fees yet they take that away  i really dont understand that  because on line banking is huge there is much less brick and mortar branches and that makes it harder to get to a bank to make a deposit  stop punishing customers for utilizing the services you offer them,1
i hate i have to always get an identification code when i check from my phone or switch to my pc,0
 issues with the touch id since a recent update it appears to only work part time after entering my fingerprint i still have to enter my password when i dont logout manually and allow it to idle logout in its own the idle logout notification blocks the touch id from being used for user of touch id the idle logout notification needs to be suspended and the touch id prompt should be displayed again instead,1
you wont be disappointed the best feature is when you use a new device to access your account the app stops the process until your identity is verified,1
i recommend the app and the bank to friends now so much better than the old way of banking love it,1
have used exclusively for almost  years but now across three devices and various updates the app stopped working for mobile uploads it says the picture is not clear enough   tech support says they see my pictures and they are plenty clear enough but they are very sorry nothing can be done now i have to drive  mins each way to deposit checks,1
ive used this app for so long on my phone without problems lately ive tried to log in and gotten the we dont recognize this device message almost every time i try to log in i have to have a login code texted ive had the same phone for  years this is ridiculous and very frustrating its a pretty good depiction of how chase treats their customers though ive had nothing but trouble from them over the last year so heres your app review that you prompt me to write almost every time i try to log in chase is the worst definitely do not recommend,1
this app at first glance is super easy to use i just entered my username and password to link a card touch id is a really nice feature and i plan to check out the passkey wish everything was as smooth,1
this app works perfectly and i could t ask for more it feels secure and always accurate,0
i love chase banking app a lotits very convenient and easy to worknever had a problem with itchase always updates and lets me know whats going on with my accountchase is great,1
it is a cinch to maneuver through the app depositing checks online is also simpleonly little thing that irks me is that when i get a notification i have to go into the app to disengage it instead of just deleting it from my notifications the little number on the app will stay and thats not cool,1
i like the appworks well on my iphone s i like the finger print password function,1
good luck changing your password a bank that doesnt accept visa payments overly complex username and passwords making it less secure,1
its so sad that this app is not supporting the ios  devices i am trying to use this app is not working with me every time i try to log on to my account it askes me to update to the latest version which only support ios please please please fix this problem,1
i like the thumb print to sign in addition to my iphone pass code to unlock the phone and dont mind them asking me to reenter my password to enter a transactionpay credit card transfer  the format is pleasing to the eye and very easy to navigate one minor complaint is that the check scanner can be finicky works with typed checks all the time but has the occasional issue with handwritten personal checks no biggie though since i can deposit it at most atms that are every  blocks in nyc not sure what other bank apps are like but this should be the gold standard,1
recently restored my phone and have to get an identification code to verify my account every time i put the code in the app crashes ridiculous,0
excellent i love it so easy to navigate,0
pretty much use this app exclusively for all banking  occasionally ill have to go to chasecom for something but its a great app very useful and easy and ive never run into a problem,0
i just love this app the best feature ever is the ability to access my account by just using my fingerprint it saves me time by not having to type in my username and password and it seems safer for some reason thank you chase bank for having such a great app amp great auto loans amp services i couldnt think of a better bank that i trust more than them keep up the great work kmo,0
i use several other banking and credit card apps and this one is by far the worst i have signed up to use the mobile app and authenticated my phone using the code only to be told i cant use it from my mobile device once i activated touch id it allowed me to sign on but would not let me pay my credit card bill because it says my password is invalid even though its the same password i just used to log into their crappy site which not to mention i have to verify each time if i use a different pc the site doesnt even show anything under the my accounts tab im not an idiot but their site and app make me feel like one due to the overly secure and non user friendly interface i guess ill just have to settle for calling in my payments maybe even cancel my card when its payed off due to massive inconvenience my advice go with discover barclayciti amex or probably anything else all of those above mentioned have a much smoother and user friendly interface save yourself a headache if youre looking for a new credit card,0
awesome,1
 just downloaded chase mobile and im liking it a lot simple to use highly recommended ,0
best app,0
i cant write a dot while trying deposit my checks for example  i should write  then save amount an after delete  because it appears like and write  and save again,0
on every transaction i believe that small amount of code to implement that would benefit all customers in knowing just when they spent said currency i was a fraud victim just today chase did well to notify me and help out but id like to know who i can trust around me and having a time stamp on each transaction would aid in remembering just enough information to to consider being fraud on the consumer end think about it will big guy,0
ive been having problems logging on it says that the log in is temporarily unavailable but its been like that for more than a month i deleted the app and redownloaded itstill didnt work wasnt too upset until my husbands started to do the exact same thing now we both are unable to log in the username and passwords are correct the service is just temporarily unavailable,0
quick deposit crashes when trying to take the second check photo im on an iphone  running ios  and this feature used to work for me also there doesnt appear to be any way to report bugs so hopefully this low review will draw some attention,0
desperately needs apple watch support,0
the most recent update locks you in the app and the only way out is a total reboot everysingletimethis was never a issue beforeplease fix this fast,0
everyone i log in it forgets my phone and they have to send me another code to verify my identity been using the app for years and never had any issues before now,0
i love this app however every time i log in it requires me to get an identification code to gain access this has never happened before and i have not changed devices so it should not be requiring it each time i try and log on please update and fix,1
the app at least x per week sends me a message that it does not recognize my device  i have been using the chase app on my iphone for  years  it is really annoying to always have to enter the long code  also the phone number chase has on record is old and i have called chase to change it x   but it still never takesit is really frustrating dealing this this co  negative stars,1
it takes me less time to drive to the bank and get my balance than to use this app it constantly makes you update close the app reopen update againthe worst hey zillion dollar company im sure the geek squad at best buy could make a better app or better yet hire someone from apple to make you an app and stop trying to save a penny so your ceos can afford one more kilo of blow at their caligula yacht party,0
if you are a chase account holder and want to make  to  overnight no money required serious inquires call or text ,0
i keep receiving a prompt that my device is not recognized and i need an identification code to login i always use the same device and i rarely clear my cache its very annoying having to constantly receive the code through text and enter it at login in order to access my accounts,0
for the past two weeks i have been having to request a new authorization code every time i want to view my account  this happens in a matter of minutes please fix the issue,1
if i have to write a review there must be something wrong i am a true chase bank believer i love them ive been with them for years but i dont know if its the app or the bank that im upset with yes like everyone else im not a fan of the password log in its ios  chase needs to check out the discover card app amazing sleek and just a pin code to access everything you need but this is not my main concern or maybe i never noticed it before but i feel like the transactions arent as fast anymore sometimes it can take up to a week for something to hit my account even cash deposits this has been very frustrating why does it take so long ill have an account availability of so much then the next day im someone overdrawn because a week from the purchase it decides to hit my account cash availability should be a little more accurate  i love chase by please dont let this be a determining factor to leave,0
stopped working after ios no longer recognizes my phone and asks that i put in a confirmation code but force quits when i do i shouldnt have to call your customer service line to report a bug in the app that is a waste of my time and energies,0
with the new ios update i keep having to request a code and log in its hasnt happens to me before,0
the ap keeps asking me for a code because it doesnt recognize my device this is the same device ive had for the past year,0
fingerprint id disappeared,0
touch id doesnt work and is unable to be fixed if you ever in life change your chasecom username or password furthermore its a major hassle to redeem freedom rewards via the app bc youre rerouted to another site you have to enter all security info again and most times youre booted off the site and have to start over again you also cant search for checking transactions by dollar amount type debit or credit or even type of purchase debit card check etc i cant even search via check number check date or check dollar amount im forced to search thru my entire financial history to locate one transaction the entire purpose of an app is to simplify life this app does little to accomplish that chase has a lot of work to do,1
keeps telling me device is not recognized and asks me to get identification code for every login spent an hour with mobile support and per their recommendations deleted and reinstalled the app still same issue,1
im so glad chase has this app its so easy and quick to uses no more typing in a username or password  just press your finger on the home button and your in the best app for mobile banking and for people on the go seti,1
good app i just wish the chase quick pay was able to send with signing in by fingerprint for apple i phone,0
perfect,0
people have to remember this is just an app its not meant to replace what you can do at an actual chase bank or what you can do online through chasecom i mean i feel like this app does exactly what you need it to do i really havent had any issues with it the only thing that would make it like superstar level as if it would actually dispense money lol,0
works great,0
perfect,0
chase app is the best bank app ever i can deposit anywhere and anytimetouch id login is really convenience for me but read alert feature is sometime not properly open,1
i am on my chase app several times each week i can do nearly everything on the app that i can do when i visit the chasecom website on my laptop computer i love this app,1
i use this app for making payments and using award points the app works great for those things making payments is quick and simple i wish they had the code tracing login instead of typing in my password each time,0
one of the reasons i use chase is that all my credit cards amazon  southwest etc  all appear in the app so its very easy to manage all my transactions in one placeive never got the check scanner to work on amounts more than  but that might just be a limitation deliberately set up to prevent fraudall in all though a really great service and in like the way you can set up the system to send you sms alerts for any transaction size  even as small as one centunusual credit card transactions can also be approved or disallowed instantly via sms which is a huge time saver for anybody who has tried to make a large purchase and had to go through the automated phone service of any bankkeep up the good work  looking forward to paying for things with a pin like in europe  also more fingerprint approved transactions would be nice  not just for logins,1
all info sensitive applications should be this easy to log into,0
i have been using this app for a while it never crashes on me and i understand that it asks me for a password always for my own protection i dont understand how some people cry about still asks me for password of course it will what if someone steals your phone or you lose it they crack your code and take your moneythis is not facebook its a  bank account lol keep up the good work with the app,0
this seems like a glaring security flaw why are you still showing my username in plaintext before and during login even though i am using touch id its not necessary as touch id can cover both fields,0
love itthank you so muchfacebookcomperfectsublet no fee furnished rentals is manhattan,0
why are you constantly changing this app find one that works and keep it ive been asked for an access code three times on different devices because you dont recognize it it makes me suspect thumbs down for the last six months,0
if someone happens to get a hold of my device and has my password and information they can get in i know this is easy as most are unlike me and use multiple passwords you need fa via google authenticator andor sms that generates a random code every  seconds for secondary securitysome other banks are doing it why arent you,0
i wish that i could search for an amountexample  and it would pull them all up great for balancing when you added the amount twice,0
this is a very easy to use app i wouldnt change a thing,0
love this ap,0
good good good good,0
works every timegives me the info i need to keep track of my spendinggreat job guys,0
this app is so glitchy it requires a verification code every time i log in because apparently my device isnt recognized this added step has become very repetitive and a quite frankly a waste of my time also sometimes when i log in it gives me an error and says my accounts are not web enabled  when this happens my accounts are unable to be viewed and i have to delete the app entirely and redownload it another added step that becomes very tedious this app is more trouble than its worth do yourself a favor and grab a laptop this app will let you downstep your game up chase,1
no quick login pin or way to save login credentials aside from username cant see full account information that you get from the website like when does my autopay process payment update on my credit score information on how long chase will hold a transaction against your account customer service was even less knowledgeable etc,0
this app is great never lets me down the finger scan feature is awesome only thing id like to see is that i wouldnt need a security code every time i log onto from a different device rather answer a security question instead,0
this worked fine up until the most recent update it worked fine before but ever since the  update the app doesnt remember my device and has to send me an auth code every time i try to use it it normally only does this the very first time you launch it but now for me it does it every time i use the app very inconvenient hippo ie theres a fix soon,0
been pissing me off started off having better features than other bank however lately can never deposit check by picture been terribly slow for sign ons boots me off all the time,1
aleays getting some http status code error popup on mobile deposits,0
can not put  at the username that make me unable to login to my account,0
very easy to usewill save a lot of time for you love it,0
the newest app update keeps turning off my quick view and i keep needing a verification code to log in after i sign out  it is very frustrating  please fix  the older version worked perfectly,0
ever since setting up an amazon rewards credit card i have been surprised how easy it is to work with chase its the great apps like this one that makes you know chase cares about good business i know my card balance at any time its instant and accurate showing me pending charges total credit being used and even when a balance is due setting up a payment is quick and easy i dont have to make any special calls or worry about miscommunication also i can see tue points from my amazon rewards which helps me make wise decisions when it comes to spending money on gifts it may not be a huge return but using this card paired with the chase mobile app is just one way i can better utilize my money to serve others and have the freedom i need with my money hope you all find it just as useful,1
it does what needs to be done,0
it keeps asking me for new identification code every few days and it automatically turns of touch id option and account preview i am using the same phone over a year now,0
easy to use makes managing your finances so much easier than other apps  paying your bills has never been easier thank you chase bank,0
with the new update it no longer remembers me i have to have a code texted to me every time i want to log in i even went to settings and selected for touch id again and it still didnt work im not going to waste my time having a code texted to me every time i want to log in this may cause me to even close my account with them,1
update wiped out credentials reset of login was a pain in the se lags behind the competition by a long mile,0
this app has always been great up until i updated it to the most recent version every time i open the app is says it does not recognize my phone and ask for an identification code i have done this process over three times already amp it still continues to say the exact same thing every time i open the app please fix this issue,0
very good appvery easy to usechase mobile is the for me  thanks,0
good job,1
ever since the new update the app doesnt remember my device every time i go to lin in with touch id it says i need to turn it back on in settings then after i enter my password i have to enter in an access code and the password again because it doesnt recognize my device ive deleted and downloaded the app and still have the same issues i have the app for convenience and this is very inconvenient,0
i am writing this review probably the rd time  i am still seing blank messages in secure message centerit is not a good user exp to see a blank screenalso in between i saw we are sorry error message and then on going to secure message center i was seing the transfer screen i think u need to recheck the message centerfix it or remove it,0
chase closed my account because someone did a fraud activities on my account and said i cant be with them even when im dead thats crazy,1
and touchid is disabled when i logout,0
my device is never recognized so every time i log in i have to request a verification code to be sent to my email then wait for the email log in again with the code then i get access every single time why once i log in on a device it should remember and not ask me to reverify i dont have time for that,0
for ages ive used the mobile app on my phone but ever since one of the last two updates i now have to request an identification code every single time i want to sign in even if its sec after i just signed out im not clearing any information on my phone so i know its an issue with the app,0
great appvery helpful and convenient,1
new update keeps signing me out and making me have to log in with a new access code please fix,0
the app is great lets me do exactly what i need but for the past  weeks every time i log on i am asked for a verification code as if i have never used this app on this phone before and i have been now for over two years please fix that and all will be well,0
since the latest update every time i open the app its telling me it doesnt recognize my mobile device and i must have a code texted to me  to the number of my mobile device thats already in the app so why doesnt it recognize it these extra steps are annoying please fix,0
your latest update does not function properly with the touch id i keep having to request a code to access app as it tells me that it does not recognize the device,0
this app is almost perfect and if i could access a nonmobile chasecom website from my phone or tablet i wouldnt even be complaining but i cant and without the ability to access a nonmobile chasecom site from a phone or tablet i cant access my rewards from my credit card and i dont always have access to a computer so i would like to see that made available for mobile devices,0
almost every time i log on it keeps saying it doesnt recognize my device it has asked me to put in an identification code over  times now on the same phone,1
i dont know what happened to this amazing app but now every time i open it it says it doesnt recognize my mobile device iphone s+ i have to request for a code via text message to log in this is so frustrating every time i close the app and re open i have to request another code to be able to log back in,1
after latest update touch id turns off automatically on my iphone and when i try to log back in using my password it constantly says it does not recognize my device and i must receive an email to get a confirmation code to login i wish there was a simple way to report bugs but maybe someone will see it here and provide an update fix,0
the only thing i can see being upgraded is the extra points you get when shopping through chasecom a lot of people make purchases from online stores on their phones not a huge deal and other than that it is very seamless and smooth running thanks chase,1
good job to the chase team for improving their app since its creation runs very smoothly and secureplenty of options to manage your account it is like having a personal banker in the palm of your hand ive had the app on my lg gamp and now my iphone + as of yet it has not crashed since having my iphone i work with an airline company so i am constantly on the go but i have no worries about my chase account strongly advise chase account holders to download,0
i really like the app it makes banking so easy i really dont need to go on my computer to handle any banking love every update make my life a lot easier the only fix i would like to see is when i use the finger print code to log on i wish it would let me transfer funds without having to put in my password,0
very user friendly app the touch id is a nice feature as well,0
a very dependable apps for online banking i likelove this appsinfinite thumps up,0
once i updated my iphone  the app started to crash constantly asking to redo my fingerprint to sign into the app cant even look at the way preview andddd constantly asking to request a code to log in annoying,0
i swear to god if this app says one more time that we dont recognize this device please send us a verification code this is the same device ive always used and im siiiick and tired of constantly having to verify it sometimes i have to reverify back to back if i decide to login again shortly after the first time fix nowww,1
app doesnt work keeps saying doesnt recognize my device and have to ask for a code everything i try to log in,1
since the new update chase no longer recognizes my mobile device so i have to sign in with a identification code fix this,0
why doesnt this app send emails ive been trying to reset my password and thats my preferred method they offer that feature as an option and the app states that its been sent but i never receive it now i either have to call up support and yell at someone or walk into a chain and do so stupid and unnecessary bug fix itupdate so the email issue is still the same only now i just have the code called by phone the only other annoyances are the dropdown alerts menu and the security password menu a pattern lock option would make access a little quicker and more comfortable,0
loved this app before i upgraded to ios  now touch id wont work it makes me get a code texted to me to have access to my account then i can change settings to turn touch id on problem is as soon as i log out it turns it off please fix touch id,1
the chase app does not recognize my device anymore no matter how many times i verify it it turns off touch id and i keep needing a code to get in not pleased,1
i love using my chase app it is so easy to deposit a check to send it never having to go to the bank  the only upgrade i would love is of somehow we could deposit cash and we would never have to go to the bank but i know thats not realistic love the app,0
excellent tool,0
its a great app however over the last few weeks on my company cell iphone and my personal samsung s edge it constantly acts as if its my first time signing in and wants an authentication code which requires an annoying process of a text or email reset ive spoken with chase in regards to this and they claim its a known issue but sounds like no eta my software is up to date and so is my app so no idea why it keeps doing this on both operating systems,0
it keeps saying that it doesnt recognize my device and i had to put a identification code each time i logged in with the app happened  times in a row and its the only device i use please fix this,0
this app is smooth and reliable,0
i am happy that chase is so protective of my account but do i really need to verify my phone every time i log in and what happened to quick view and logging in with my thumb chase said to approve the fingerprint id in my settings but it is approved this app is being funky and they need to update and fix it you can do plenty with the app but logging in is a real pain,0
ever since i downloaded the update the app wont remember my iphone i have to request a code each and every time i need to login ughhh please fix this thanks,0
lately this app stopped working it doesnt recognize my phone and every time i have to request a code as soon as i lose internet connection in the last  minutes i had to request  verification codes just to complete on transaction get this fixed,0
ever since the upgrade every time i try to log on it says it does not recognize my mobile it is frustrating that every time  i want to log on i have to request security code n also i turn on quick preview n touch id n it turns off itself after i log out please fix this issue ugh,1
while im using the same device my phone this app does not recognize my device and ask for an identification code for at least four times every time i typed in the code it would work for a few days and then again it asked for the code is this normal if so its very annoying and it does not happen even once for my other banking appsmeanwhile it keeps asking me to turn on touch id in the app settings otherwise i have to type in the password i did it he first day i installed this app why do i have to do it again and again i just cant understand the logic here,0
since your new update i have to keep requesting a code because it doesnt recognize my computer very frustrating please fix i use your app everyday love it until you undated it,0
having the same issue again every time i log in with my password it says it doesnt recognize the device and i have to do the identification code to log in ive done this  times in the last day on the same device please fix this,0
you can do almost everything with it very convenient and practicalmust have app,0
love the new version now i have to put a pass code and only use my print finger great job,1
sometimes it works and its great  more often and i downloaded the new version it logs on once or twice with touch then afterwards i try and it says it doesnt recognize the device wants to send me a code  way too often to even use anymore  weird because my amex app does it perfectly every time i guess with chase i get to do my banking on the desktop,0
i still have an iphone  and this update makes it impossible to use the app without getting the authorization code every time the description says that the app should work with os but that is only true if your phone is s or newer,1
this last update killed this app for me every time i log in it sees my phone as a new device and wants a verification code wth fix please,0
i love chase and i love their newly designed app but on my new iphone s plus running ios  every time i login it doesnt recognize my device and i have to authenticate with a code every single time already tried reinstalling but that didnt help hope they can fix this,0
forces me to request an id code every time i log in because it says that it doesnt recognize my device,0
si pudiera darle  stars se la dariaesta app es increible,1
no problem using the chase appso far its been a year since i purchased my iphone and using the chase app never crashed and always good to have no problems for me  stars sure,0
i dont know what they did on there recent update but it completely ruined a flawless app i had no problems before and now the touch sign in never works then every time i try to log in i  have to have a identification code sent to me its so horrible this appi thought updates were to improve an app not  faulty it,1
this app comes in handy and love the touch id featurethis is a great app and update,1
im ltlting tired of this app at times saying we dont recognize his device ampv fix this shyte,0
great app i have absolutely no issues except this print login that never works for me  everything else is awesome,0
app keeps telling my device its not recognized and keeps asking for request verification code this only was needed once now it keeps asking every time i try to log on please fix,1
the app never gave me trouble before but lately it keeps telling me it doesnt recognize my device despite me submitting new codes repeatedly its really annoying ,0
not to be one of those entitled people louis ck would make fun of but i am so fing aggravated by this app that i want to tell it to go amp itself i loved the touch id capability when it worked for about a week but now every single time i log on it acts as though i havent enabled that function and tells me to turn it on in my settings biggest problem is that this glitch tells the app that theres been a security breach and it stops recognizing my phone and makes me request a security code so i have to go through a relatively long process of getting this code and entering it and typing in my password twice just so that i can see my balance and i actually do a lot with this app since i deal mostly in quickpay so this is very very frustrating folks at chase please figure this out before i throttle my poor innocent phone into the sidewalk,1
it would be fivestar app if i was not bugged by this annoying thing after i get the new iphone and restored all apps from icloud the chase keeps showing me dont recognize this device and asks me to get a onetime code to login i tried delete and redownload for five times no luck seems it cant remove the old registration and enable the new one i believe it must happen to someone else too,0
after updating i log in but always get the message we dont recognize this mobile device please request an identification code i have to do this every time i log in,0
terrific terrific terrific terrific terrific terrific,0
after the most recent update the app no longer recognizes my phone if i am not on wifi i need to enter my password and request a new identification code every single time touch id and account preview are also not working consistently i have to enable them each time i sign in the app was great prior to this but i cant give it a good rating at this point as the most basic feature of the app is not working right now,0
you have to enter your password everytime everybody use fingerprint even amazon account and chase still same,0
when i access my username and password then i press log in theres a message or code appears to me every time this message applicationxwwwformurlencodedapplicationjsongot texthtml please help me with this problemi called chase support and apple support they did not help me as well,0
love having a chase app again since i upgraded my phone but so frustrating when it wont accept a check picture ive taken three times  it may just be a system overload and the code just spits out check cant be read and retake great having balance info etc at fingertips thoughupdate super frustrating that it wont accept perfectly lit pictures of checks if i had time to retake pictures of checks for deposit i might as well walk to the bank and do it downgraded to two stars,0
the last  months i have been told per the app that it doesnt recognize my devise i understand its a good ideas on occasion for my security  but ive been asked to obtain a password code  everyday at least  times a day  its becoming a task that i feel it is unnecessary   i do love this app  please advise,0
is very nice app and very completethank you for make one app for people busy,1
i have to request an identification code almost every time i log on,1
worst banking app ever constantly makes me get a new identification code no other app does this i cant utilize touch id or get my quick account balance im deleting and just using the site from now on,0
easy banking,0
keeps requiring me to use an identification code over and over again even if ive used the app before on my phone,0
great app overall clean interface and very easy to use one issue lies with the touchid settings being reset at least once a day requiring that a verification code be sent out prior to logging back in,0
i have to keep resetting my touch id settings for the app ever since i did the latest ios update also i cant login without have to request an access code every single time the app works great when these features work but these bugs are really affecting my user experience,0
the app always asks for identification code each time i log in was ok until this update please fix this is one of my fav apps,0
doesnt recognize my device everytime iog on have ask for a code which is annoying as hell i have a s,0
ui leaves much to be desiredsee capital one or amex apps doesnt take full advantage of touch id you still have to manually enter your password to make a payment or redeem rewards points on top of that the app throws an error when i attempt to redeem rewards in it this app is just an overall bad experience in general and compared to my other financial apps,0
i have been using this app for quite some time and i feel it has been getting more complicated and having more issues with every new updatethe latest problem is that it does not recognize the phone calling it an unknown device every time i need to log in so every time i need to check my balance i have to go through the motions of getting an unlock code from them putting in the code manually typing in the password and setting the touch id on in the settings only to do it all over again the next time i log inhope they fix it or it may be easier to just go to atm,1
was a good app now full of bugs it freezes up so you have to restart it several times before you can even log in then when you do get your information entered it takes  minutes to log in these issues started on  and as of  still not resolved so until they solve these problems dont trust this app,0
every time i log in it requests a new code ridiculous,0
convenience is the whole point behind a bank app or why bother i was in grocery store amp needed to transfer money app said i had to upgrade first ok went to app store yadda yadda yadda first it has to download then it has to initialize then it has to install  tick tock tick tock half hour later still in the store waiting for app to finish its business started the app nothing its stuck i realized that the old version was still running quit it from multitasker restarted pain in the butt clunky upgrade,0
until recently i got a new phone and was promoted to request an identification code to use with my password to sign in reason being the app didnt recognize my new device thats fine i understand and appreciate the security measures it was very unclear what i needed to do once i received the id code but after a frustrating hour or two i finally figured it out but now i get prompted to use an id code bc the app doesnt recognize my device every other day this should not be ive sucked it up and tried to go along with it but now the app freezes and tells me i cant even get the id code i shouldnt need to access my account info the only reason im giving this two stars instead of less than one is bc for years the app has performed nearly flawlessly for me fix this,0
every time i log in it states it doesnt recognize my device even when i log on the same day and requires i get another id code really inconvenient,0
the app is amazing well it was every time i go to log in the app says it doesnt recognize the device i thought it was some sort of glitch so i requested a verification code i then was able to log on logging in again the next day it says it doesnt recognize the device i only log on with one device my phone i even deleted and reinstalled the app and again i have the same problem this is also happening with my sisters chase app i would give it  stars but its honestly annoying having to request a code each and every time i want to log in,0
the app keeps asking me for an identification code literally every time i try to log into my account i am using the iphone s plus,0
when this app functions correctly id give it a  star rating id easily give it a  star perfect rating if they didnt require password authentication for transfers after using the thumb print for signon i dont want to type a password thumb print or simple passcode is finethe problem is that ever since a few updates ago its extremely inconsistent about popping up touch id for login really frustrating that its not popping up and i have to type my full password it used to workalso the biggest problem is the dumb app refuses to remember my device and just about every time i login i need to have a validation code sent for me to confirm this has happened on my iphone  and now my new s plus so two different devices with one being brand new this makes that app close to useless for me because i avoid using it please fix and id be happy to update my review if possible,0
i used the app before and its nice but i cant access my account right nowit says expected status code in  got but i can still access the account through the mobile website,0
cant log in confirmation code doesnt work wont recognize my device when i save my username fix this garbage,1
this app is great but theres some bugs that is going on right now for example when i login i already did my verification code on my new device since i have a new iphone s it keeps asking me to do my identification code and every time i do my identification and change my location it keep asking me to identify myself in the old version i did not have this problem please chase do something about this,0
app is usually great for me but lately it has been kicking me out and saying it doesnt recognize the same phone i have had for forever also when i activate my touch id it will only work one time then it tells me to sign in and go reset it every timei am tired of requesting a identification code,0
the app keeps on telling me to sign in again and use the code with my password it does this over and over again almost every time i try to sign in its really annoying putting in the id code every time please fix,0
whenever i try to log in the app tells me that i need to a confirmation code so that the app will recognize the device which is a great feature but not when it is asking me to do so every time i need to log in ive downloaded and deleted the app to try to refresh it and it still does the same thing its not practical to have me attempt to log in and need a confirmation code every time i need to do so,1
every time i login i have a different experience sometimes the option for touch id doesnt show up forcing me to sign in manually sometimes that works sometimes it says it doesnt recognize this device and needs me to get a code a reset my password and still nothing works i would really appreciate it if the app would just work,0
keeps saying that it doesnt recognize my device every time i would try and login it would ask me for an identification code please fix this thanks in advance,0
the app is great if i can ever get in lately each and every time i try to login it says my device is not recognized but this isnt a new phone because of this i cant see an account preview or anything so anytime i am trying to do something as simple as quickly check my balance i have to go through the identification code process its very frustrating ive uninstalled and reinstalled the app i have the latest version i dont know whats going on but i cant wait for a text or email with a code every time i am trying to log in and i have other banking apps on my phone and none of them say my device isnt recognized so i believe its a problem with the app,0
lately i am being asked to get an identity code every time i try to log in it says it doesnt recognize my device even though i log in only with my phone my touch id is on and its being turned off on its own this app is great but this bug needs to be fixed i dont have to time to put in an identity code every time i need to go into my account thats the whole point of this app the convenience of it this is frustrating and annoying please fix,0
every time i turn on my finger print scanner on the next time i sign on it lock me out and i need to ask for an identification code its getting very annoying and even if leave the fingerprint scanner off it still does it help,0
whats going on with this app lately every time i log in now it keeps asking me for an identification code its getting annoying please fix it,0
why does it ask for an authorization code every single time i want to log in,0
i dont know what you guys did to this app recently but fix it every time i try and use this app the finger print scanner stopped working it asks me to get a identification code every time i use the app waste of time used to be great now its all messed up if you dont want to scream in frustration avoid this app for now till the problems are fixed,1
hello i have an iphone and the app worked fine but lately when i login i have to get a code for the fingerprint every time i login so i have to pass through the process of getting the email get the code and login again the setting the touch id is off i turn it on but it turns off by itself please fix thanks,0
every time i use the app my phone tells me i need to reverify with an authentication code,1
ive had the app for a year and some change now i loved it  you can preview your balance deposit money quick payliterally everything it was so convenient and then one day it just stopped working every time i try to sign in i have to request a new id code because it doesnt recognize my phone  my touch id doesnt work anymore either im so disappointed because i grew to rely on the app get it together chase ,0
great app when it works getting really upset at the fact that i have to request an identification code every time i log in plz fix,0
every time i tap the mobile app to sign in it prompts me to request an identification code for the mobile device i have used the app for months it makes no sense i also cant use an existing code extremely frustrating,0
for about the last month and a half the app keeps saying it does not recognize my device so i have to keep sending myself an identification code on some days i have to do this multiple times its a real inconvenience sometimes and super annoying fix this,1
chase needs to update the app asap you dont need to be asked each time you open the app for a verification code every time already called support amp no help there once you even does the whole process it ask you again once you close the app amp try to check you balance please fix asap ,0
this chase app works well most of the time the touch id part of the app is another story i have it checked off to use touch id and it must lose authentication because it asks me to sign in regularly with password then doesnt recognize my iphone now every time it asks me to log in with password and turn on touch id i have to also authenticate my iphone again and again by getting a sent txt code every single time i dont know if this is a isolated issue,0
this app is invaluable to my business and i use it constantly for all features including quick balance view and deposits  since ios  update it no longer recognizes my mobile device and everytime i login i am required to get a new identification code emailed entered into the app and log in  seconds later the app again does not recognize my mobil app very frustrating i hope this is fixed soon as this will stop me from using the app at all,0
i updated the app as usual but disaster it keeps saying do not recognize this device and ask my for verification code all the time after i quit the app or even put the app in back very annoyed,0
great app but needs some bugs fixed first touch id stopped working the app disabled it on its own  and now  everytime i try to log on i get a pop up saying my device isnt recognized and i need a verification code i dont want to get a verification code everytime i want to log on,0
this app was fine until now  it keeps rejecting my touch id and i am so mad that i have to sign in and punch in a long random code every time i do,0
glitch makes me ask for a verification code every time i log on now and its getting very annoying please fix this problem,0
i used to love this app  it was so easy and made managing my finances simple  lately it has been driving me crazy  almost every time i log in it tells me that it doesnt recognize my device and i have to get an authentication code sent to me before i log in   i dont know if its a bug with the iphone  but ever since i upgraded i have been having this trouble,1
i have been using this app for several months now and it had been working great however for the last month at least i keep getting an error message stating it cant be connected to chase im not sure what the problem is for sure i think it is because i set it up to be able to use the touch id code to sign in anyway  of the times it wont work now i hope it gets fixed soon,0
lost the ability to use touch id which i really liked and now j am being promoted daily to get a new id code and enter it as if it were the first time using this device super annoying and inconvenient,0
since last update i cant login im trying to enter the symbol mad the app wont accept it typed my email into another program and tried to copy and paste it no go app is useless iphone  plus and iphone s,1
please fix the fingerprint security feature every time i use it crashes it has never worked and i really like the fingerprint feature its easier and faster than typing in my whole username and password every time otherwise app is good,0
over all this app is a good app due to everything you need being there the only thing that i find as an inconvenience is the fact that every time i try to sign on to my app it says it doesnt recognize my phone the fact that my phone is not recognized means that i have to request an identification code login with that code and reapply my touch id and preview settings etc this happens every time i have to use the app which is really an inconvenience i for one am not the only one with this problem seeing as peers of mine are too having the same issue fix this bug and the app is perfect,0
this app has been giving me issues the touch id will work fine and then suddenly its asking me to request an identification code cause it doesnt recognize my device its doing this everyday please look into the issue otherwise i have no complaints its a wonderful app,0
i try logging onto my phone or my computer which ive owned for quite a while and it always says it doesnt recognize my device so i have to write down a code every time i want to simply check my balance or transfer money its really not worth the hassle anymore chase isnt worth the hassle,0
the december  update will not allow me to type special characters like periods and commasthis is a problem since my username has a period in itso now i am completely unable to log in to my account this is only a problem in this appi have already tried deleting and reinstalling the app,1
i used to like this app but now it tells me it doesnt recognize my phone each time i try to sign on  so i have to go through the procedure to receive a text message to enter an authorization code  frustrating   i used to sign on with my figure print  that feature doesnt exist anymore  when looking at banks its important that they have good mobile access  through this app its not consistent  go elsewhere,0
i loved this app use it everyday now every time i try to log in with touch id  it says go to settings to set up touch id i log in and tells me unrecognized device send code okay fine thought it was a one time thing due to the update but it does this every time i try to use the app now major inconvenience major disappointment,0
i use to use the quickpay feature to send or request money and never had issues it was usually complete within an hour at the very latest now the past  months when ive sent a payment request to the same person its not complete until a week later days when my tenants funds were taken the same day ive called and they cant give me a reason about to change banks fed up stay away quickpay is slowpay i was going to rate a  or  since its only one feature im having issues but now it seems rating you is difficult this is my rd attempt as after i type and hit send it deletes my review stating my nickname was already used,0
for some reason this apis forgetting my phone over and over i continue to have to request a conformation code to access this app and when i set fingerprint access it only works a few times before the app forgets me and my phone please fix this,0
this would a great app if the log in process worked the majority of the time app never recognizes device constantly being redirected to temporary chase log in code with passcode unable to swipe left to view bank balance even after my settings are updated to touch id login and balance viewable without login it does the same thing over again i still love my bank though fix glitch,0
love it,0
simple and timesaving,0
it constantly states that it doesnt recognize my device sooo i have to keep getting a code sent to me and it always drops my touch id settings and balance at a glance annoying,0
use to work great now for some reason every time i keep having to verify who i am i have to go through the whole text me a code and start all over again ever since its been updated,0
the basic functionality serves its purpose in terms of accessing funds etc but it still leaves a lot to be desired and if youre ever trying to log in from someone elses device the hoops you have to jump through to receive your new code its just a mess i get it your privacy and safety are paramount its just annoying the way its done basically i almost always find myself frustrated with the app but it gets the job done most of the time just needs a little work,0
longtime user  but there are two major flaws when i receive an alert for one of my chase accounts i login to see the reason for the alert when i click on view alerts all i get is a listing of all my chase accounts and no indication whatsoever as to which account the alert is for so i have to randomly click through all my accounts to try and find out which one generated the alert way too much work when i click on view alerts just take me to the account that generated the alert very simplemy second issue just occurred when i tried to post this review the site indicated that my selected username was already in use and i should pick a new one  it also wiped out my entire review and i had to rewrite it not cool,0
best app ever it does what it says it suppose to do,0
seems like every time i check my balance lately i have been asked to get an identification code because my device isnt recognized very annoying,0
love this appmakes online banking so much easier,1
awesome,1
use it daily check balances credit cards make a transfer or quick pay love it  everything i need to know or do with my accounts all here ,1
chase app is very clean and easy to use compared to other banks it is much user friendly only complaint is having to enter code after already using touchid should not need to use both to be able to use some features,0
does everything i need without a hitchgreat job chasegreat to see all my nsf charges are going to good use,0
i guess because they update it every weekendnow it wont remember my settings so i have to have a verification code sent to me everytime i log in i hate this app,0
great and convenient,1
this app used to work great but its annoyingly buggy now  with the latest update it doesnt remember my device or keep the touch login setting  i have to request a special code every time i use it now because it doesnt recognize my device that ive been using for months  i also have to keep selecting the touch login  its almost more trouble than its worth at the moment,0
great app well put togetherlove using this app works well,1
i love chase and as a general rule i have loved my mobile banking app however this version makes me get a new id code about every nd or rd log in it is getting rather annoying please fix it,0
this app wouldve received a  star if the app wouldnt continue to ask me for a verification code everytime i log in at first i thought it was just my phone until a coworker mentioned hers does the same i am writing this review to say yes i love this app but please fix this problem,0
i have used this apple iphone application for many years with chase amazon rewards credit card i find iphone application to be reliable and very useful and i highly recommend this application chase services and amazon rewards as practical worthwhile and convenient,0
appthanks,0
this app use to be great but now when i try to use the touch id i have to verify my account every time i long in with a identification code so for now i just turn it off because every time to try to turn it back on it does the same thing now it take more time to login in,0
it constantly says its a device ive never used so i have to get a code texted to me the touch sign in always turns off automatically really annoying,0
up until a couple of weeks ago the app worked great it took  seconds to log in and see every credit card transaction everything now it keeps saying that it doesnt recognize my device and that i need to get a code texted to me i have done this  times and it still doesnt let me login without it i called and the guy said that it must be my phone because the app doesnt have any issues well my phone works with every other app please fix,0
i also like the fingerprint signon feature i can use the app even in a public place without worrying that someone might see me sign in however it sometimes sends me a message saying it doesnt recognize my device and requires me to get a code from them and then sign on again they need to work on this issue but on the whole i like the convenience and reliability of this app,0
i like the new swipe after login to view balancemessage check is a little confusing,0
even though ive been logging on with the same device for over a year it makes me request an authorization code every time i try to log in,0
great app just need to block out username like other bank apps  five stars if that was done,1
biometrics continue to turn off in your settings after you turn them on  the app doesnt retain ip information so the app thinks you are logging in from a new device and sends an id code every login  very frustrating,0
its a great app very convenient and user friendly my one wish is that the log in screen adds an arrow like the tab function on a keyboard to jump from username to password field boa app does this and i love it,0
there is a bug in the app when multiple people have access to a business account please fix only one member can use touch id quick preview and add their number to quickpay the rest of the members linked to that business account cannot in addition the other members need an identification code every time they access the app since a new number cannot be added we cannot get the identification code via text please fix soon this is so frustrating,1
great app no problems easy to use and works great just one issue when apple updates its system chase app doesnt remember my username like before,0
the new look amp ui improvements are nice the app is smooth amp fast tooall good updated  some things fixed some things still need work updating my rating from  to  because the app works great and keeps getting betterand so here is some feedback for the chase iphone app devs to consider for future app updates  the app needs a better more efficient way to send real feedback about the app directly to the app developers fixed  i am sure people are writing fewer and fewer personal checks these days however i still write checks and so i would really like to have the ability to view check scans from within the chase app fixed  i need to use the chase iphone app to setup reoccurring or scheduled webpays why i cannot do this now is a mystery still needed  i would like the iphone chase app to let me tag my transactions for easier searching and personal budgeting still needed  some other person in the app store mentioned this and i agree that its needed please add ability to mapout your branch amp atm locations based upon my locationthats all for now chase peeps keep up the great workcheers,1
very helpful  makes iteasyto pay bills and transfer etcthanks,1
its great when it works i have to request a personal identification code every other day,0
great app easy to usedoes everything i need although i dont like how i have to type in password for everything and it wont just accept my thumbprint ,1
you can get notifications for multiple scenarios end of year spending breaks down how many times your sorry lazy butt went out to eat,0
overall im really happy with this app not only was i able to link my accounts from amazon to my chase account but when you go to check your statements electronically you can view your due dates this is so helpful for people like me who happen to forget sometimes way to go chase and whoever built this app for you guys ,1
just wish the quick deposit amount field worked properly with a smart phone key pad with mine i have to switch from alpha to numeric after typing each digit butt otherwise the app is great keep it up chase,1
i can no longer use touchid to log on which is very frustrating on top of that every time i go to log on it says it does not recognize my device i have to get an id code emailed to me when i call i am forced to deal with the business accounts team who have no clue about the mobile app this used to be a great app its a mess now if i cant use the app i wont use the card,1
this aplicis good enoughand is great,0
keeps saying it does not identify my device and requires a code every time i attempt to log in making me think twice if i want to check balances etcstill no touch id feature cmon,0
ive been using the chase app since  the features i use the most are remote online deposit account activity and account preview i am selfemployed and my clients pay me by personal check remote online deposit is a huge time saver for me i know that feature is available on other bank apps i use this account for  of my online purchases and can easily keep track of them i also really love the account preview feature without signing in i can quickly swipe to see my available balance i am good at estimating so i account preview lets me know if my deposits are reflected or purchases deducted i have an account at another well known bank their app is more complicated and its easier to do my banking with them on my laptop i cant review bill pay but i have transferred funds to others with chase account and had no trouble,1
i have to get the verification code every time i log in after got help from senior support to cleared cookies from safari the problem still exists need help,0
i just uploadedits good app,0
this app is super easy to use and i am able to manage both my amazon cc with my subaru payments,1
this app had been reliable until the latest update its reliability and features such as account preview and online deposit made this app indispensable unfortunately since i have updated whenever i attempt to sign in i am told it does not recognize my device and asks for an identification code this now happens every time i try to log in my account preview feature is turned off and once ive managed to log in i cant turn it back on i have tried restarting and reinstalling to no availi use this app on a daily basis please please fix it as soon as possible,0
suhhhh dude,1
one of the first as well as the best the introduction of the check deposit via app was brilliant have utilized it while out of countryi have the same complaint as others herei have several accounts with chase when i get a notificationit never lists which account it refers toomy having to sort thru my accounts to determine where it came from is self defeating boa seems to have bested chase with their new bar code app for atms,0
not sure if anyone else is having issues with the app not recognizing a device ive used the chase app since its release no problems till now my phone was recently stolen now offline amp the app refuses to remember and recognize my replacement device i have to enter an identification code every time every time its maddening customer service says it my phone setting but i dont see how if the replacement phone was exactly like the prior settings and all maddening end rant,0
i have the chase credit card and a chase mortgage this app makes it easy for me to keep track of both some requests for improvement maintain username or allow for finger print sign in seems to be finicky allow for and give option miduse for push notifications messaging around statement available and payment received,0
easy simple straightforward,1
convenient app but its always crashing and constantly asking for an identification code every time i log into my app this needs to be fixed asap,0
always have to put in a pin code to sign in the id scanner never works over it ,0
i troubleshoot the problem and figure out that when i change the language to english us it start to work when i was in japanese login and prompt  expected status code in  got  but thats definitely not the server connecting problems,0
after the last update it doesnt recognize my phone and i have to have a code texted to me every time i use it,1
if you think that you dont need to switch banks when you move youre wrong  at least  of my checks wont go through this app is soooooo inconsistent  personal check from grandma with arthritic chicken scratch goes through perfect  check from a multibillion dollar employer  sorry your routing number and and account number couldnt be found  please try again after  weeks after weve hit you with  overdraft fees  after the th time i would rather just get a message that says f off  well deal with your s when we deal with it,0
im so annoyed i spent  min inside bank creating a password  it will not work  ive been trying to reset password  nothing is good enough i called bank they tell me try again iv wasted  hrs now and still cant get in  keeps telling me password must be  letters or number must have a capital or simbals bla bla bla ive done everything correct and still nothings working  this is completely redic i   give it negative  stars big wast of time,1
while this app is certainly convenient i would advise anyone interested in downloading this app to refrain as chase will use this app against you in the event you need to dispute a charge i was victim of identity theft and funds were stolen i didnt notice until a few days later and chase ultimately said it was my fault because i had access the app with username and password and didnt report it sooner  since then i have resubmitted my claim in hopes that my issue will be rectified do not download this app,0
every now and then the app decides that my fingerprint is not good enough and i have to go to through the process of requesting a new code via text message since the device is not recognized i havent changed phones and this is really frustrating,0
touch id stopped working keep having to turn it one every time and it automatically turns off have to get a verification code every time i log on problem only started as of ,1
this version requires me to enter the identification code every single time when i try to log on  it also frequently shuts off the touch id automatically,1
everytime i log in it tells me it doesnt recognize my device even if i was in it  min before its very annoying to have to send a text message with an activation code every single time,0
why doesnt this app hide characters of saved usernames anyone using my phone can see my saved username bank of america app is more secure in this aspect and hides characters of saved usernames,0
the app is great  once youre able to log in this app randomly decides that it doesnt recognize my iphone and asks for an identification code in addition to password i have to request a code via email then enter it in addition to my password a few days go by with no problems logging in then all of a sudden    device not recognized request an id code again this is a major bug in the app and needs to be fixed asap,0
i used to love this app until recently now every time i try to use the app on my phone it asks me to request an identification code because it doesnt recognize my device ive had to request one  times today fivethe touch id also never works whenever i go to use it it gives me an error to long in and turn it on in the settings it ischase please fix this is so painful to use anymore,0
whenever i log oout of the app the next screen goes blank when i close out and reopen the app its still blank i have to remove the app from my phone and reinstall each time i want to go back into the app please fix this glitch,0
i have been a long time chase mobile app user and of late i am seeing several issues with the ability to remember my device specially when i have touch id enabled it is frustrating to get the code and log in,1
the app was first installed when i was in my home and using y home wifi and it was familiar with my mobile data connection when i am connected to either my home or my cell data the app works perfectly but when i am connected to a new network it is automatically disabling the touch log in option for example if i am connected to my office networkwhich is secure btwit is asking for one time code sent to my phone and enter that and my password againthis is big bug in your app and you need fix this soon hate it when it requires password and identity check again and again even if i am new network  learn to recognize a secure network coz all other bank apps are working fine ,1
the app is great in many ways but there is a bug when you type an amount the  button does not work so basically the check deposit functionality is useless if you receive an amount which is xxxxx as you will not be able to indicate the cents,0
used to be a rock solid app but now i frequently get a message saying we dont recognize this mobile device and it requires me to request a temporary id code i have done this  times since jan  each time it allows me to select the mobile device it no longer recognizes to send the code to very frustrated at this point deleted the app and reinstalled it but no improvement,0
this app gets better with each update it makes life so much easier for someone who likes to balance amp track their accounts amp funds as they go however today it wont allow me to log into my accounts giving me this pop up message,0
expected status code in got please help or fix this issue thank you,1
i love this app its wonderful   ,0
about  times a week it refuses to be activated  by thumbprint it also does not recognize my phone so i have to request an authorization code texted  to me sometimes this happens  times in the same day this has been happening for about months now and each new update has not rectify the problem  please help,0
awesome,1
this app is so much more convenient that i almost never use chasecom on my laptop anymore however there are a couple of improvements that are long overdue the alerts feature is difficult to navigate we never know which account has the alert its annoying to have to go through every account to find the one with alerts also online payments cant be canceled on the ipad version of the app if you need to cancel a payment via the ipad app you have to go to another platform iphone or laptop not helpful the ipad app should be capable of all of the operations available on the iphone,1
i use to love my chase app but once i moved from my s to my s it started to act weird it constantly ask me to verify my device on all of my devices i tried deleting the app then reinstalling it and even went through all setting features to see if i could fix it but it still does it almost every time i go to log in i have to get a text with a code and then i can use the app it is so annoying because all i did was move to a new phone and i have used the same ipad for the last few years now i figured the first time i logged in it would do that but not every time it is so aggravating i would love a solution to this problem if someone could please help me,1
everything seems to work as promised  one major point of frustration is the app regularly forgets the device im using and makes me obtain an identification code to log in  this happens every couple of days and has become quite annoying,1
about  in  times i use this app it fails to recognize my device and i have to get another access code ahhh,1
noob developers they allow you to paste your password on the main screen but dont allow you to paste your password into the password field on the identification code page very frustrating for generated passwords on a mobile device,0
while the ui is decent the fact that i have to keep entering my password after ive logged in with apple id this needs to be addressed for people whose password is ,1
nice alot of different thangs now,1
silfxmaskscom realistic full face silicone masks,1
needs improvement,1
awesome,1
its fast easy and simple to use  you can easily deposit a check from your house and itll be there in your account the next business day  the only thing they need to improve is the identification problem  sometimes when i log out and then try to use my finger touch to login it wont recognize my device and have me do the whole process of entering the code it sends me it did this  times in  days  otherwise its a cool app,1
would like more ease in searching transactions but cant have it all it seems that the app forgets my phone at least once a day and a code has to be sent thats annoying,1
this is the easiest and most user friendly bank app it is the most secure i have encountered as you need to get a code from the bank physicallyyes a pain but in the end once all is good and done it is well worth it,0
user friendly,1
works as advertised,1
this app needs improvements on the security portion for example the touch id shuts itself off at least four times a day for me and i never shut it off myself and if the touch id is shut off i have to keep requesting an identification code and asking about my number once that is done it ask me the same thing five minutes later and customer service doesnt even know how to deal with it at all they are clueless,0
used to be great but keeps asking for new code as if it was a new device that the chase app isnt recognizing i understand the security one time but it happens every few time i log in i hope this problem is fixed soon,0
i had written a longer review describing my pleasure with the chase app initially unfortunately i can no longer access my account on the app without first being prompted to request a verification code because my device isnt recognized i hope there is an update on the way that helps with this issue because it is causing me to dread any time i need to use the app,0
great mobile banking,0
adequate,0
no support for ios ,0
i love the app its pretty easy to use  the only complaint i have is i would like to be able to access other services when i log in to my account now i have to go into chasecom to access taking a picture of my check or transferring money to my children,1
i have an iphone  app doesnt work with my current ios ,1
overall this app is great everything is simple  to navigate and understand they show pretty much everything youd want on a mobile app the only issue is i will have to request a new identification code every few months because it doesnt recognize my phone as an authorized device even though i couldve logged in using my phone the day before fix that and this is five stars,1
this app is just ok half of the time it does not recognize my phone and i have to request a new access code hopefully they fix this problem soon it also no longer allows me to open it with my finger,1
why alerts arent fingerprint activated is beyond me otherwise this app is an essential for any chase customer,0
not bad app once you get into it have had to reconfirm with code three times how long before it recognizes my phone,0
this app kicks butt satisfies every need for banking,1
hands down one of the best apps to use for information on your accountalso easy to use,0
app works mostly as intended very annoying how it keeps forgetting not only that i have touch id enabled but also keeps forgetting the device entirely requiring a text or email code and my password about every other time i try to log in,0
love this appable to use to anywhere i am,0
very disappointed im sure there are a lot of us with iphone  that got cut off,1
the new update is only for ios and up i have an iphone  that cant go above ios so i cant use my app ,0
much thanks to art at glenoaks and westernthank u i love my app,0
doesnt effin work,0
everything on my phone works fine on ios  but your appive been delaying ios upgrades because apple releases terrible upgrades that improve nothing but take up memory and cause the phone to rapidly run through battery lifei had to give in and update because you refuse to support ios  anymorenow my phone goes from  battery life to dead in  minutesthanks chase thinking about switching banks now,0
there are no chase branches in md so its telling of this app that i rarely if ever need a branch  hour drive it opens quick its exceedingly stable code i can sign easily using my fingerprint and even preview balances with one swipe i deposit checks no problem send someone money piece of cake,0
excellent,0
i love the app except the touch id always stops working also the app is always saying my device is not recognized with every logon and i always have to request a new code customer service said this is a known issue can someone please fix this frustrating issue,1
keeps asking me to enter code because it apparently doesnt recognize my phone anymore it also disables my touch id on its own im not very happy with this application right now,1
i dont get a chance to use this app every day if i just found the one chance to be able to do it i would when i first got it though i fell in love with this app chase is taking small steps to continually improve and meet customer expectations this app was not free to produce so in a sense i paid for this with the monthly fees and interest they are making with my dollars and cents being stowed away deep in their account at the moment i only have one account and it is checking easily access deposit history and monthly statements i feel very safe and secured with this app my username had to include numbers this go around so it was important for me to set it up in a way that i could not be or get hacked once again as far as i know this app deserved more credit i would like to give a special thanks to the team of individuals who were involved in the making of this app it must have taken years of trial and error before it became what it is today these people are still behind the scenes constantly working to improve user interfaces and reliability this app will not change because it is so great,1
chase overall seems weak on privacy two examples when you save your username you can actually see the entire username when you open the app part of it should always be shielded similarly they still print the entire credit card number on their paper bills not good,0
convenient and robust,0
relationship manager chase private client simon ofususomuah  walked me through true entire process and helped expedite transfers for free from hsbc impressive seamless,0
its bad enough the username doesnt save as you entered it but when pulling up that app on my ipad i have to physically turn the screen  with my other apps especially banking the screen adjusts automatically  this really needs to be fixed  the banklocation told me to enter my username funny because the website amp app couldnt make the adjustment  at the least these  things need to be fixed,1
i like the features it has in place for convenient and quick checking of your balance particularly the touch id login i wish more apps had that option its so quick that i often use it even when im near my computer as i dont need to enter my username and password but simply place my thumb on the scanner my only complaint is not being able to see the full names of transactions with long names eg atm deposits with a long series of numbers but thats rather negligible,1
i will suggest to app developer to add free credit score checkthat will be perfect for all the people,1
simple attractive and functional,1
love using the app but the touch id feature is always failing  then you have to log in and have an authentication code sent to you even though i use the same device each time it says it doesnt recognize the device gets very annoying because it happens at least once or twice a week  i use an iphone ,1
worthless to me now when i try to log on it only gives me a screen telling me there is a version that works with ios and i should upgrade my ios to use it  but cant up grand and it doesnt let me into the app now,1
needs fingerprint access,1
im very upset because chase is no longer supporting ios  and i can not upgrade to ios   chase is forcing their users to upgrade which is ridiculous  my phone can not handle new system  i will no longer bank with chase just for this  thanks again,1
updated  consistently reliable and has the best features in the market it saved me from getting double charged once while traveling i received  notifications for the same purchase while waiting to pay i thought it was extremely helpful a long with anything else i have said in previous reviews its awesome updated  i use it almost everyday very stable and reliable i love that i get notifications when i use my cards associated with my accounts and has kept me from getting double charged while on vacation i was still at the register and caught it they finally added touch id to open the app quickly love it deposits are smooth even though they dont use the flash they have improved reliability of the scan over older versions or maybe its having a better camera on the iphone  either way it works much better i think this app works great and is better than the first version but they dont use the flash or even just turn on the light on the iphone  so that you can take a clearer pic of checks for deposit i have to use a bright light source near the check to get a pic the system will accept also for people with deposit problems if you darken the dotperiod between the dollars and cents it will read your check better the first time given you have enough light in the first place,1
every time i use this app it says it does not recognize the device and i have to request a code and input it its so annoying i have deleted the app n downloaded it again n it still has this issue please fix it other than that its a great app,1
app rarely works when i need it to seems as though it only works when connected to wifi i usually have to go online to chasecom on my phone no point in having the app except for the mobile deposit which i can only use while at home,1
for a bank app accepting pin code instead of touch id is not acceptable other then that its a decent app,1
awesome banking app ,1
every few days i attempt to log into the app and i get a notification that the app doesnt recognize my device and i have to confirm with a code each time touch id turns itself off horrible app,1
im frustratedis anyone having this issue with the app just recently its been giving me stress im using the app now for two yearsmy own personal phone not sharing it with anyone i set up touch id to sign into the account recently i get an error message that it doesnt recognize my device i have to get a code to sign into my account i then reactivate the touch id sign on log out and go on with my life i try to sign on at a later time i get the touch id prompt but then immediately i get an error message that says i need to sign in again with my id and reactivate touch id im frustrated really what is the issue is anyone else having this problem today i deleted the app rebooted my phone and im now hoping for the best please help,1
i use this app to deal with the chase credit card i got through amazon it takes two seconds to pay my bill easy a+,1
im not a fan of chase but continue to bank with them bcz if security and knowing that if i have issues with vendors they will diligently access the is so for memy favorite feature is the ability to send money to ppl without having to go to a branch or arm quick pay is my life,1
i really enjoy this app due to the fact that its easy and it provides excellentup to date information its very easy to pay my credit card and you have a choice to scan your finger instead of using the typical password and username feature very cool ive had washington mutual before chase took over and was pretty worried but it was an easy transition and they actually made my banking experience better thank you chase,0
i do not understand strategy of chase bank for not keeping their mobile app backward compatible with older version of ios does chase want their users to shell out money to buy new apple iphone which can run on latest ios my iphone is old and can not hold latest ios due to performance issues this makes me remain disconnected from my own chase accounts another twist in story is chasecom does not open on safari i keep getting error at time of login oops something went wrong we are looking into itcontacting chase cust care does not help as they themselves are helpless i do not understand whether it is a mistake of not keeping app backward compatible or a strategy to increase apples sell of latest iphone,1
thanks for continuing ios support but now it just keeps asking for you to update when no such update exists and so the app is unusableplease fix,1
i am still on ios  since i dont have enough memory to upgrade my phone ever since the new update i cannot login into my chase account because i must upgrade my ios version ,1
the app is great overall but not relative to chasecomplease integrate more basic features so the app is as robust as possible  for example it does not show me the current amount due on a credit card account  only the total balance  that type of omission makes me have to spend extra time tracking it down which is a pain when not at a computeralso statements were not available despite tapping a see statements link  and in this case viewing the statement would have given me the balance due figure i was seekingif you can simply provide the payment amount options radio buttons with choices like full amount due current statement balance or pay other amount just as you do on chasecom that would be very helpful,1
this app is ok but it could use a serious update  id prefer to see not only my current balance but the due date as well when i open the app  also this app should be able to be opened with touchid,1
at least once a week the app does not recognize this device so you have to get an identification code very annoying and not very convenient,1
saves me time i only have to enter my password once instead of entering a password and having to use an authentication code,1
chase app is an incredibly useful tool in every occasion with nearly every tool mirrored from chasecom i use the chase app for all my banking needs,1
so before the last update i loved this app now every time i try to sign in it tells me it doesnt recognize the device and thus i have to have a safety code sent to my email or phone before i can sign in now granted its trying to keep my acct safe  when i say every time i mean e v e r y t i m e and it gets quite annoying because i use the app a lot  also the preview and touch feature is bunk  one minute it work the next time i try to use it it doesnt and says i have to log on to set it up  again but catch this before i can log on i need that secure code to make sure im the owner of the acct its become a pain and im ready to delete the application entirely because it takes up way too much time to have to type in this information every time i wish to log on and check my acct  please fix this,0
app will no longer work on iphone  cant even open thanks chase,1
awesome,1
i have been a very happy chase customer for  years i changed banks from fifth third whom i loved and was loyal to since i was  when i moved from ohio to california and wanted a bank with a strong national presence they have been great and love how easy the app is and the website is  especially since i have a a couple different chase ccs like freedom southwest and amazon and they all appear on the main account page my biggest complaint costs them two stars because it would be a huge plus being able to schedule automatic recurring transfers or payments  from a chase checking to a chase credit card fifth third had this option and it was awesome i would simply set up a recurring transfer of a certain dollar amount set up on a weekly or biweekly basis there is no transfer option with chase you can only make payments and if you want to make multiple payments in a month you have to set up each individual payment its highly annoying and inconvenient i put all of my charges on credit cards like a lol of people do and i pay my credit cards off every month but instead of one big lump sum coming out on the payment due date  which right now is the only option  it would be nice to set up recurring automatic transfers of a certain dollar amount like week for example and then on the payment due date only the remaining amount due for the statement balance would then come out of my checking only other complaint i have is i was trying to log in to the chase app last night and again today and an error message came up saying sorry we are unable to connect right now please try again later kept trying thinking maybe it was just a glitch finally decided maybe to check to see if my cellular data was turned on for chase and sure enough it was off whats odd though  and again an inconvenience and annoying  is whenever any other app has cellular turned off and you try to access it off wifi a message will pop that says cellular data for this app is turned off please go to settings to change and has a link directly to settings within the pop up if it was a smaller business  or app i rarely use then i would maybe not be as irritatedbut its chase bank a huge financial institution and i dont believe my expectations of functionality ease of use reliability and available features are unreasonable love you chase  just want you to be the best,1
this app covers basic transfer between accounts bill pay but i still have to go to chasecom on computer to do more,1
the mobile deposit limit on this app is ridiculously low to make this application convenient it might work for a teenager in high school but not functional for professional adult a  limit per day with a cap of  per month is a joke the information provided for checks debit or credits is very limited in its view you can get much more detailed information by going onto the full website it defeats the purpose of having a mobile application which ironically is less useful than the full website,1
turned on remember my id and fingerprint still makes me go through requesting an identification code i understand the security and all but not every other time that is the most annoying part please fix it,1
i use this almost every month to deposit checks and the only thing i would like to see is the limit of k checks increased to the monthly limit or higher because i often get checks for  and have to go to a branch to deposit,1
the app is fine but every time i log in i have to request an identification code as if i dont log in every other day its very annoying,0
the app has been great in the past and ive used it for years it recently started to turn off my previews it also started to not recognize my phone each time i log in its super annoying to ask for an id code and enter it each time,1
i am highly inconvenienced with the amount of times my touch id in the app switches from on to off in which the only way i can log in is to have to request a security code every single time fix this immediately please and thank you,1
 app says its older version requires ios  or above but my iphone  has ios  and this chase app will not open at all instead of being in bed with apple and effectively forcing you to buy a newer model iphone to use chase bank app they should work on making product backwards compatible thus increasing instead of decreasing the number of customers who can use it,1
if i must enter my password to do anything then what is the point of enabling touch id  it only half a works,1
every time i try to use touch id to log onto this app i have to obtain a security code then go into the app and turn touch id back on for some reason touch id just turns off arbitrarily it is very annoying,1
love it decreases my need to physically go to the bank by only way it and chasecom could improve would be to allow the spouse to see the amount on the credit card not just the person who established it,1
works smoothly without major issues,1
the app keeps asking me for an identification code every time i log in saying that it doesnt recognize my device when this happens it also disables touch id login this issue happens every single time i dont know why this is happening,1
not enough time given to put down text code for verification to log in,1
i always use this app for its quick pay capabilitiespaying my credit card bills is also a great function on this appmy ability to monitory my credit card activity is also great feature which came in handy two separate occasions faulty charges where made on my card in the past overall a great app and basically dose anything i need it to only thing i wish it could do is quick pay people who dont have chase which would be a great added feature,0
couldnt read a printed  check,0
what can you say about this app its the official chase app its secure its easy to useyou can deposit checkscheck your balancetransfer money,1
omg i love this app even more now instead of typing in your whole username and password you can now use apple id fingerprint,1
seems to work very well for me for those who have a specific gripe do what you are doing by putting your concerns into you reviews although it may take some time to change the code within the app if enough users gripe about an issue it will usually be addressed in an app upgrade,1
chase makes banking super convenient with this app cant imagine using any other bank ever,1
every other day it says that it doesnt recognize my device and it just randomly turns of touch id i have to request a security code to log in then go and turn touch id back on its so inconvenient especially when im in the go,1
after the last update every time i sign in it tells me that my phone is not recognized i then have to have a code texted to me to access my account incredibly frustrating,0
i love this app it makes bill paying a snap it has eliminated the need for stamps all my bills are paid electronically so no problem if i dont have stamps or the post office is closedmaking a deposit with a check is fabulous just take a pic front and back and send it super easyyou cant go wrong with chase truly,0
when it works its fine but  times out of  the touch id fails to work so i log in with my password and each time this happens it claims it doesnt recognize the device the only device ive ever used to log in on so i have to request an identification code to my phone to be able to log in also i find it annoying that you have to input your password again to get to the message center once youre already logged in,1
extremely irritating constantly makes me go to a website to get a special code rather than just letting me log in and using my name because it says it doesnt recognize this device its the same device my phone i use every time,0
i love the chase app it has all your accts in one place to pay credit card auto loan and amazon acct easy to use and very convenient great job chase,1
this was a great app now its garbage the latest update i downloaded on  renders the app unusable it crashes on login every single time i restarted my device and no better hoping for a fix in the next update i have used the app a lot over the past few years and this is a first,1
ever since the update of  my app is still waiting to download  i tried deleting it to try and reinstall but i cant even access itit is just darkened and says waitingwhat is going on with this appi even tried updating it thru the itunes but that didnt work eitherhelp i need my chase mobile app,1
the app force closes before i can even log in it is pissing me off and im thinking about switching banks,0
needs bug fixes,1
that works great as far as checking balances and transferring between accounts but still no support for touch id and i need to get an identity code every time i log in really why my wife and i share an account we both use the app can we both have access to the app,1
add fingerprint login,1
app is very convenient but there is a need to hide the username during the login process,1
this app just works as expected  starsfinger print account access to view accounts password needed to xfer between accounts and to do other tasks simple easy efficient,1
using your bank is very easy and helpful  thank you chase  customer relations best  howard beach,1
easy to used is really nice that you get to send money to someone else by using quickpayit just makes my life easier,1
groovy,1
con it always forgets my phone and i have to get a code this happens  minutes after i just used it happens  of the time when i go to log on pro i love the convenience of the app and all i can do with it fix the phone recognition  i never had this problem with my iphone  it started with the iphone ,1
chase chase chase chase chase chase chase chase chase chase chase chase chase chase chase chase chase chase chase chase chase chase chase chase chase chase chase chase chase chase chase chase chase,1
nobody reads these reviews but the app works i can check how much champagne guapi i got in the reserves,1
love it and it keeps me on track of my needseasy to use and easy to access,1
i like this app i really do but it needs to tally the balance for you to include pending charges  i have the amazon card and amazon individually charges each item so you need to go in and add up the charges versus the app showing a running total this is only an issue for people who like to pay as they charge and have an amazon addiction ,1
while the functionality of this app is superb the latest version crashes constantlyive reverted back to opening the browser and going to chasecom to do my bankingi really hope they plan to fix it otherwise the app in its current version is not useable for me,1
awesome,0
this app is wonderful but my only complaint is that  times i go to login the app suddenly doesnt recognize me and i have to request a code to get back in to my account i log in to my app about  times a week and  of those  times i am an unknown user i have called chase many times about it and all they say is that theyre working on it no one else uses my device so its unnecessary to keep doing these security checks its only been like this for the past few months so hopefully chase fixes it,1
chase chase chase chase chase chase chase chase chase chase chase chase chase chase chase chase chase chase chase chase chase chase chase chase chase chase chase chase chase chase chase chase chase chase chase chase,1
almost every time i long in the app makes me request an identification code the app also keeps turning off my touch logon i have four banks and this is the absolute worst app,1
great servicegreat app too,1
terrible i called six or seven times they keep asking for a code and every other time i go on with a finger print it does not work and i have to go into settings again and put my finger print in againim getting tired of it and thinking of going to another credit card,1
awesome,1
i love this bank personally on phone amp very helpful patient amp extend curtsey to the customeri had the app awhile amp,1
like it allot u can view as far back as u like amp menu of options is greati love getting the alerts on activity based on my options  love iti recently became a amazon prime member amp once i activated the card it automatically went to my chase app wo me having to establish or anything,1
i am constantly told that my account does not recognize my phone and it requires an identification code every time i log on,1
easy to use app that gives me the flexibility to make payments deposit checks whatever i need to do dont believe its ever been unavailable when trying to use it i highly recommend,1
it never recognizes my device ive been using the same phone for a year and every time i go to sign in with my password or touch id  i have to have a code sent to me whats the point of using the touch id feature on this app then very frustrating,1
good with access to account and great with touch id pass code access desperately needs to be updated to be able to pay bills with touch id easily too cumbersome having to type passcode every time pita restriction,1
have the app due to the amazon visa card is chase easy to navigate through and make payments a child could operate this app without issue,1
its great,1
i wouldve given the chase mobile app four stars or maybe even five except for this one problem it works great on my iphone s + but it constantly fails to recognize my ipad and i have to continually download a special code and send it back to chase to complete any transaction really getting tired of that otherwise its a fantastic app,1
the chase bankng appmakes banking extremely convenientfrom checking to see your balance at a glance to depositing checks via phone i can check my credit card as well make your payments etcchase does it all,1
app is ok but needs more userfriendly options for example a quick view screen showing balance and available credit and when the minimum payment is due also a way to quickly sign in like a sure swipe code or a number code,1
so convenient and easy to use everything is at your fingertips ,1
helpful,1
st i have  iphones i get a message from the chase mobile app that it doesnt recognize my iphone when ive previously used the other iphone having to get a new code sent from chase but deauthorizes the the other phone in that process it didnt seem to start out that way but after pingponging back and forth with the authorization thing about  times i gave up now i just wait to use my personal phone instead of my business phone  a painndi cant deposit my paycheck as the limit is  its a bit too easy to go over the daily or weekly limit i could see if the limit was  but  is a bit restrictive,1
very convenient to be able to take a pic of a check instead of needing to drive to the bank to deposit it no real quirks over all good just wish with that with the amounts listed there would be the running balance like   +  etc,1
flawless,1
identification code when sent to phone does not stay on long enough,1
the app keeps loosing my finger printi called numerous times to no availim ready to dump the credit card,1
hard to sign onto app doesnt recognize my iphone + and keeps asking for an identification code wish app displayed more debit information such as place item purchased or some other identifier,1
awesome,0
a+++++++,1
i think this app is really great in many ways especially for its remote deposit feature it however could use a cache memory like ability to store all check deposit data when the chase system is down for later upload without the need for continued reentry until it comes back upit could also use the ability to allow ach transactions if you have a chase business acct that you access through it i also wish it would allow deposits greater than  i feel  is more a much more reasonable upward limitas long as your check clears why does it matter what amount is written there why have a deposit limit through this app at all  do hand written checks have limits dont they get scanned in to bank systems through atms and by living  bank tellers regardless of their amounts clearance time to verify the check is the key to reduce the likelihood of check fraudamp that gets done either way hope chase is listening,1
the app makes me to put an identification code frequently this becomes annoying when you just want to check a few things quick is this smth i can fix in the setting,1
every other app i use with a password has updated to sign in quicker with a thumb or a shorter code when will chase do this,1
great bank very easy to use this apppay billstransfers etc,1
loss of backwards compatibility for ios is extremely frustrating i cant log on due an error message that states i need to update my phone news flash chase some people are still using iphone  and cant update to ios all my other apps still let me download an older ios friendly version to not allow that alienates customers,1
i can do most things from my phone and just using my fingerit save a lot of time and money,1
love it never had any problems  would recommend,1
i am very happy with the chase app save for the following featurewhen opening the app there is the option to use fingerprint id on ios this is great but what makes me nervous is that when the fingerprint recognition does not work which is often for me as i work in construction and my prints are either dirty or damaged the secondary access is through the iphone lock screen code this isnt the case with the bank of america app that i use that requires me to input my bank of america password to continue and access my banking information now i understand that any transfers or important transactions will require a chase password i think this is a little sloppy on the chase app will give  stars once this is rectified,1
on the plus side some quick functions depositing checks paying bills quick pay and transfer of funds minus sideeh side touch id doesnt work frequently need a code texted or emailed to me in order to log on a few more clicks than necessary to get where i need to be or where i think i need to be only to find out i am at a dead end,0
awesome,1
i would give it five stars but i have to type in my username everytime and sometimes im in a hurry and it gets annoying fix that and ill proudly give it five stars lovechasebank,1
the app is easy to use what bugs me is that for the first months the fingerprint log in worked great but now i have to go and restart it i have to specifically tell it to accept my finger print  this will last for maybe a day or two then it makes me verify it again sometimes i have to reset my password not sure if this is a glitch for the last update but fix it cause it is pissing me off wells fargo had nothing that could compare to this until recently and right now im starting to want to switch over,1
until they recently updated it i lived it i have to do an identification code everytime i eant to use it,1
great app i just wish you could have access to maybe  dollars upon mobile deposit like other banking systems also a higher limit for banking deposits or an easier way to up your depositing limit a  daily limit maybe  to cover the transfer of large monthly expenditures,1
always make your life easy with chase mobile appit is very convenient and simple to use so far no any complaint great thanks,1
new update full of bugs always logs me out and asks for a new identification code each time  extremely annoying ,1
this is a good app although not the equivalent of bank of america like the bank better though wish i could deposit more than  by phone,1
once again chase does a great job this app works great with no bugs and has a clean interface,1
i used to have touch id enabled to login with this recent update i no longer have hat option i logged in with my username and password and cannot even find an option to enable it was the touch id feature removed,1
i mainly use the app to check account balances and recent transactions so id like to see edge swiping supported to make navigating multiple accounts more convenient especially because this use case is so common heres the code in swift please pass it on to your development teamin viewdidloadlet edgepan  uiscreenedgepangesturerecognizertarget self action selectorselfscreenedgeswiped_edgepanedges  leftviewaddgesturerecognizeredgepanfunc screenedgeswipedrecognizer uiscreenedgepangesturerecognizer if recognizerstate  recognized call the back arrow function,1
i really do like this app because of options like quick pay and being able to deposit checks quickly and the account preview so you can check how much you have in your bank account on the low and fast but since you guys have been advertising that credit card that im not even going to get approved for any way because ive defaulted on school loans is making the whole app crash and i was like yay when you guys let that go but know your desperate plea like every other app to get ratings is making the app freeze i cant even check my balance or anything so you asked for it you got it i give you two stupid stars because youre pissing me off,1
the new version of the app says it will only work on ios or newer well i have a phone with ios and it doesnt work my other phone has ios every week or so i have to delete the app then reinstall it so it will work otherwise it times out and closes on its ownupdate now ive redownloaded it and it still doesnt work times out then closes stillif this is the case i may need to switch banks,1
f their bank fees tho,1
it is a credit card to have the only problem i had was when it took a while for my first payment to be usable on my account even though it withdrew from my bank and the payment posted on my account it still took almost  weeks for the funds to be available to use again otherwise its great they say it wont happen again,1
i love the app i did like the old background but im getting used to the newthe alerts are great  i love quick pay my wife and i use it very often and how cool is picture deposit  save me time i can look for a bank near me where ever i amvery satisfied   thnk you,1
i really love the app works great can do everything right in it its also pretty cool with the amazon card,1
im so happy with  this appso easy to use,0
i pay my bills thru chase and frequently check my balanceactivity its generally user friendly i still would like to see a way to post written checks online to be deducted from my account at the time of paying  then officially deducted when the check is posted at the bank this would allow the customers a way to keep on top of actual activity from all sources instantly just code the checks pending in a different color or such to distinguish them from actual deductions,1
i lovvvvvvv dissss shiiiii,1
i downloaded the app because the amazon rewards credit card is issued by chase the notifications are prompt very little load time works awesome though i have not figured out how to setup the fingerprint access on my iphone so i have to always input my password i wish there was a widget that showed me the balance on the notifications pull down menu,1
great app,1
this app has grown over the years into a mature application that is a great alternative to their website now all that chase and the rest of the banks in the us need to work on is making deposits and wiretransfers from all major banks available instantly because we all know that its not a technical limitation lastly id like to encourage chase to start handling all their site maintenance while the site is still available if google can ensure at least  uptime im sure chase can get above  as it turns out it can be crucial for people to be able to access their own money that they let you make a profit with through loans etc even on a sunday start treating your average customer with the same level of importance and respect as your large corporate clients without the average johnjane the majority of your actual cash is gone and a large part of your business model with it,1
miss the number code to be able to sign in though,1
better than open access on internet i cant speak to security however i enjoy not having to enter all my log in data and then wait for a code to actually access the regular website,1
more details about transactions needed,1
superappit really saves my time a lot,1
yes ,1
ive actually never had problems with the chase app until a week ago it started to kick me out of the app every time i tried to log in my account then shortly after it started saying that my phone was a unrecognized device to login with and that i needed some verification code to login with the app then i would have to submit what way i wanted chase to send me the verification code via text call or email then id have to use the given code along with my password to loginfinally i think its very time consuming and inconvenient to have to go through such hoops while youre on the go i really like banking with chase but id hate for them to lose my business over an app,1
i got this card since i use amazon quite often so far this has been a good business choice,1
very helpful ,1
i have not had any major issues with the app as i use it for the simple basics of account management it keeps me up to date on my funds the alert system works great i have not had any problems with the app it also is connected with my southwest and amazon card works really well,0
its very usefullove it,0
this app constantly asks me for  a code nearly  of the time i have to request an id code to get in very inconvenient,1
this is around the rd chase app i have used and this one is far the best one yet   very easy to use you can transfer money into you checking account from checking to savings and vice versa it will remember your user id and if it does not recognize the device it will send a code to your phone or email  good job,1
i have had  dollars taken out of my account and despite calling their customer service and them telling me they would take care of it the following day they still have not not the first problem i have had with chase either despite only being with them for less than a week i will likely be canceling my account and taking my money elsewhere absolutely pathetic,1
hey you interested in making  in  hours no bs games or anything  all legit business do not ignore this message this is all serious my contact is ,1
this app just keeps getting better  i deposited a check with my iphone and it worked perfectly   this app kicks butt  if you bank with chase get this app,1
good job guys,1
good app just wish i could login using touch id versus manually typing my username and password,1
i dont likethat there are so many security updates and it doesnt tell you before logging in that you need to update why not cant there be simple version checker code right when the app opens its annoying to have to log in twice all the time  it seems slow at times im not sure if thats my slow  gb iphone s though other than those its nice and convenient,1
cant easily access my payment history or marriott rewards,1
ive been with chase for a few months now and the app for chase is easy to usenavigatewith no hiccupsthe level of online security and notification alerts are securerecently i had an issue at a hotel where the low level employee had taken a photograph of my card and used it later in the night at a casino  miles away from where i was workingwhile at my place of employment i received  an alert moments after the card was usedthe card was in my pocketi notified chase and they immediately cancelled the cardthe service from chase was stellar and this action was imperative in preventing additional fraud against my accountthank you chase for protecting my account and my accounts integrity,1
this app is suppose to be convenient however every other time it doesnt recognize my iphone s plus i have to constantly request code to activate this app it is extremely annoying and frustrating would not recommend this junk,1
overall good especially the quickpay function but sometimes forgets the mobile device and need to enter activation code multiple times,1
awesome awesomeawesome awesome,1
every time i log in chase says they are unable to recognize the device each and every time i need to request an identification code each and every time the touch id never appears to work i have enabled the touch id but the setting get disabled once i log off expect a much better app from a reputed bank like chase,1
wont let me log on with my correct username and passcode tried redownloading it didnt help worthless to me,1
overall the app lets you do your banking with a few taps at most  taps to complete a task so i was driving the other day and i was using quickpay dont try this in your car hope they allow customers to make changes soon like the stuff you can only change on chasecom,1
does what you need it to do enter up up down down left right left right at title menu for unlimited money cheat code,1

while it is nice to have this on the go it only helps if it works consistently i have updated software on my phone and had to uninstall and reinstall app multiple times even still often when i go to log in it looks like its working then just shuts down and goes back to home screen its not a username or password error i have had those big fingers little keyboard but it just shuts down please work on making this app more functional,0
i am a loyal chase user i updated the app on  i just wish i didnt once it updated nothing works on the app i cant delete or open the app i even tried restarting the phone to see if that would help please fix this soon thank you,1
good app very helpful well designed fingerprint recognition makes this app very convenient,1
cuxxkfaurdofitftajgfyo,1
ive had this app for a long time now but now i cant log in for crap i have to request a code every time i log in the same for my wife we only log in from the same two phones all the time you should recognize them by now,1
i love this because i can always see what my balance is and when my payment is due so i dont forgeteasy to use,1
this app has great features like setting up payments days in advance viewing all transactions viewing my amazon rewards balance etc,1
when you have a thumbprint option to log on you shouldnt have to input your login code to pay or move around the sitewhat a jokelearn from amex,1
the app can be very useful and i would rate it much higher except entering my password can be a huge pain in the butt not to mention having to change my password to make it so long i cant remember it the requirements are a bit ridiculous you need to have x amount of characters upper case lower case symbols and so on not only that but ill enter my password repeatedly once to sign in and then again if im on a new phone or device and over and over sometimes ill have to go through this so much i want to throw my phone against a wall youll enter your info correctly and then itll say its wrong five times and let you in the sixth time this happens just about every time i use the phone and i go slowly and make sure im not accidentally dialing a wrong password or hitting all caps sometimes it wont deposit e checks or just wont work the app could be so much better its just very buggy i use it for convenience by then its so buggy its inconvenient if they worked this out theyd have a nice useful app,1
awful app if you like wasting your time try depositing a check it will take you hours snapping photos and entering amounts repeatedly returns errors on top of that chase limits the number and amount of your deposits on some random formula if you like mobile banking youll need to go somewhere other than chase amending this  most checks now go through but youll pull your hair out trying to deposit an out of state check had a state government tax refund check that the app refused to accept,1
i dont care for the new graphical display at the login its nonessential and adds a little to the load time but not too muchupdate  now the login time has greatly increased and switching screen to screen is uncomfortably slowupdate new update is forcing chase freedom ad which since its appearance has broken the touch id prompt,1
called chase three times spoke to three different agents even though they said my apple pay card was activated was not able to take advantage of their one time offer for my free download of eric claptons album on may  last agent transferred me to another agent in online support not realizing customer was on the phone rudely replied we dont troubleshoot for that when first agent went forward transferring the call to her the rude agent put me in the queue for a survey rather than taking the call bad move chase guess how i answered that survey question  precisely what ive come to expect from millennials who are lucky enough to have a job piss poor entitlement issues,1
im very disappointed that these people still havent found a way to allow their clients to log in with their thumbprint like one can with amazons app do they actually believe that a thumbprint isnt as secure as having to enter a username and password,0
very easy to use app i have used chase for years and having used the app for years i rarely need to visit a branch downside is i cant mobile deposit my paychecks but in all fairness i cant use the atm either something about the spacing of the numbers at the bottom also dont have full access to change payees or autopays in the app but that can be done at chasecom other than that fantastic,1
impossible to deposit checks,0
this iphone app continues to crash when its launched i thought the recent ios update might fix it but no such luck when it works its great but i cant get it to work for my iphone,1
since my earlier review and multiple app updates the interface has become very userfriendly and appealing to the eye in addition to adopting the pin code signin system thanks for listening chase also im obsessed with the locationbased homepage images i am always pleasantly surprised by and like to see the images update to the cities im traveling to at the moment ,1
doesnt recognize my password and then doesnt recognize the id code sent by text logged in ok on my phone ui that i can see is very basic easier logging in through website and i can access all i need there,1
every single time i attempt to log in it claims not to recognize the device and forces me to request a new identification code even if i had logged in  minutes beforehand its an extreme hassle that i cant seem to fix and it only does it on my cell phone,1
i loved this app but now im unable to use it or redowload because i have io and extenuating circumstances wont allow me to update please create option to dowload older version,1
i have the touch id set up to sign in to my account on the app and every week or  i try to sign in but the touch id doesnt work it makes me sign in with my password then when i use my password it says i need a verification code long process whatever it is it needs to get fixed,1
i like that my roommate can transfer rent money to me without our accounts being linked,1
enjoy banking on my mobile however whenever i try to log in always get the message does not recognize the device i always have to get an identification code over all great appthank you,1
its easy to use the finger print reader to open the app and view accounts to move any money or pay any bills through chase which rocks too you have to enter your pass code i like this easy to use app its helped me stay on top of my budget,1
im blown away that this app has almost  stars i hate this app literally every other time i open it i have to sign in and wait to receive a verification code to login to my account all this after ive already turned the touch id option on i always make sure its on so that that the next time i go to open the app i dont have to go through the same hassle never fails though i have to do it all over againevery single time its a major glitch that has yet to be fixed,0
i can see my balances ok but nearly every time i log in from my phone it says my device is not recognized and i have to get the code there used to be the finger print option and thats gone too  and i know i have secure messages but when i go there in the app nothing appears  very frustrating,1
i prefer the old way of going online through safari but that has been stopped due to not having the most updated safari system for my ipad i guess  so i was forced to get this app which ive been using now for a while but its very difficult to find which account is amazon and which is slate,1
so far i really like this app a lot and that says a lot because i also use usaas mobile banking app more to come,1
touchid login doesnt worklogin in unusually slow with the passwordthe notifications badge gives the impression of notifications yet they cant be located within the app or cleared by viewing anything thus the badge annoyingly lingersif i login with my password or miraculously with touchid i have to input my password again to make a payment good call keeping out the thieves wanting to pay down my balancewithout contest chase is the worst finance app ive got,1
why do i have to pit my username and password in to get a notice that i have to update the app and then have to log in again to the updated app it should tell me its out of date right away and save me logging in twice these time wasters add up in a day and we waste our lives doing meaningless stuff because lazy programmers please fix,1
i like how i can change between personal and business accounts  all under one username and password,1
i am very happy with the chase mobile appit is very user friendly  great app ,1
works great and really helps me keep track of expenses and refundsfingerprint id works well,1
i love my money and this app lets me see it i love my money and this app lets me see it i love my money and this app lets me see it money,1
i love to use this app to keep track of my spending history but lately the app has been a pain in the butt i cant log in anymore and even after i logged on it crashes on me  of  times,0
love this app easy to use and feels secure when you choose to add a second identifier code,0
love this bank and love the appdue to the fact its simple and easy to navigate with and never crashes ,1
no matter how many times i log on i have several security hoops to jump through each time i understand the security need but the app becomes inconvenient when on my cell phone trying to go back and forth to enter the long security code number,1
my only financial app that still requires a full password no numbers no code no fingerprint technologytoo long to loginthats why i cant rely on chase,1
whats the point of using touch id if youre not fully authenticated why touch id and password you may as well just use password both amazon and usaa use touch id to fully authenticate you and im pretty sure their apps are secure,1
i like this app once im logged on and using it my one issue is that each time i use the ipad app it does not recognize my computer and i have to request a text message to get a code for log in this happens each and every time i use the app,1
 update i am still having the same issue as before and no one has contacted me or commented on my review am i the only one with this problemat this moment my phone says we dont recognize this mobile device i am still having to verify my devices regularly i did another update to fix the bugs today yet right now i have to verify my device can something be done about thisdown to two stars nowthis app does everything i need it to it is close to real time lets me see each debit or credit lets me know whats pending l can deposit checks directly from my phone pay bills transfer money wire funds all of the things you expect from your bankhowever my biggest issue really the only one but it is so irritating regularly  times since january st to be exact  on my phone or tablet it will saywe dont recognize this mobile deviceas a precaution we need to verify your identity before you can access your accounts please request an identification code to help us identify youi then have to select text message get the text and enter the codethis happens on each mobile device i only have two but i should only have to do this one time on each why is this happening this is annoying please fix it i will gladly leave the  stars that this app would be worth,1
app makes me request a new identification code every time i login because it doesnt recognize my device ill turn on finger id login and every time i log off from the app itll reset i guess and require me to request a new code and manually login again,1
useless app cant do anything without entering a password after biometrics hello i used my own fingerprint to get into the app you make it less secure demanding a typed password every time i want to actually use the app i assume app either extremely insecure or too lazy to if nothing else code for secondary biometric validation to be safe ive deleted and assumed app is junk and unsafe,1
it works but it keeps unauthorizing my phone and i have to log back in manually instead of with touch id and resend the verification code almost every time i use it,1
not sure how i kept all my banking straight before bank apps but i am sure i wouldnt want to go back to doing itlolhaving this app is more than worth it saves time stress and money helps keep your money safe because you can catch in seconds if there areany mistakes or unknown charges i still use my check register but having the app makes it all so much easer and efficient,1
i liked that the app is right at my finger tips and that its for the most part accurateit has some glitches when opening the app at times and sometimes closes or wont open overall i like this app and the things it allows me to do when it is working,1
with lawn mowing skills hi i am lorne a professional lawnmower and have been lawnmowing for over  years if you need your lawn mowed with my own lawnmower then call lorne the lawnmowing mower at  oh yeah the chase app is great,1
great application,0
i used touch id to log on to my account and after a while touch id is disabled and i get a message that says we do not recognize this mobile device i had a verification code emailed to me i used it then i was able to use the app again then after a while the same thing happens again and i have to request another verification code this keeps happening over and over again  i keep getting the same message and i have to keep requesting a verification code  even though its always been for the same mobile device,1
i use this app daily it suits my needs and is very user friendly the check deposit feature is great just wished it would take check amounts greater than ,1
love the app ive banked with chase for about  yearsrecently moved to where a chase isnt the closest to me so the app helps me with online depositing without driving an hr into a town works for my needs,1
always seems to run smoothly and the touch id feature is awesomeif you have chase this app is a must,0
awesome,1
very convenient app easy access to my accountspay my bills transfer money to my son,1
love this app just wish there was a chase bank in the city of coachella ca ,1
wow,1
super convenient amp great tool,1
very useful i use it all d timevarious times a day sometimes,1
superb app only wish my account had more zeros at the end  ,1
i hate that when i really need it it tells me that i cant and have to wait or it will message me a balance but when i check its not as much ugh,1
its an awesome app it makes checking your account easy we enjoy using this app,1
the reason im not giving  stars is that i am not getting a prompt for iphone touch code and my login pw isnt autofilled for logins,1
i like the app but i dont like having to use an authorization code to login when im using the same device all the time,1
i hate to get the code each time i get into itit takes time to do that i love the check deposit per mobile its so easy  i think its a good site,1
i really like this appbecause i could make my payments on time  transfer  from my saving to my checking also transfer  to my sister account,1
this bank has been good to me and my familybeing out of the military and trying to handle life again is hard but they have help so much to get my back  i am greatfulthey have been there more than i can say,1
i use it all the time and now with touch id  stars all the way,1
works well with checking your balances or pay some bills but when you get a new checking account it has a tough time doing anything with without going to chasecom or actually going into a branch,1
great application easy to use  can do almost any thing from the phone,0
there is nothing i cant do with this app and smartphone when it comes to my personal banking agenda good by to waiting in line the bank,1
it is a good app it is relatively easy to navigate the application i did have one issue that was very annoying i had to download the app three times and the chase manager had to change my password equally as many times to correct the problem when chase sent me the link to download the application everything went very smooth right up to the point where i was asked for the elec code and password i requested for the passcode to be sent to me via text and three times it stated that the code had been generated and sent to my phone and three times i stood waiting several min to no avail finally we decided to request the code to be sent via email i did not wait more than two seconds before it arrived successfully had it generated so quickly via text the first time i would have rated the app with  stars i hope someone looks into this issue as most often many of us are in a hurry to get things done especially those daily activities we consider chores and it can be agitating to have such things not go smoothly as expected thank you jeanne b ball,0
good app functional and reliable improvement could be made when entering digits for bill pay and remote deposit should be able to just enter the digits and have them appear right to left and have the decimal stationary for instance enter  and have the digits appear as  gt  gt  gt  i have it on my keybank mobile app and love it thanks,1
really a great app overall very simple and easy to use i really like the touch id option to login so you dont have to write your username and password every time you use the app,1
can you add features to redeem points for chase amazon card like in chase credit card please,1
title says it all ,0
great,1
helpful,1
i dont really enjoy this app i have to enter my password every time i am passed off to another area of the app or i should say when i am sent to your webpage i want to do everything i can do in chasecom ,1
i am a very forgetful person so i constantly have to change my username andor passwords for my online accounts because i end up forgetting it if i dont use it that often the touchid is amazing because i dont have to worry about ever entering my login credentials also love that i can just swipe to the right and view my account balance very very convenient ,0
ive had to request a code x in  months because they did not recognize my phone called and complained to chase they claimed they have not heard similar complaints before,1
every time i try and log into the app it asks me for an identification code this is very frustrating as i should be able to log in with touch id or my password and each time i try to do so chase has to text me an id i called support and they said this is a known issue and that there was nothing they could do to help me at the time,1
this is a good banking app that continues to be polished improving the overall look most of the functions you need are in the app while others are still accessible on chasecom,1
i love chase great bank great function where i can photo deposit my checks but in the past month i am having problems with my touch id and balance preview i have to go to my settings to turn it on again and again i am also having to verify my devices both my iphone and ipad which is a pain because i have to wait for chase to send me a verification code by text and then reenter it  hope you can fix this problem its a bit annoying  is anyone else having this problem,1
this is an excellent app and i manage my checking ac and credit card using this appvery rarely i login via computer to chase portal because most of the tasks are accomplished through this appthank you,1
love it,1
awesome,1
this is the best app that i have seeni can do anything that i need to do and much moreds,1
chase customer support had me uninstall then reinstall but still fails app says i need ios  or above and i have ios  but app cannot id ios version chase says it it apples fault no plans to fix by chase update  chase has abandoned iphone  customers since they cannot run ios ,0
i use the app to deposit checks for my business and the monthly limit is just  dollars can chase increase the limit to a less  thanks,1
i use it to buy things from amazon makes it easy,1
try depositing a check after entering username amp password requires an id code get that from an email then enter id code and again enter password then enter check data amp photograph  minutes start to finish frustratingly slow but faster than a trip to the bank,1
i use my fingerprint to access but it constantly asks to enter my username and pswd thats very annoying,1
simple to use would prefer being able to use a digit code rather than password everytime i log in simple and easy app to use,0
love how easy this app is to use no hassle just quick and too the point,0
the app is easy to use and very quick to set up payments the card is even better and who doesnt love points to amazon,0
i used to be able to finger scan to get into the app but now it has be back on writing in my username and password everything else works great except for that,0
this app has performed flawlessly forme i rate it  instead of  because they spoiled me with touch id and later took it awaythat was so very convenient,1
this is my first time with chase  the app seems okbut what bothers me is that it seems not to utilize the information entered in the online site  i set up my online several days before downloading the app  i registered my cellphone online as my mobile device  butthe first time i tried to log in using the app it didnt recognize my cellphone  then when i asked it to send me a text with the identification code the only number options it gave me was my home phone duh and an old office phone number that used to belong to my ex duh duh  who knows where it got those numbers from  ive never had that happen before  fortunately the email option pulled the correct address but this experience makes me a little nervous about using this app,0
i especially love the fingerprint sign in it really makes using this app even better seems like im always having to remember a password and username these days the chase app is easy to navigate and is organized very simply it is to the point and doesnt give me the run around,1
use uber code sararue for a  free ride,0
horrible ux on ios i cant login with the app anymorefunny the error prompt says ios is supported but chase doesnt realize thats untrue sadly the app alerts are the only thing that survived and no way to clear the counter please fix,0
the app is amazing so you can transfer money and other stuff from your phone the small issue is that when youre connected to wifi in some other location it would ask you for a security code overall the app is amazing besides that flaw but is reasonable that they should ask you something like that when youre connected to other wifi terminals,0
it helps when i need to make sure everything is ok with my accounti really like the print accessibility so you dont have to type in a security code to log in to the app itselfit has its minor glitches but for the most part its cool,0
convenient,1
i just left bbampt after ten years because i tried chase for one year had enough of the other banks crap chase has newer atms which accept cash deposit and when i charge something chase is less than  seconds till it sends me a txt letting me know this is the main feature i like  touchid the other app didnt even have it lol  hello  got my wife a separate account this way i can send it money works good i like it,0
keeps asking to put in a code every time i log in its frustrating and annoying if you have the app it should allow you to get in with user name and password,1
it is incredibly convenient you can check your balance deposit checks transfer money between accounts and a lot more if you bank with chase there is no reason to not have the app i have not run into any issues for an even easier way to check your balance you can sign up for quickpay free and text bal to  and you will get an automated response with the current balance for your enrolled account there are more commands that you can use but i forgot them you will receive a list when you sign up back to the app though it is great easy to use works with touch id no reason to not have it,0
very good apphelpful,0
simple yet innovative,0
no real change so it lost a star fix this and you might get it back  a very good app but no one has paid attention to these complaintshappy to have an app it feels more secure that httpswe have an old account that is long since closed it is always the first account and adds extra clicks to get to the real alerts a direct entry to the alert or a drop down would be an improvement,0
i have been using this app for  years now and for me its smooth runningit is so easy for me to view my accounts make deposits transfer money and pay bills it makes banking with chase so easy and convenient thanks,0
this app is a wonderful complimentary extension to all the other features of chase chasecom the inbank experience etc kudos to chase as an org for thinking through and delivering a great and consistent customer experience across all platforms and through all channels  well done,0
love it but since ive purchased my new iphone the app doesnt recognize it i know it has to do something with privacy in safari i was only able to log in a couple of times the correct way other times its with the special code,0
very professional,1
i have been banking with chase since i was  im now  so what does that tell you only  problem where i thought they were helping when i had an auto draft that i cancelled turns out they were still able to take money from my account chase gave me the funds back but turned around and took the money back with no warning at all and no explanationwas not happy but i still love chase ,0
wish the feature to log in with your fingerprint worked for this app not sure why it stopped working but i use this feature to log on to my american express app and its so convenient its also annoying that when i log in from my phone and it says this device is not recognized and makes me enter a code in order to login i just want to be able to quickly log into my account take care of what i need to take care of and log out other than that the app is great,0
awesome,0
the interface is consistent with the chasecom account website so it is easy to use and familiar my one disappointment is not having touchid enabled for logging in and having to login manually every time i use the app,0
i love the convenience factor being able to deposit checks find nearby banks and transfer money are all great factors the app can be kind of buggy and randomly shut down it asks for an identification code when the account is logged on from a new device which is a great security feature however it asks for an identification code for the same devices consistently,0
awesome,0
as the title says it allows me to do everything i need to do on chasecom need to cancel a quick pay payment a few minutes before it goes through the app does it seamlessly looks just like the website as well kudos to the dev team and chase,1
its like a chase bank and teller at your finger tipsgreat app,0
awesome,1
great app but i am constantly having to get a verification code sent to me to use it very annoying and time consuming,0
i love the app its so easy to log in manage and pay on accounts however it only works  percent of the time typically i use the website which is a pain because you have to request a code then log in again using that please fix,0
this chase app keeps on asking me for a code because it didnt recognize my devise every time i use it and do i have to set my settings to do auto preview and finger print security all over again every time i use the chase app it used to take these settings for the  devices i set it up with this is something chase app developer need to fix please fix this feature,0
amazing app i use it on the daily and it helps me when i need to pull money out of all my other  accounts thank u chase,1
love this app,0
excellent bank app with finger print amp code entry  easy to use keeps you informed with bank alerts up to the minute on my ip sethanks for the improvement  jim,0
pretty good so far excellent and professional designlets see how it charges,0
when u thought ya had financial adversitychase is there chase cases tm,0
gotta love chasebank five stars in customer service,0
i have used this app for over a year without any issues  recently however that has changed  at random moments after typing my username and password to login to my account the app kicks me out  there is no rhyme or reason as to when or why this is occurring and as a result makes this app unreliable,0
i have used other banking apps and this is by far the easiest to use and you can do just as much as chasecom,0
this app is far from accurate i dont know what type of positive reviews these people are talking about but i figured the point of checking my balance in the app was to get an accurate view on the money i currently have boy was i wrong if any normal person see that they have  dollars in their account go spend  come back home and the app shows you just spent  dollars so you have  left in your account however any normal person isnt going to expect to wake up the next day with a balance of  that would mean that somehow the idiots in charge of posting transactions on this app cant keep up with your purchases therefore you get to get punished for going overdrawn and not even knowing and also you get to pay a nice  fee my point is if you download this better get ready to do some math and track everything you purchase rely on this app for your balance and youll be in for a rude awakening that is all,0
i am very happy with app it makes my life easier organizedalso i like it when i deposit my checksa lot of time saved,1
i always have my touch id on but every time i open the app it always says the device is unrecognized i have to enter a special code that i got thru text message then when i go to settings my touch id was turned off somehow i turned it back on and after a day or  somehow it got turned back off again and i have to enter a code again just to see my account so inconvenient and very annoying i never had a problem like this with my citibank and amex app,0
awesome,0
useful for checking balances and paying bills however the app lacks the power of other bank and credit card apps like discover chase forces you to use the website to setup parts of your account or to add a new payment option ok open safari and go to chasecom however it routes you to the mobile site with no option of a desktop version and the mobile site lacks the same functionality as the app,0
no matter how many times i use the device the security never remembersrecognizes the device so i always have to ask for a access code,1
 ,1
im very annoyed by the fact that app will constantly pop a message stating temporarily unable to connect so than i have to go online and login that way where it will require me to request an id codei have deleted app reinstalled app and remains the samevery annoyed,0
just like the reviewer before i have been asked to review the app many times so here goes i also use fingerprint recognition but before i can i am frequently told i am not recognized and i have to get a code this always happens when i am rushed and is hence even that more inconvenient the app is kinda slow and in general is better than ok but not great,0
this app takes banking convenience to a whole notha level what can it not do except take actual cash deposits lol bombcom,0
when moving money from business account to personal account money leaves business account immediately but it will show up on your personal account three days later i called their  to ask why the mobile application doesnt let me deposit using photo check and was told the reason is because i am banned from using it due to an overdraft i had in the past which was caused by what i explained above on which they also charged  so they caused the problem charge you for it and then shun you later not a fan of chase anymore,0
app is great other than the fact that i have to request an identification code every single time i login,1
excellent app i highly recommend it has saved my butt many a time even when i was abroad very convenient and easy to use,1
the app is very useful saved my butt several times,1
love being able to call out my wife when she drops  at banana republic,0
five stars the user interface is nice the app works reliably and doesnt crash it supports touch id and mobile deposit,0
love the appbut so tired of looking at these people that show up on my phone every day lol please change the photos in the  ,0
this app makes my life so much simpler im able to check my balance transfer money send quick payments to my kids instantly pay bills and even make some deposits  up to  no more sitting at my kitchen table for hours writing checks just open this app wherever i am and with a few strokes im done truly banking made easierjust one little issue why have a fingerprint id if i have to type my id again to do anything,0
astonishing,0
app works well except if you setup itouch it constantly loses the setting then it doesnt recognize the device and we go back and get a  digit code reenter the code and password go to settings and turn on the itouch to have it work  times and then we start the process over ugh  please work on this itouch works on other apps with no issues what is the issue with my the chase app i know others that have same problem,0
i like the ability to see all my transactions going back as far as i want to  just keep scrolling however when i had to retrieve my forgotten password by the time i got the email with the code to log in it timed out on me before i could reset a new password   times in a row so i finally just had it send me a text which was faster but they could stand to extend the timeout function a little bit,0
awesome,0
love this chase app,0
its great app i love it if some people has problem with it  it seems to me they have problem with their internet connection either cellular or wifi its convenient to do on line banking over the phone  very easy to deposit your cheeks instead of going to the bankthe only thing they need to improve is their reward program  in order to redeem the rewards you have to access through your computerother than that its amazing,0
loveit,0
everything is great except you cannot find your account info ie account and routing number or swift code of your branch through the appotherwise works great,0
booking travel is so easy links with amazon too,0
this is by far the most well thought out design for any banking app ive encountered i really like the fact that chase was thoughtful enough to have a popup number keyboard than having to go back to my phones number keyboardthe internal layout is smart i just have one little request for us ole seniors please make the letters and numbers bold i had to use a magnifying glass on several pages especially the page for creating your password even with a magnifying glass it was so dabburnnet hard to see with the glassalso got iphones please allow us to use our fingerprint id other bank apps do you need to get with the current times people my fingerprint is very secure its time to grow upplease make this improvement for everyonevery respectfullyjim i,0
great app,0
the functionality of the app is easy and does what it says  my only problem is that ever since the last update about once a week the app doesnt recognize my phone  thus i have to get a code texted to my phone so the app will recognize it  this problem has occurred on prior versions and on prior iphones  but the frequency being once a week is getting to be a bit muchupdate that has now been fixed  the new version is great,0
great app easier to use than boa      but more difficult than others needs some work should color code bill pay activity as it is on computerized model otherwise easy to follow and instant gratification a plus in getting things done,0
awesome,0
love this app and its capabilities because there are some many functions available the programmers did a great job making it simple to navigate and find what you need very impressive that almost everything you do on chasecom can be completed on this app very convenient,1
eliminate the need to enter your password for certain functions like bill paying after you have already used your fingerprint to sign in this is over cautious imho the addition of being able to view a check is one feature i had previously requested glad to see it was implemented otherwise its a great appstill have to enter your password despite having already scanned your fingerprint why bother using fingerprint authentication,0
very convenient,0
its very easy to navigate and very useful the only problem is at least once a week the app will tell me that it doesnt recognize this device and i have to request an identification code in order to access my account again its not too difficult just a little bit of an inconvenience but other than that teeny problem its a great app,0
not much difference from a mobile site same limited capabilities but the site didnt ask for additional wedontrecognizethisdevice code,1
great app does the job well but you always have to be careful on the phone not to press something twice or mess up but great app for being on the road and taking care of businessbl,0
im so thankfulit is easyhelpful and i love it  because i have peace of mind with this app thanks so much ,1
this is a good app overall except for the fact that every now and then it does not recognize my device my touch id will not activate and i must sign in with my password and wait for a code this has happened several times and is quite frustrating my device is not new its the same one ive always used since first downloading the app this is clearly a bug that really needs to be fixed,0
its not a bad app just not a good one either a lot of button pushing to find out basic info that should be easy to see and get ive got an amazon card through chase and its obvious they cobbled info together on the app,0
this app is awful makes you get a security code to login in every time i have a username and password why do you need security code every time  also its very time consuming to try and do anything on this app besides look at you balances it seems like they make using cash back points on credit statement impossible to do  not happy with this app i see room for major improvements,0
simple to use concise makes life easier and control of credit a snap,0
every time i attempt to sign on it says that it doesnt recognize my mobile device and sends me a new identification codeid give zero stars if i could,1
app is very easy to use for my amazon rewards cc notifications are good and quick allows me to see my points transactions and make quick payments,0
needs fingerprint recognition,0
this app is better than my other banks app,0
i have b of america amp citibank accounts nothing compares with the versatility of chase mobile app keep up the good work chase,0
hate this app have one for wells fargo and never had a problem signing in and with this one every other time we do not recognize your devise please request an identification code and i have to wait for a text before i sign in i use the same iphone,0
awesome,0
love this app and the ability to use touch pass code to log in just wish it had more features like you would if you were on a desktop or laptop computer overall  great app,0
logging in every time it requires a identification code,0
overall mostly great,0
i prefer to keep all of my records in one electronic payment service with a few exceptions i track all of my monthly bill payments through my bank who also receives my bank statements and makes it easy to locate all credit cards and schedule patients to income on one app it is not quite this easy with the chase app especially if my primary bank is not chase we live in a community where mail is delivered at the street we have had trouble with mail being stolen or scattered on the street for this reason we have nothing of value come to our mail box i had chase setup to receive statements through my bank and chase credit cards paid through our bank using cbilling however if i schedule a payment through the chase app it will appear on my statement but is not recorded or able to be tracked by ebilling with ebilling i can instruct my bank to make a minimum payment a current balance or any custom amount then if i want to see all payments made to chase freedom unlimited or chase amazon i can easily create and print the report from my bank app with multiple cards from chase amex capital one etc it is more convenient to use one bank app than juggle each card with the card app finally when asking for help it seems that credit card representatives understand how to use their app but have no idea if they have a relationship with a specific bank to create a much more convenient ebilling account lastly there is a game of skill that comes with every credit card and its called reward points not only do you need to be on top of your game when seeking the best price your have to know enough math to figure if youre really saving monet or just playing the game i didnt consider this in my review or else id only give a high score to the card that guarantees you the best price and doesnt make you jump through hoops to get there fortunately im a retired engineer but i worry about my grandchildren almost all of whom hate math we need a college level math course called something like consumer math or reward point mathematics,0
i have to keep getting requesting identification code because it keeps not recognizing my iphone kind of annoying,0
everything is ok it make it even more unlikely that i will ever step foot in an actual bank i just wish i didnt need a code everytime i try to log in on a different device i understand why,0
i opened up my account with chase right before i started college last year after a really bad experience with the harris online banking i downloaded the app still skeptical of not being alerted in time and possibly over drawing my account to my surprise it instantly shows most transactions even those still pending so you can see what money you have remaining its user friendly my checks are always partially cashed right away so i have money to use and chase quick pay saved my butt while i was on a business trip and harris froze a card and i had absolutely no fundsi think its great for everyone but would definitely consider if youre in college with books and bills to pay for consistently just have many bills in general and definitely for parents thinking of doing a joint account with a teenager with a job its a great way to build responsibility,0
like it its very easy to navigate amp get things done i especially like the way you can see your balance wout user nameamp password im often trying to check it while busy or driving so its handy but dont ask me to rate it again for a long time it gets annoying to see that pop up all the time it should be noted that i did rate it today ,0
i like that it has the thumb print capability that i dont have to type in my code to view my accounts dont like that the alerts doesnt give you much information,0
there are two major problems with this appfirst the touch id turns itself off all the time for no reason  i have touch id on everything i can and this is only one i have trouble withsecond it constantly tells me it doesnt recognize my ipad and iphone and wants to send me a code  wth  get it togetheri can see if im using some different wifi it doesnt recognize but when im sitting home on the same network ive always had its just a big waste of time,0
i like the way the app works but any time i power off or restart im required to get an access code from chase  this is beyond annoying  also have problems with the fingerprint aspect  dies work properly using it with my ipad and iphone,0
use app exclusively to monitor credit card transactions one improvement would be the ability to add a pay from account without going to chasecom,0
i find the implementation of touch id annoying why do you trust touch id to access the account but not schedule payments why is it that sometimes i need a code and other times i dont need a code to login,0
what isnt chase get up to speed with everybody else and start using touch identification so that i dont have to type in my password every time all of my other financial institutions have this capability bank of america american express identityguardcomcome on chase,0
every time i login for the past few weeks it doesnt recognize my mobile device and i have to request an identification code one day i logged in three times from the same device on the same wifi or lte and had to request a code all three times i called chase and they said it was a known issue and to try to uninstall and reinstall it well ive done that twicestill not working bummer because ive  had the app for years hope they get it figured out,0
great app when i can get into it its constantly asking for a verification code that they have to message me creating  different screens i have to pass before i get logged in,0
everytime theres an updateits like starting over have to request a new code to register my ipadthis is x now also have to redo touch sign on  please fix this,1
the app has made some really nice progress and love the speed and details in the alerting capability but i still cannot understand why you have yet to partially mask the saved username with asterisks on the login screen like every other financial application security is important and the less information visible is better will up the rating when this happens,0
update july discover app is much easier to usei check my balances on my credit cards and checking make payments transfer money via quick pay check my messagesi enjoy accessing my account so easily no problems to complain about iphone +,0
this is certainly one of the better banking apps available in speaking with patrons of other banks i always ask why dont you just do that with your app you cant ew ha i especially love the deposit features but i would like to be able to message customer service andsubmit proof to disputed activities etc via the app as well this feature also isnt offered via mobile web version of the chasecom site thats why i cant give it  stars,0
previously i had posted the following the app stopped recognizing my phone one day and never worked again unless i request a code that ironically is sent to the phone it wouldnt recognize i called chase and they told me they cannot help and that i should contact apple about it im trying to get hold of tim cook  right after posting this as if by magic the app started recognizing my phone again coincidence or chase actually reads these reviews so i love it again in summary the app is great other than the problem described that was finally solved,0
app provides account balances quick pay activity easy to maneuver and take care of account activities secured if accessed on any other devicesget what you need done quickly and securelyonly thing i would like to see is a search option for deposits and debits,0
i recommend this app very convenient and simple to use i have amazon credit card through chase,0
whats the purpose of touch id if you keep asking me to put my username and password in manually,0
this app is easy to use easy to understand quick and straight to the point  i love using the text chase option as well  if i need to know my balance i set up my texting option in the app or chase online amp i simply text  and text bal and it lets me know my available balance in the blink of an eye  this app always allows you to use quickpay wire money process checks with the snap option contact chase with phone s and more  i highly recommend using the app rather than going to your browser  hope this helped,0
app not as user friendly as usaa their mobile deposit is much easier to use as camera does work for you deposit limit a day yours is ,0
the app is fair easy enough to use but with fingerprint id in effect since ios  the is no excuse this app cannot log i with it,0
for some reason it asks me very often to verify the device im using even though i always use the same device so i have a verification code sent to me and go through the motions but this happens at least once a week sometimes every time i open the app and its very annoying,0
great,0
im already logged on and see all my acct info using touch id then i click pay my bill and it asks for a password wth  safe to assume it is designed to hinder convenient payment clever of them probably rakes in a few extra million a year in late fees,0
great app use it all the time,0
this app never recognizes my password and requires me to request an online verification code every single time i tired calling chase and they told me it is an iphone problem but i do not have this issue with any other apps very very annoying,0
intuitive easy to navigate,0
i have the app but am required to get a code each time i log on i tried to pay on line but got a message saying i need to go to chasecom to enroll i am already enrolled,0
this app is very convenient especially when trying to access account from a new computer since you never have the time to request a code and authorize a new computer,0
a must app if you are a jp morgan chase fanmakes your banking a lot easier and funsimply awesome without a doubt,0
i use this app to make payments on my amazon credit card and without a doubt the best banking app i know of,0
ive been a steady user of the jpmchase mobile app for years it updates on occasion and over the years it has changed for the better to help cater to my wants and needs  im fairly capable around computers but this application is smooth enough for anyone to use computerfriendly or not  it shows me my accounts straight away as well as listing any outstanding balances of cards on the same screen i can access most features of the chasecom website straight from the app as well as choose actions like transfer funds between accounts request information on credit cards and gives me direct information for contacting chase as long as i bank with chase im going to proudly use their mobile application happy and secure in the privacy and protection of my personal informationthanks chase,0
this banking app is the best,0
i simply love the convenience of this app and the fact that is reliable  of the time which you expect from a bank,1
i was glad to have touch id id be even happier if it didnt turn itself off regularly whats the point of having this feature if i have to use my password every other time to reactivate it and when i have to do this the app never recognizes my phone so i also have to get a security code im just going to keep touch id deactivated it takes more time for me to sign in using it than not i hate it when companies waste my time,0
i use this every day multiple times a day to manage my bills and see how irresponsible ive been with grub hub quick pay is unbelievable because my ious and outstanding payments from friends have been reduced by  and something asked me to rate the app and im bored sohey,0
this app would be great if you didnt constantly ask to be reviewed,0
this is one of the apps i use on an almost daily basis i like the functionality and cross over design of this app with how the chasecom website works as well the only thing that needs to happen is a redesign of the alerts interface the screen only presents one account at a time do you know you have an alert but you have to click through each account to see where not a deal breaker for me still love this app,0
love iteasy to use,0
i have one suggestion to the developers i also bank with capital one and their app login procedure is much more convenient i simply swipe my finger across the dots in a configuration of my choosing my chase username and passwords are very long so its a hassle to login the swiping motion would be so much easier i would love to see this option added and then the app would be perfectby the way i love the scenic picture on the login page so keep that,0
dont make me enter my credentials twice almost every time i access this app i have to enter my credentials and then im forced to update the app it should be the other way around once ive updated which i have to do or i cannot access the app i have to reenter my credentials just program the app to make me update before i enter my credentials aside from that glad i can access my accounts most of the time on the go thanks i hope a developer from chase reads this review  ps i know its important to have us update the app but when im out and about i may not have access to wifi using my cell phone data is kind of frustrating when i could have updated on a wifi network  over a year later and this is still an issue come on guys update  chase app still asks me to enter my credentials and attempt to log in before forcing me to update the app  then i have to reenter my credentials please  just make me update the app when i open it why do you make me waste time entering my credentials twice,0
does what its supposed to do love itnot sure about the security but thats there with all bank appscan include tons of more features that are there on chasecom,0
like the chasecom website this app has significantly improved as well  with both you can check the balances to all your accounts and make transfers and payments all online without having to get out of the home or office  excellent all the way,0
i have  banking apps with  different banks and this one has got to be the most annoying one out there i have the amazon credit card powered by chase and it is always such a problem for me to get around the app itself it also really annoys me that once youve given it your thumbprint it asks you for your password to make a payment why for security reasons sht if they already got in w the fingerprint let them pay my bill its not a minor annoyance i really really hate that,0
great app no issues on my endsimple and easy,0
goooddd,0
after this updates i cannot use touch id anymore every time it asked me to enable it again i enabled it several times still requires this on login pagealso right now every time i login i need to use verification code its really bad user experience fix it,0
after mandatory update on  the app does not accept mobile deposits these are checks i have deposited in the past w no problem  it wasnt isolated there were  amp it wouldnt accept any of them bad update,0
as of  the app is not working for depositing checks the pictures for the checks a clear and readable but the app says it isnt i tried over  different times with different lighting still doesnt work i used wellsfargo banking app on the same check and it was deposited the first time this is the worst version of this app,0
everything about this app is great,0
i am completely over the required updates i cant use the app nor the webpage on my devices because they require updates my devices cant do so i am supposed to run out and buy a new device every time you send out an update i am over all the updates and want my devices to run the few apps i use if your programmers cant keep up with the code they must write without requiring and upgrade in my os every time then i guess i will find another bank i cant give no stars or i would,0
great apps and so smooth to operate thanks,0
very user friendly and easy to navigate  my only issue is that since my wife and i both use the app for a joint account it seams as if every time one of us logs in on our iphones the other persons iphone gets forgotten about and they have to send you a code to access the app  its not that big of a deal but it can be annoying,0
every time i use the app it makes me create a new password i just logged in to pay my bill heres how it went enter user name enter password password not valid its the one i created a month agoclick forgot passwordenter entire ss enter chase credit card error msg chase does not recognize the device im using my iphone request id code choose email text or phone call i choose text choose between two phones they have on file for me my home phone or the iphone they just said they dont recognize i chose the iphone error msg this feature is not currently working choose email text or call i chose call choose between the  numbers they have again i chose my iphone i get a phone call with a recorded msg telling me the  digit code i enter the code create new password i must enter a password twice i enter the same password i had before invalid you cannot use any of your  most recent pws i enter my nd choice twice invalid i must have used that recently i enter my rd choice error msg idle time out im logged out and must start over click forgot passwordenter ss then chase card  error msg applicationxwwwformurlencodedapplicationjsongot texthtml i have no idea what that means another error code idle time out again start over ss chase  text the code enter the code create new pw enter twice the pw i was trying to enter when i got booted last time invalid enter my th choice twice successit shows me my balance its lower than i thought i consider paying the full balance off but st i want to check my budget against my other bills i only have  unpaid bills i open the apps to check their amounts takes about  minutes i go back to the chase app error msg idle time out i try to log back in my password is invalid i have to create a new password enter ss chase  etc if i pay the full balance i cant pay the other  bills its tempting i dont want to have to go through this one more time but i did the responsible thing paid what i can afford and made plans to pay off the balance next month and never have to deal with chase again,0
 of the time this app forgets who i am amp i need to request a verification code via email at login multiple times a day sometimes within minutes of my last login with a verification code,0
everything is good but at some point i lost ability to use touch id to login plus i need to request an identification code each time i used to go to the app more often not anymore,0
i was struhgling with accessing my monthly statement to pay its balance on my desktop and had trouble then i remembered id obtained the mobile app on my iphone s i opened it got the code via my land line just like i wanted entered it and my password and from there a piece of cake great timesaving and effecient app that does exactly what you hope it will do,1
im sure this will not deter any one from using this app if you bank with chase you kinda have to its been pissing me off lately every time i log in i have to change my password after the touch id fails that is it,0
wish you had fingerprint identification have better luck now with website on my macbook hope next time app recognizes me amp i dont have to get text code,0
well i just finished writing a pretty good review of this app but apparently the original username i chose was already taken so it told me to choose a new user name no problem but made me write the entire review all over again so im knocking this down to two stars i originally said that this is a pretty good app and it had done everything i wanted it to do including deposits transfers and bill pay if it makes you start all over again from the beginning just because one minor problem thats a very poor design,1
every time i try to log on it requires me to request an id code i have to wait on the text and then enter the id code and then log on because it says it doesnt recognize my mobile device ive tried deleting the app and starting over and it still does it its very annoying and im not sure why it doesnt recognize my phone after logging on dozens of times from this phone,1
the worst aspect is that chase is in bed with apple and doesnt make its app backwards compatible with older iphones like s and s kinda forcing you to upgrade if you want to use the app     also after signing on correctly it may not recognize your device then after sending a code to say your em address it doesnt merely ask for the code but makes you sign in all over and add the code     but when the app works it works very well eg for viewing transactions and depositing checks,0
difficult to login i enable touch id and it always requires me to reenter my password then says it does not recognize my device which is the same ipad i always use i then have to receive a text message code in order to login way too much trouble,0
dont bother downloading seriously the worst app ever always asks for a security code almost every login its seriously aggregating please fix this issue,0
why dont you guys add the ability to create a recurring payment such as a monthly payment the only thing i see is a onetime payment then tried to access the full chasecom to do the payment from my phone and i keep getting redirected to the mobile web site which also lacks the ability to make monthly bills this is ridiculous and frustrating no way to go to the full site fix the app and there is no need for people to go to the web site,0
i used to love this app but now i hate it it always ask me for a code i hope they fixed that issued cos i will delete it,1
i used to really love this app but now every time i try to log in it asks me for an identification code cause it doesnt recognize my phone this gets pretty annoying,1
the app crashes every time i try to do anything except open the app if i try to make a transfer between accounts it crashes if i try to schedule a quickpay it crashes it worked fine before the latest update please fix,0
after updating everytime i try to use bill pay it crashes please fix,1
every month you want to pay bill  every month you update  chance your username doesnt carry over and you have to wait until you get home to reset password  chance you forget to do that oh amp  weeks later,1
every time i go on the app its asking me to verification code each time i log in it doesnt save anything i have log on like it my first time everytime,1
the app always had some quirks with retaining the lastused username as well as functionality of quickpay now however there isnt any support at all for ios  in the touchid feature,1
i mainly use my chase mobile app to make quick deposits  wow  the hours of my life ive saved traveling to the bankatm to deposit checks is stacking up to the hundreds  seriously that feature alone is worth  stars the app is reliable gives same info as full site and has a great user interface plus itll remember your username  its the little things,0
really dont get why theres so much haters on this app reviewpros simple quick amp convenient mobile check deposits work  of the time transfers are no hassles rewards points can be cashed out redeemed for gift cards used for shopping or pay off remaining credit balancecons some links are buggy or load slowat the end of the day theres nothing but wins here mark  machkeys,1
easy to use and understand very convenient to have my account info available everywhere i goupdate still love this app easy to use and very reliable results every timeupdate  use this app all the time and its a seamless positive experience every time love itupdate  still use and appreciate this app thanks chase,0
every time i want to use it i need to get a code and put my password aging  i already update but still doing the same thing,1
thieves,1
very easy to use its easy to manage accounts and pay the credit card billand its easy to redeem my rewardsi recommend it to my friend,1
this app is awesome ,0
truly best all around bank around been a customer for  years  whenever i had any trouble it was cleared up within as soon as possible  this app is just icing on the cake easy to set up one touch instead of typing in pass code every time  check balances pay bills  transfers credit card accounts and the rewards program all with touch of a finger get it and enjoy like the rest of us do ,1
whatever the hell you did to the credit card transactions is super annoying you should have left it the way it was i dont want to have to search through statements i just want to see it i hate the new update ,1
only complain isthat in the middle of the night i work midnights so thats when im using this app most days it says it cannot recognize my device although its the only device i use this app my phone and i have to wait to get a code text if i logged off and logged in again even within the same  mins it would make me get a new code so annoying,1
love the app but the fingerprint pop up is a bit slow to show sometimes ill just manual type my username amp password when the pop up is too slow to show,1
i dont like the fact that i cant rotate my ipad and look at banking info can only look at it long ways also why the big typing all other apps are normal let me pay bills on one screen  going back to old fashion way chasecom can do everything at once,1
once again the dream stuff up department prevailed over the common sense if it aint broken dont fix it approachnow when comparing charges to my credit card from one month to the next i only have to pull up debitcredits by billing cycles rather than just simply scrolling back as far and as fast as it took to compare now i must try and recall the exact billing cycle that it occurred in and pull it up does the dsud actually use the apps they get paid to create omg i just went to lookup a previous statement transaction i now only get a microscopic statement that i must dig through are these people required not to use what they create i guess i will have to see if southwest airlines has another banking card this is ridiculous and stupid please create a minus five star ratingi now get a cutesy notice saying that the app only supports one chase account per user name so i must answer the dumb question of do i want to change it to another account answerof course i do otherwise i would not be putting in another username which prior to the improvement it use to do automatically my solution will be to payoff and not use the second card so as to make my life simpler as it was prior to this upgrade dont take me wrong im all for well thought out upgrade improvements to the app but this is what happens when the dsud does something solely to justify their existence,1
awesome application seamless,1
i love this app i use to often it works great for me,1
i love the app  except every other time i log in it tells me it doesnt recognize my device and i have to request a code to be sent to me,1
awesome app,1
the touch id gets disabled for nothing for a very long time probably until the previous update every time i log in it would text a code to my phone and i would have to enter the code and re enter the password which was very annoying especially if you have a long complicated password,1
really useful practical design my only criticism is having to log in a second time whenever theres a secure message isnt the app secure with my initial login being sufficient,1
check statement almost everyday best and easiestway to check bank statement also has my chase cards on statements updated sept  ,1
this app is awesome i use this regularly to keep up on my accounts i love how it attaches my  credit cards under one username making it easier to manage in  place,1
i love this app i use it multiple times a week very easy to navigate and extremely user friendly sometimes the touch id for the iphone turns itself off and you have to log in with a password and verify the account with an identification code im glad its a secure site and chase is taking security measures but when youre in a hurry this random glitch is frustrating,1
the ap is good bit every time i try to open it it tells me that do no recognize the device even though i use my iphone or my ipad so they send me an identification code which is ok for our own security but it does it every time i use my ipad specially,1
i love ittttttttt ,1
great,0
love this app has been the best most used app to dateim able to do transfers see my accounts send money pay my bills without a problem i have no complaints totally give it five stars,1
still love it l everything works for me perfectly love it love it love it no problems what so ever thank you thank you thank youlove this app thank you and you have made my banking easy thank you again,0
everyone in my family has a chase account and my mother and my sister normally call chase to know the balance on her account which is a lot of workanyway i had this app since last year and i love it i check when i get my direct deposit its much easier and way fasterwhen my sister told me about the quick pay on this app i was very excited i then introduced this feature with my bestie that nice we spent sending each other money for no reason,1
pretty good appnot bad at alleverything is fairly user friendlyworks like it is supposed to,1
very nice and stable app,1
what more can i say i am delighted as heck that there are smart intouch people out there who are to setup and maintain this kick butt app to make my banking needs convenient and applicable,1
i found the app extremely up to date and very user friendly i tried to make a st time payment and couldnt i thought it was an inconvenience at first  then realized its great security chase is st class,1
every time i attempt to login to my account it tells me it doesnt recognize my device then i have to request an identification code i almost always use my iphone to access i never have issues with recognition on other bank or credit card accounts,1
ive used it for years and saves me a trip to the bank they just increased the deposit limit from  to  so i never have to go to the atm perfect no bugs perfect reads i can do transfers and quickpay love it,1
convenient works great,1
app has great features but only drawback is touch id not working often and still asks identification code if it is fixed then definitely it would deserve  stars,1
i dont know what happened but the app now makes me request an identification code every single time i login  its extremely frustrating,1
i really like the convenience the chase offers including depositing checks over my iphone i like my thumb  print code dell,0
had to come up with username nobody came even close to using this one very brief compared to laptop clearly download in progress wrap up whatever i was trying to accomplish with wifi wait to find outlet it download since pretty much frustrated enough already so get it over with unwanted junk requires restart option  hunt down most illogical hideyhole you stuffed it in to delete this trash somehow convince machine incapable of thought do not ever try downloading this ever again by any means have i yet established true aggravating alternative this fast harmless moment of time you get to choose for yourself do now or is it really worth it to become aggravated at all,1
very good app but if u have multiple accounts and u pay bills make sure u select the correct account the fonts are a little too small for me and it cost me  keep your eyes open,1
this app is falling under my protective jewish framework chabadorgthe young man freeman is more than ready and able to if given the fair chance demonstrate how to penetrate areas of darkness and loneness and give you cartoons too to illustrate sensitive issues that may need garment layering i caught this concept of review that immediately available as a time out to scan if the general consumption or public can stomach the material this too is an error code your dumbing down concepts of each is a member of the universe field understand you have optical damage you have auditory damage lack of central processing system and you dont have equal lanes you must go public with your knowledge as best as you could make sure you dont ever say that she is because once you do human limited yourself to being buried or cremated or thrown in the river or ocean in a plastic bag or straight in dumping style you want to look into arts entertainment which has the steps for you to open up like lil wayne explains to you hes more than humanrasha ayad mekhailramid infused in my brainwaves which has threads and other descriptive tools to link back to me personally not my family not my country i have no god it is to go back to meet back to me thats what were trying to do were trying to get each and identity that will never be penetrated or taken away or reduced or diminished and if we dont know how to do that we run the four corners of the earth flat thats the bmw run flat system which is my brainwave so if you currently have a bmw and it doesnt understand is youre not part of my team we need to start waking up so we can talk openlyupdatemy today wednesday september  i continue to be impressed with the potential that has enabled the computer end what i call information technology specialists within jp morgan chase bank na there is strong evidence that my retina infused with my specific solo id has managed to reach something that may have understood something is wrong within our universe and this needs all on brain duty to note observations and attempt creative methods to link the connections together so an underlying uniform bit binary  platform becomes universal standard assembly usa,1
i am waiting for finger print login all my other banks have this feature except chaseits pain in a to enter password every time in phone,1
very convenient,1
id touch always works amp im constantly checking my balancenever had any problems with the app they also just made chase quick pay easy to setup and use works great for me,1
my wife and i have to constantly request an identification code to use the mobile app  very annoying,1
awesome,1
i especially like the quick deposit for checks allows me to get my paycheck as well as keep the original for recordkeeping edit notifications of some sort would be nice without needing to fully sign in i think there may be a privacy layer there thoughmaybe give a general message like a transaction has been flagged or pay your minimum balance or else edit still great keep using it more features and sorting are very helpful,1
very convenient,1
have to brag about their incentive to open a personal checking acct i got the  they promise  where can you find something like this only on chase good job chase ,1
overall it is a good all the features needed are present love the touch id integration but there a few improvements also need a better search function for pending and cleared charges it is difficult to determine if charges are against a current bill or previous billalso need to see what the statement balance be and what the remaining balance is against that statement as many times people are making multiple payments against a single statement vs one large payment the deposit check via camera feature is nice and works but seems to be lagging behind other banks suntrust has the same feature but it will automatically take the picture for you notifications are lagging i would like a notification whenever a return is made to my credit card,1
i do love the app it is so convenient to access all my banking information i can transfer funds too one problem i have sometime is the touch access does not always work and it is turned on also if i use my ipad to access my account i have to get an identification code each time,1
i have an amazoncom visa through chase and this app makes it so easy to track my rewards points its also very easy to make payments and see my statements havent had to go to a chase bank yet,1
i like it  i use it  it works for me,1
this app logs you out every time theres an update  i have set my settings so i  can see my balances if i swipe right however  it always logs me out and then i have to get a secret code to log back in and reset the setting  its  extremely annoying,1
this app has allowed me to cover my butt several times for the most part to delivers what it claims every once in awhile it does not work for reasons im not sure twice to be exact otherwise love being able to handle my business as it develops from right where i am id recommend,1
easy fastwonderfulthanks,1
i love everything about this app but i do wish they can add swipe code where you can create a design to log in instead of putting your password all the time but other than that i have no complains,1
as an employee of chase i do love this app and how it works especially the new atm access code feature,1
love how amazon rewards credit card has an app now makes it so much easier,1
as being the preferred btch of many creditors chases app is by far the best its easy to use and you literally get any info you want regarding your accounts at your fingertips without having to call a human being unlike us bank ugh,1
awesome app i love quick pay and how i can transfer money from my savings to banking and vice versa i also pay my freedom credit card and my car payment all from this app,1
its workingstill workingim workingim sleepingits working,0
i usually have no issues with this app and i love it because everything was so convenient however as of recently ive been having a few issues that i hope the developers can quickly reconcile every time i launch the app i have to request an identification code because for some strange reason it doesnt recognize my device which has been the same for years when i log in and enable my touch id then try to log back in i get an error message telling me to log in and turn touch id back on again it is becoming very annoying to have to put a code in each time i want to log in please can you correct this issue asap,1
ive had this app for years but these past few months it has been constantly saying that it doesnt recognize this device and i have to request a code almost every time i use the app it also disables my touch id setting when i enable it its so frustrating to have to re do these things every time i want to use the app please fix this,1
works well enough would like to have touch sign on as an option bofa and wells has this featurefyi,1
ill rate an app if i like it without without being pestered pester me and youre a  star app you want better then act like you deserve better,1
now i cant see back in time at all on the charges  please put it back to the way it wasthis is way worse to see info and navigate than the old one and all the ios versions hurt my eyes with the whiteout youd think programs would get better and better but no they are getting worse shame on you,1
i have to reset my password each time i log in chase makes you constantly change your password making it hard to remember which password is the correct one the process to change your password is ridiculous chase ask for your social full credit card number a text code plus new password has to be elaborate with special characters and all this non sense all the time i will try to make a purchase and chase will deny it and text me asking if my card been stolen the security with chase is so much its very annoying it should not take  min to log on to check my credit card balance pick another bank avoid chase,1
user friendly very accuratelike it,1
i do like and use it only for amazon one month my due date may be th then next month th,1
it wont log on  of the time it says chasecom is unavailable but if i open my browser i can log in through the website then it wants an update then it works once or twice then chasecom is unavailable  ill just use my browser thanks,1
i love having access to my account  with just a few clicks its so secure and asks for your password when doing different things to verify its you if you try to log in from a different place than usual you are sent a code that you have to put in i love that extra security feature this app is a must have if you bank with chase,1
very easy to use app on it all the time i use my amazon chase card for everything to get the points,1
the app is awesomeeverything in one place,1
as a married person my wife and i both have a chase credit card capital one app has a thing where you can save  accounts which is very easy to access you dont have to erase and put the other persons username it will remember both usernames from both accounts capital one app also has touch id to sign in these are very convenient features that i would like to see for the chase app please implement these features to make it easy for us thanks,1
love chase bank in every aspect the app works great once you can get logged in we love that we can see all of our products at any time the location finder is quick easy and effective one major issue ive noticed the past few months is that every time i log in on my cell it requires me to request an identification code every single time even if i log out and log right back in its very frustrating,1
i love this appits quick and to the point you dont have to jump from page to page to get to the info you need thank you very much for fixing the bugs that use to bug me,1
excellent,0
about half of the time the app doesnt recognize my device my son has same problem have to get a code to type in which is very annoying went to branch to ask and they didnt know what to do,1
awesome,1
great appdoes everythingtruly outstanding app,1
i recently downloaded this app to make payments from my iphone  i did not have my username and password as i have forgotten them it was easy to rest the password and i was up and running in less than  minutes   i will check back once i have to make a payment from the app,1
overall its a fine app the only thing that bothers me is the identification code we have to put in every single time instead it should be a short code that we already know also the app doesnt work a lot of the times,1
love the ability to use atm with a mobile code generated from the app instead of a debit card,1
need fingerprint recognition,1
chase your doing a great fcking job  keep it up,1
it works just fine my biggest gripe is that you have to enter your password instead of having a mobile code like other financial apps have,1
it would have  stars except that i got spoiled with the barclaycard app  specifically the fica score they alert me when my score changes and i can view it whenever i like unfortunately they show only one score  chase could blow past them by offering all  and maybe an annual credit tune up  but those are suggestionsthis app does everything else very reliably this is one of the first things i look at each morning  to keep an eye on my money i have it set up to notify when any of my cards are used and it does i can be online with amazon or out to eat with my family  it doesnt matter  i always know instantly when a charge is made on any account i have a few accounts to separate personal funds and one nice credit card for amazon points between chase amp amazon finances are easily managed and christmas is practically free the only good letter f word i can login with my thumb  i like that but you dont have to use it i can see all deposits or withdrawals and when they are pending vs cleared i can see the full balance including what is pending and the available balance  so i dont spend what isnt cleared yet i can see previous monthly statements for all accounts i can apply for a loan online  chase recently refinanced my auto loan from toyota at a much better interest rate and they gave be  off for each of automatic monthly payment amp payment is from my chase checking so that was a half percentage point off and brought it down to  from the ridiculous double digit interest that toyota was charging overall the bank and the app have improved greatly over the years i almost left chase a few years ago for a credit union  but i kept money in both for a while now chase is doing better i didnt mention above but i applied to both to refinance that vehicle the credit union offered worse terms than toyota well played chase  well played,1
i havent had many problems and whenif i docontacting customer support with a series of questions which i find to be great for security reasonsthere has been a few annoying times where i needed to know my balanceamp could not log onespecially weekendswhich is when you need it the most i believe  obviously when you spend mostampthen cant contact a humanreally only reason gave starsplease update that,1
somehow when it updated it delete and re sets your login pass code n touch id then u need to verified everything again,0
i really dont like this app i find it has very little utility and is more of a transaction log maybe because my safari browser is set to private it never remembers me and i have to be sent an access code with each use overall i really do not enjoy using this app and avoid it whenever possible,1
great app overall but i wish that every time i went to use it i didnt have to go through so many steps what should be a quick check of my account takes around  minutes after my touch id turns itself off and i have to ask for a code to be sent to my email and then i have to enter that code just to log in when i was just supposed to be able to use my finger i know that in the long run its not a big deal because i know that at least my app is secure lol i just wish i could use the convenience features lol,1
would be perfect if i didnt have to get a identification code every time but i guess its for safety reasons,1
ive used this app for years with no problem and it used to be extremely reliable now i cant  even log in without having to get an identification code much less use the touch id ive even deleted and reloaded app and it still wont let me login without a new id code each and every time,1
i thought it was cool that when people quickpay it went straight to my account until i was trying to cancel a payment it no longer allows you to cancel because the money goes straight into the account of the person you send it to which i do not like i miss the older features that asked if you wanted to cancel,1
i initiated the touch id feature because im always forgetting my password it used to work but now i have to set it up almost every time i use the app then when i try to reset my password the instructions to set up the password just dont work i always end up using the phone application to make a payment im very disappointed with this app im going to pay this card off close the account and just use my amazon store card,1
i am no techno geekin fact i am a little computer illiterate however this app is easy to navigate and practically idiot proofthank you for making banking easy,0
i have a job where im not home for weeks at a time and only usually have access to my iphone i tried to make my first payment through their app but it told me i have to go to chasecom to set up a pay from account when i go to chasecom i cant force it to go to the nonmobile site to do this so now i have to wait until i get home which could be weeks to get my account current i could call them with my checking account info but i shouldnt have to do that i havent had this problem with any other credit card ive ever hadi also tried sending them a message through the secure message center but we are only allowed to read and reply to messages theyve sent us we are not able to create new messages theres no good reason for this restriction and none of my other apps present this limitationmaybe it will be worth more than one star after i can actually make payments from my phone but right now the app isnt allowing me to do anything i would like to dothis credit is only a temporary need for me so ill probably close it once the  intro apr expires,1
this is the best bank interface applications that i have installed on my iphone  i have citibank chase american express wells fargo sams club amazon etc  theyre constantly updating the app adding new features etc  ive never run into any problem yet nor has my data been compromised to my knowledgei recommend the chase app without hesitation,1
i love this bank amp i love this app the preview screen is genius the only issue i have is deleting the messages after i make payments its difficult and i usually wait until i go on the computer to delete them  stop asking for a review ive already given you one,1
im not sure what happened  if it was an update or its a glitch lately this app is failing to recognize my phone  and will keep having me enter a code and remember this phone it never used to do this now it does it every single time i wanna preview my balance and i always need to reactive the option to preview its getting pretty annoying ive never had an issue with this app before ive had it for years must be and update,1
needs fingerprint login needs revamp  amex and bank of america mobile apps are easier to use and navigate,1
i love itit comes in handy when i need to check my transactions or balance and send quick cash to a relative,1
ii is so difficult to deposit a check on this app like no other from other bank especially from wells fargo this one is so good that im thinking to quit chase end move my accts to wellsjust because the simplicity of that deposit on chase i have to try few times before i get it to work it used to be very good but after all this updates is getting worst end worst on wells fargo app just focus the check end scans it just like scanner no bottoms to push just fuscos the check end the app dose the rest like proupdated it keeps asking for a review every time i open this app this make it worse,1
works great very easy to use and very convenient i just wish there was a chase bank closer to my home in modesto ca  i have to drive across town to go to the bank not cool would love the fingerprint identification the only problem is i used mobile banking to deposit a check of  that i needed to use in about an hour it took  hrs to post an i had an emergency not cool,1
super easy and convenient btw my title was due to a recent geico  commercial i just saw super funnyif you have amazon credit card or bank with chase get this app,1
i love being able to pay my bills from my phone for free even if i wanted to pay my brother  chase writes the check and mails it for me or use chase quick pay and no check needed great app,1
this is a great app i use it all the time  i like the on line depositand the security of the app,1
touch id randomly turns itself off  doesnt recognize my device have to request a security code fix this please,1
i use this app to pay my bills transfer money to my other accounts or to my family thank you chase bankmakes life so much easier,1
this app has made mobile banking so much easier i love that you can access it with just with touch identificationeasy to use quick pay or transfer money my only complaint is that sometimes twice it logged me out of my account and my password didnt work which was my actual password it then says too many attempts have been done and when i tried to change my password meeting the password requirements even with a telephone banker it still said it didnt meet the requirements and i had to go into the branch for them to reset it thats the only flaw i found in it star rating for that reason,1
update   it does have fingerprint access so thats good its not a bad app but i still think boa is my number one banking app need the fingerprint access feature added because i dont like to enter my password every time i need to check my balance,1
when i first downloaded this app years ago i was able to deposit checks i thought it was awesome but then i kept getting a message saying there was a problem they never fixed it its very annoying maybe theres a problem with iphone it worked fine with the  but not with the  or  otherwise its good i like the new updates but i still cant deposit from my iphone + frustrating,1
awesome love my chase mobileits let me know of any deposits that hit my account or any amount that taken out i cant imagine being without it its that good love it i love iti love this appi believe everyone should have this app on their  good thing to have,1
i like the app however when i send money to my grandmother its so hard to explain to her how to go on to accept it would be nice to do it from the app instead of go online get code enter code login accept go view it would be nice to send money she gets notification and accept maybe adding a password so when you go in app press accept money enter password and be done,1
so the latest update on  has been installed and now i cant get on the app anyone else having an issue,1
excellent,1
the app works flawlesslywould recommended to anyone,0
this is by far the best app that i have in my phonelove it,1
great app buti have lost track of how many times ive had to reset my password i can get in  times then it will tell me my username or password is incorrect ive gone into several branches over the  years ive used this app to change my password  trying to change the password yourself is not userfriendly but ive finally figured it out,1
awesome app helps you send money via quickpaylets you deposit checks online,1
keeps deleting touch and preview always ask for code never use to do any of this,1
love the bank and all branches do not like the app bad feature of this app is you cant use multiple iphones i have  iphones both have the chase app every time i switch phones and use the app i receive a message that this device is not recognized i then have to receive a text or email identification code to use it again  major painjim,1
chase bank was already a great bank before i had a smart phone i down loaded this app and chase bank became an awesome banki have a poor memory due to two tbis received in the military i can easily look at allmy transactions thanks for everything,1
i appreciate your hard work to help me to keep track of my spendingthis app is truly thegreatest thnksim very happy with all of the functions and information found in the chase app i use it every chance i get to keep up with my use of money spending and deposit into the account thanks,1
awesome,1
v sufficient,0
very convenient and very secure,0
easy to use quick and accurate i love depositing checks from home and transferring or sending money in any place and at any time now theres an option to receive a code via the app to deposit or withdraw cash at select atms without using a debit or check card awesome,1
i agree this is the best chase app ever  chase app has cash back rewards when using freedom credit card  chase cash back rewards has the best options you need the most on amazon places to shop or dine outneedless to say more as you go along with chase banking online be glad you find chase app well,1
overall is good in the future can you add pin code login its so much faster also if we can pay with cash back towards monthly payments thatll be great,1
i love the app its very easy to use and works great the only thing that i really dont like is the fact that its always saying it doesnt recognize my device i constantly have to get the silly text with the code just so i can check my balance please fix this,1
good app for me  easy to navigate and does all i need  what else more can i say,1
good,0
i like how easy it is to use no really big problems one of the best apps ive used   still one of the best ones,0
best most useful and convenient app in the world i love chase bank because of how great they are and the chase app is nothing shy of amazing,1
makes it easy to keep track of my accountlove it,1
for the most part its good but needs to have following changes   add touchid button icon somewhere  add more features eg ability for ach or wires not just domestic  make app simple like capitalone or ally bank app   ability to change displayed items by user and  add security level add on for  use secondary code like google authentication in case ur traveling or other for higher security,1
the app works well the problem with it is if you use chase on multiple devices i use ipad iphone and windows laptop you constantly have to verify your device usually when i am in a hurry so you have to request a code get the code and log in with the code this happens on my iphone and ipad at least once a week this did not happen with early versions of the software,1
great iphone app easy to use easy to make payments i love it,1
i have been using it for long timeit is very helpful and convenient ,1
touch id to log in so so dont have to remember another username and password easily manage your accounts from your mobile device makes quick pay super simple with other chase bank members the alert system preferences are great great app,0
awesome,1
everything is great with this app except for when i have to login everytime i sign in i have to request and identification code from the same phone i use everyday and it annoying plz let me know what i can do to fix this issue,1
ive been using this app for many years and i love itvery dependable very useful i recommend it,1
very handy to manage account with a simple touch i really liked touch id authenticationkeep adding features,1
great update with atm code,1
every week an error pops up saying it dont recognize my device on me and my husband phones so it have to send identification code ect we have done this so many times its getting annoying please fix it,1
terrible application smart and intuitive,0
chase continues to outshine all other banks with the best banking app on the market great time and effort has been put into the design each of the functions and the flow of information  and it always works like a charm i switched to chase over five years ago when this app first came out and it has made my life so much better no joke depositing checks from anywhere at anytime and now the new atm access code feature that allows you to pull out money even if you forgot your card is just genius i wish all old institutions including our government would follow in their footsteps,0
i reluctantly opened chase checking and savings account but was pleased to discover my existing chase amazon cc comes up in the same app with the new accounts im leery of big banks dont like the vibe at most chase walkin facilities but my local chase bank formerly wamu is a classic wood and marble hometown bank and the app works just fine  hardly ever need to go into town,1
great all around,0
app works well on ipad and iphone  with ios xx but with multiple accounts and push notifications app does not tell you which account generated the alert thus making user cycle thru all accounts to see what happened still cant print statement from app please fix,0
the app changes its strutting by it self and has locked me out numerous times the only thing worse than the app is the horrible customer service this company provides,1
very user friendly app functions great kudos to the developers  who removed the most annoying thing removed the extra step of imputing security code to use the quick pay function it works with fingerprint access now on the app i have no issues with chase onlinemobile service right now its great,0
this is a great app for depositing checks it saves a trip to the bank i only gave it four stars because the app only allows up to  per day for deposits our employer does not offer direct deposit so we arent able to use it for our paycheck which is a huge inconvenience having to drive to the bank im not sure why there is a limit when i called the bank to increase the deposit amount allowed per day they couldnt give me a reason why they could not increase it only that it was  a day,0
love my chase mobil apphas never failed me when i have needed to find out info on my accounts fast and reliable thats all i want,1
the chase app is ok but much like its desktop site the navigation is clumsy chase has historically been behind other banks and cc sites in most regards and recent changes didnt help not terrible but not very good either i dont know who designed and leads the chase app layout and navigation but they need to visit amex ebay amazon or dozens of other sites and note how they do it,0
awesome app can do everything from iphone love it,0
great app and very convenientall features work greatnever had any problems,0
update they upped the deposit limit that was the only think i couldnt use this app for before now its simply perfectoriginal reviewi use this app not only to transfer money pay bills and track my accounts it couldnt be easier i also use it to find an atm when i am out of town and need some cash its super easy i will echo the others reviews bout the notifications i want to see which account the notification is for and easier access to them thanks,0
i really like the app it is easy to navigate and gives me easy access to my banking information along with the ability to move money from one account to another i also enjoy the ability to make mobile deposits without having to go into the bank,1
has reduced so much of my banking woesvery user friendlyhelps me track my purchases and makes my statements easily availablegood app,0
i used to be able to give it  stars but lately its been continuously telling me that it does not recognize my device i keep having to get code texted to me to go into account reset my settings and repeat this cycle when i call chase they are no help and can tell me why,0
how useful is a nice gui if you cannot see your balancethen i checked back on chasecom an surprise they upgrade their system at  pm,0
one major drawback every single time i sign in on the same phone i have always had it doesnt recognize the device and has to send me a code that is time consuming and annoying i have attempted several times to have this rectified and it has yet to be solved,1
the app works fine except that everytime i log on it asks me for an identification code which is pretty inconvenient and annoying,1
i love this app its easy to use easy to navigate and it doesnt freeze or buffer like most apps do it gives you the option to save your username it will display said username every time you open the app all you have to do is simply enter your password and voila youre securely logged in great banking app,1
this app is super easy to use and makes life much easier when in a rush,1
very easy to use app much better than my other credit card applicationsespecially love that i can do the fingerprint to sign in,1
every time i go to log in it makes me get an identification code even if i have the thumbprint security enabled it wont work  says i have to request an identification code super annoying and takes way longer to log in wish they would fix this i do like the convenience of being able to look at my account on the fly and pay my bill easily giving only  stars because they cant figure out how to make the log in easy and efficient,1
every time i log in it says it doesnt recognize my device and sends me an authorization code,1
everytime i log in  its directs me to another page which i have to request an identification code  it should motive my device by now  so nerve wrecking,1
i use a total of  different bank appsthis is by far the worst the touch id does not work every time i go into settings and enable it would state that it was not activated i would need a code to be texted to me ever time i logon,1
pretty good except when a new version comes out the current version cant be used at all then the new doesnt accept touch id requiring the password again which then requires an  digit security code via text to authenticate the device not smooth,1
the app makes my life easyevery thing you want is on one page,1
they have you enter a nickname comments and then you try to send it thats when they tell you the name you selected is taken and you are r directed to the main app screen to start all over again all of your comments are deleted good money app bad review functionality,1
new and not so improved we took that clean interface you loved so much and f its s up with ads enjoy,1
good app does everything i need it to do such as showing me my valence and activity and i love the alerts just waiting for ios  update,1
cuts straight through to indispensable information about my accounts status,0
perfect,0
i dont like how the picture deposit never works for me i have tried several times and it always fails its irritating when im nowhere near a chase bank and need to deposit a check via phone but i do like the preview portion of the app as well as quick pay and i dont like how i typed a whole paragraph and since the username was already taken it deleted the whole review,1
very helpfulinstantly keeps you in check with your accountlove this app,1
very convenient,1
in the past two weeks i have opened the app daily and it has only worked once i keep getting then error code  unable to connect please try again later its really annoying,0
get your atm access code is an excellent example keep up the good work,1
i love the chase app and have become dependent upon it since the chasecom website upgrades sucks the one thing is alerts i am on accounts with my daughter and i want to be alerted if her accounts get low but all the other alerts she wants to have i don t care to be alerted it should be separated where she can set up the alerts she needs and i can set up the alerts i want on the same account by our personal id overall they continue to be the leader in the industry in bank technology,0
this is a clean and easy to use app though i wish i could sign in with a code or touch sign in on my iphone so that i didnt have to enter a password each time,0
since the last update the app is behaving so badly even when you select to login with touch id the app keeps asking you for your password at every login moreover it now requires a second code sent via text message so annoying this app is now mostly useless access the account from your computer instead,1
banks and good ios apps have never really gone together when picking banks the mobile experience is one of my key deciding factors chases iphone app is fairly good but not great the good news is it has a relatively clean ui  the slideout side menu could be organized a bit better my only major complaint is that they arent taking advantage of all the technologies and features available in ios  why dont they have a widget for account balances fifth third offers that and i think it is incredibly convenient to check balances without going into the app wheres compatibility for apple watch also why are some tasks like viewing my account and routing number or placing a travel notice for example totally undoable from the app and require using the website thats not userfriendly i also wish i could control which accounts send me notifications and which ones do not this may very well be something that is possible but i have to change on the website and cannot do inapp im not sureif they could add a widget for account balances that would make it a fivestar app alone imo compatibility with watchos the ability to do more tasks inapp  and perhaps some further optimizations and ui cleanup to make it more like chasecom would only make it better,0
update they fixed the issue with ease of making payments now theyre advertising to you since youre a captive audience offensiveupdate they make you enter your password to access statements right after youve already entered it to get into the appupdate having to enter my password to read their pesky secure messages that provide useless information that does not need to be secure is too much trouble honestly this is the worst credit card app ive ever experiencedyou have to enter your password again to make a payment after ive already entered a password to access my phone then another password to access the app i have to enter a password yet one more time to make a paymenttoo much trouble doesnt make me feel any more secure,0
the app is generally useful but with iphone  and  it repeatedly claims the device is not recognized and requires a security code be texted to login  calling support will have you uninstall and reinstall the app only to have it happen again  does not happen with any other app so is clearly a flaw in this particular application  this has been occurring for almost a year on two different phones so you would think they would have fixed it by nowonce you are able to log in it is a useful application,0
excellent app provides all necessary info without hassle,0
got the check scanner from chase and it worked fine for  years then i updated to el capitan and safari  now its just a paperweight spent  minutes on the phone with chase tech support and even they cant figure it out now i have to photo my business checks with the app to get them deposited its a pain in the a but it works,1
still loving iti love the application today  est,0
i only use it to deposit checks not sure if its used for other things but it deposits perfectly only issue i have is that i have to log in manually every time i use it so annoying especially because i use a long pass code,1
easy to use clear and organizedlove chase bank and this app,1
needs touch id i got a replacement phone and it did not recognize but it took  min to get a code  and by that time session had died but had to do it again  ui menus are not clear amex and barclays and citi are much more useable,0
this app is great and all but its really annoying to constantly have to request an identification code every other day then i have to set up my touch id again because it keeps saying that it doesnt recognize this device so annoying,1
i use to love this app but ever since the last update it doesnt recognize my device everytime i have to sign in ive uninstalled and reinstalled the app a few times hoping that would fix it but it doesnt everytime i sign in i have to request a code its a pain in the butt please fix besides that the app was great before,0
every single time i want to log into my account through the app it doesnt recognize my device and i need them to text me an identification code its annoying especially if you need to check your account more than once a day,0
you need to make it more easily accessible to find our account number i just opened this account and i need to find it and ive been all over your goddamn website i dont use checks and i have no statement because its a new account bank of america gives you the option to see it on their app yet i cant even find it on your website idiots,0
does not remember your device and forces you to wait for and input a code on top of your own password multiple times a day if you want to use the app also turns off touch id because it suddenly doesnt remember the phone the apps lived on for months,1
seems good so far,1
muy buena,0
i check my bank app so often i get sick of putting ink password and code i prefer the touch code if possible,0
very clunky app hard to find amazon rewards balance and track activity,1
love the chase app really dig how it lets me manage my money on the go bonus its ux is really pretty and super intuitive keep up the good work chaseappteam,0
every time i use it i need to request a code because it doesnt recognize my iphone everytime,0
i love the features with fingerprint id amazon pointseasy payment options i have not had any issues my alerts come exactly how i set them and payments post when i set,0
i cannot create an account without a code each time a request a code it is not sent to my email needs work,0
  review  i am giving chase mobile app  of  stars since it lacks the ability to do online trades if one has a brokerage account associated with the bank  suggest you review the excellent app schwab uses to do trades via smart phone  as for other activities such as checking savings money markets i give that aspect  of  stars,1
havent been able to access the app since the update forgot password section is not working either app worked great till the update pls fix thx,1
almost every single time i try to sign into the app it tells my that my phone is not recognized prompting me to have a unique code texted to me for verification ok the occasions where the app does recognize my phone it seems to forget that i have set up the touch id log in making me type in my user name and password no matter how many times i put the touch id setting on it always reverts back very very annoying,1
 still awful terrible user experience celery time i try to use it system is unavailable then i open a mobile browser and get in with no issues its astounding that a bank of this size cant get an app right,0
i wrote long and very complimentary review about app then after all that when i hit send it waited until then to tell my nickname in use this review shorter and if it does it again no review it should tell you before taking time for writing reviewprefer this easy app to going into driving through understaffed slow sometimes unfriendly staffed bank itself i have more than one bank app this much easier never a problem easier to log off also    they may want to fix review ability though i doubt many do twice like i am and certainly not a third time,0
ilove tgis shrrmrkdksnsn,1
this app works great if you are the only one using it but when two people try to use it from two different mobile devices it requires a code sent via text or phone + your password if the other device was the last to log in once your mobile device gets permission to log in the other device gets locked out and has to get another  digit code etc etc and so on i spoke with chase support and theres nothing they can do about itit would be nice if we could get two user namespasswords but thats not possible eitherchase should let its customers choose what level of security they want,0
i have been a chase customer for  years  love this app  use it daily to check balances highly recommend it,0
i love this app its so easy to use and navigate through i wish all apps were this easy to useupdate chase has now added touch id so i love it even more the only thing i would change is that when you log on after getting an alert you have go through your different accounts to see which one sent the alert it should alert to which accountupdate  the only thing i dont understand and dont like is why we have to enter our password to do any kind of banking when weve already done our finger print this is the only app that i know of who does this update i still love this app except for having to enter my password to do any transaction within my accounts no other bank requires password once the fingerprint has been verified update i still love the app but i still dont like having to enter my password in order to do anything more than look at my accounts  update yay they finally did away with having to enter your password to pay your credit cards or bill pay all you need is your fingerprint now i love this app update nothing new since last review still like the app,0
i have used this app for  yearsit is easy to navigate and understand  they keep making improvements very happy with it,1
i tried other appchase is easy and best one,1
im not sure what the deal is but every time i log into the app it doesnt recognize my phone and i have to request a new code ive tried to remove and reinstall the app ive tried setting the fingerprint recognition to see if i can bypass but to no avail once i actually get in its pretty good,1
love the app one recommendation since they are very secure focused is to have the username only show the last dew characters and asterisk the rest for security other apps like fidelity and others obscure part of username after inputted to protect thur user,1
there are few very activities you can complete on the app without logging into a web site and the password has to be straight out of davinci code to work,1
i have been using the app for well over a year and its very easy to navigate through except when i want to pay my chase freedom credit cardeverytime and i do mean everytime i press the pay credit card  option it informs me it can not be performed at this time and then i press pay again and it goes through very very annoyingother than that it is a great app,0
awesome,0
awesome,0
i love love love using the chase mobil appit is so easy  use so convenient so accurate amp helpfuli use it every dayor nite days of yr i have  accts amp can keep track of all of themdepos avail bals amp making transfers r really fast amp accurate i dont have  waste my x waiting in lineexcept when i need cashi specially love the preview portion of the app as well as the ability  transfer funds among my multiple accts thank u chase  a job well done kudos  making banking quick convenient efficient accurate amp simple  use i happily definitely rate this chase appfive stars amp more if i coulddefinitely  thumbs up,1
not a fully functional mobile version cant send wires annoyed by constant request for login code i get security and once a week is ok but sometimes does  times a day and finally the touch id turns itself off randomly otherwise its ok guys look into discover card app for some pointers,0
not sure why every other day i need to reauthenticate with a code on my ipad mini  understand security but there has to be a bug so it doesnt recognize this device,1
sometimes when dont feel like going through the whole chase telephone menu this app comes in handythe thought of a thumb print to check your checking and savings etc is like pie in the sky,0
overall i find the app easy to use and i can easily find my balances and transactions i only use it for credit card info and not banking my issues only revolve around login problems it frequently kicks out touch id and i have to actually log in this is annoying but fine except that when i do login it says it doesnt recognize my device though it is the same device i have been using since i downloaded the app over a year ago it sends an authentication code and all ends well but its annoying to have to do this as often as i have to considering that i havent changed devices,1
the app doesnt recognize my equipment and i have to get a secret code about every third time i use it  its pretty obvious the nobody at chase uses there own app  incredible,1
works like an effin champ,1
i did not want to give this a  star until they fixed that stupid issue of having to accept money when someone send it to you now they have fixed it and  stars,0
  y   y y n    nkn      n  n ,1
always forgets my phone i have to receive a code every time it forgets that i set up fingerprint log in  its horrible im seriously considering leaving chase so that i could actually have access to my accounts  i dont know what happened it use to be a great app  btw it was doing this with my iphone  and still doing it on my iphone ,0
awesome,0
i often have to reregister my phone because it thinks its a new device  when i touch the icon for sending me an identification code nothing happens i never get a code but if i browse around on the app for a while it must think im friendly enough and gives me access to anything i often get emails of secure messages but i cant find them with the app unless im desperate ill wait and use my pc,0
i love the ease of using the applove the deposit factor and fingerprint option jb,0
would be great if able to see monthly statements on the app also saved username should be hidden so that people dont know what it is just by looking at your screen,0
this app doesnt work good at all with finger print been have major problems with sign on to chase always asking me about code to verification who i am then finger print turn off all the time no one has help fixes the problem to must red tape getting tried of this app trash it,0
this app is awesome its simple to navigate and very userfriendly i can check my balances pay my credit card transfer funds to another account or another person etc this app really deserves the  stars im giving it i like that chase always asks their customers what they like and dislike about the app and website so they can improve them according to our wants and needsupdate   this app is still the best mobile banking app ive ever used,0
the info i need is easy to read and i dont really mind the layout of the app  the one thing i hate is that every time i log out i have to have a code sent to me because the app doesnt recognize my device  also i have many times activated the touch id and yet again it turns it off and doesnt recognize my device,1
i constantly need to get a code because it does not recognize the device  the finger print id also not reliable works one or two times and must be turned on over and over,1
i love touch id  makes this seemless except in the use cases when i do need to enter userpassword  could you please code to allow the password app to pass credentials to your app  i have  a  byte random password and it works great with the browser version  very widely used on ios  super secure but still fast access  thank you and great job,0
great,0
great,0
chase app is one of the best apps on the banking sectorkeep it up,0
solid app  reliable and welldesigned,0
this app is chingonnever had a single problem,1
the new feature of accessing atm without bank card does not work since the location is always off tried two branches and even when i was standing right in front inside or besides i could only get as close as m away thus never able to get the code,1
 if a fat man comes into your room in the middle of the night  amp shoves you into a bag dont be scared cause i told santa  i wanted a friend like you for christmas send this to everyone you care about including me if you get it back  times youre real          ,0
i miss not being able to scroll all my transactions with the credit card i would like to see that returned or at least be given that option i have recently been given a app for a different bank and now can compare i like that i can see each action for each account i have for chase the other app does not afford this same clarity i like being able to see more than my payment history,1
i have both mb bank and chase and i love this app its easy to use and i havent sent out a check in years i love how now you can preview your balance i recommend this to everyone,1
positive  ive had no issues with seeing my deposits and items paid showing up correctly and quickly since ive been with chase butnegative  within the past week or so i noticed something weird i had paid for a purchase online well over several days ago i paid with my debit card within a couple of days i checked my balance and it had increased by the amount paid for a purchase it was only amp and change i thought i had seen it in error then a couple of days the purchase amount showed up again now im going to have to be very watchful of chase processing,1
i said what what in the butt,0
the only thing i dont like with the app is when you have more than one device it keeps asking for the identification code each time you want to access your account that is so annoying ,1
the chasecom app loads quickly and gets me to what i need smoothly and efficiently  its uncluttered and easily navigable without throwing a lot of upsells and other stuff i have no interest in  im glad to have been able to rely on this app for many years now,0
when this app works well its great however i often have it tell me that it does not recognize my device or use the same phone every time i login but i often have to get a confirmation code to stabley st my phone as a recognize device its extremely frustrating,0
i like how it looks like after the updatesita user friendly and convenient,0
chases ap is the worst wish i didnt need it  every other day it doesnt recognize my devices and makes me have to get a code texted to me to log in will not store my finger print log in every other day makes me reset that it is defiantly not a convent ap but unfortunately the only one chase has  i plan on consolidating all my backing accounts in the next few months but because of this ap it will not be jp morgan chase,1
i love my chase app i really do but lately its been becoming a bit weird and irritating its not updating correctly on how much money is being spent from my checking account which caused to be overdrawn  i had to deposit money from my savings in order to not get a penalty and just now i checked and my balance has not been updated from this afternoon when i did make a purchasechase please get on it and fix this problem,1
very well designed love this appapp done right,0
ever since the ios  update every time i log onto chase i have to request a new identification code to be emailed to me as if it were the first time im logging on from this phone please fix,1
the chase bank app is pretty nice to deal with good features and all accounts are viewable payablenot much really to complain about,0
the chase app is very easy to use you can do everything on here that you could on a computer using the app is a lot easier then going on chasecom when youre on your phone,1
this is an awesome app a real time savertouch id works flawlesslygood work chaseneeds iwatch  integration,1
when i go to deposit a check there is a box for front and a box for back and a big if you were to add a comment saying that we should put a dollar amount of the check in firstly then i would not have had to figure that out on my own  i punch the front of check box about five times before i realized i was supposed to put in the value of the check so this is a friendly suggestion to add a comment,1
stars when ever i use my ipad instead of my iphone i have to generate a code the security is very much appreciated but annoying it should be recognized after  times signing in ,0
well tried to order checks using the app no cigar tried to access chasecom website using my ipad via safari to order checks no cigar  chase uses pop ups that apple doesnt like on the ipad,1
does what i want it to do,0
this app is so convenientthis is my visa card bank fast quick no problems for me make a payment in a flashputting in my password takes longer,1
every time i log on the app tells me we do not recognize this device please request an identification code this app used to let me log in with my fingerprint not anymore even when i go into settings and authorize my fingerprint it wont let me use it now it crashes on me constantly wont let me make transfers because its unavailable and i swear to goodness it better not ask me for an identification code again,0
update  their online transactions are jumbled and not sorted by date whats up with that otherwise the app is cool utilizing the ios design this app provides simplistic features and information i especially like the simple and unique gesture to the customers saying good morning and good afternoon message whenever u login one simple ask is that based on the credit limit available if each credit or debit transaction provides the the total balance  along with the transaction amount in a smaller font it is much easier to review and verify the expenses i hope chase considers this humble request,0
i am so disappointed by the changes in the cash back police at chase you get very little of your cash back that youve earned if you spend it on amazon the customer service at chase is the worst ive ever dealt with would not recommend chase to anyone awful awful awful,1
the app is cumbersome and frustrating in that it never recognizes my device iphone and always requires me to request an identification code,0
this is a great appone of the easier ones i have used you wont have any problem with it they have thought of everything for you,0
it started out as a pretty basic banking app but now things arent working i figured out how to find out what my account and routing number are but the bank doesnt allow me to access it from the pdf so i had to google the routing number and look at a statement just to figure out what my account number is thats stupid now every time i try to sign in the app refuses to acknowledge my phone no matter how many times i sign in and activate the touchid that means that every single time i log into the app i have to request a new identification code this app is pushing me from just deleting it all together i cant use my card if it takes so long for me to simply log in and figure out what my recent transactions are one star fix your app chase,0
i love this apppay from my i phone check my balance without logging in get alerts when a charges are made on my card chase is always striving to improve their card and i appreciate that it is the only card i carry i have another card but do not carry it,0
this app will update more often than you use it it will make you login with your username and password before it refuses to help you and forces you to upgrade the app lame move chasetouchid is a joke you always have to enter your password there is no paste feature dont think you can swap between apps because it clears the password when you swap back so you better remember it all in one try you lame app user,0
app works ok with my iphone s but with my ipad i am constantly asked for a security code to sign in  i have a hard enough time remembering all sorts of passwords i dont need this extra hasslejust remember the ipad each time,0
this app continues to have glitches freezes and never recognizes my device regardless if i sign in everyday i still have to request an identification code in order to access my account the app is not worth it to have i have deleted it chase do better,0
compared to my other banking apps chase bank app is outdated it doesnt give you the option to use your fingerprint to log in and while it seems like a small thing that requires me to stop and head for cover to enter my   character passcode its obnoxious and is one of the main reasons ive been relying on my other apps more there should also be a quicker way to access quickpay it would be great if it emulated the pay apps like cashvenmo where its easy to use the app works fine and offers most if not all banking options through the app but its not as easy to use as other apps which is not to say that the app is hard to use,1
does mobile banking,0
great totally saved my butt while traveling abroad,0
this is one screwy bank that keeps you wondering what the heck is going on my charge account was created when i started my membership with amazon go figure i have an amazon credit card but the pmt center is chase all transactions do not show who or what the charge was made for i have it set up to pay my bill automatically in full it shows the withdrawal happening but there is always is a balance left behind of about  bucks and it is not a pending pmt go to the mail center and one can receive messages but not send them i often question if any execs are aware how asinine their system is reality is we are busy people that want to check their bill once a month and know the balance is paid off this is aggravation that i dont need,1
perfect,0
chases app is pretty efficient does what i need and nothing shy of it havent had to many glitches with it since i first downloaded it about two years ago i like the preview feature its relatively up to date with my transactions every time i reset or get a new phone this is one the first apps i download,1
wish it had more functionality could be improved if i could access more services offered at chasecom from the app,0
perfect,0
this app is very limited in what you can use it for will only allow payments for my chase freedom credit card not chase auto or mortgage have to log on to computer to make payments for those,0
we have been with chase for years ever since they took over bank one we over draft under  because they dropped a charge that we made and the bank charged    and we emailed them and has not gotten a response back as far as this app it would be nice if it was accurate,0
i think the app is as good as most of banks apps to quickly see accounts balances and do some simple transactions but i feel like i need to use too much the menu and select options instead of clicks on direct links doesnt invite me tu use it more and keeps sending me alerts that dont seem relevant for me,0
its great convenient and very helpful and its practically a necessity to assist me in keeping an eye on my finances and making payments on my chase credit card i couldnt get by without it,0
i can do my banking anywhere in a heartbeat  very easy to use  im able to do external transfers to my credit union which is a great plus i can pay my bills from my laptop and from my iphone  so far im very pleased  i really dont see why so many complaints its sometimes the sellers fault  for example amazon will sometimes charge you immediately but if there is a delayed delivery they will charge you when it is being shipped not when you really purchased it,0
awesome,0
every time i try to use this a app it says it doesnt recognize my device in other words my password touch id and all are completely irrelevant i have to request an identification code every single time cumbersome and annoyingif i didnt have other apps on my phone that dont have this problem to log in including banks and credit card providers i probably wouldve thought its my phones problem nope its the lame chase app,0
honestly this is the best bank and banking app they constantly keep it updated they only have the best and getting access to it is incredible wouldnt recommend anything else and wouldnt shy away from any praise,1
need fingerprint login option,0
i love this appit is easy to sign incheck my account to see my balance and make payments,0
it works,1
awesome,0
yes the app is for ipad but it never recognizes the device and i have to request an authorization code if i want to log in every time pain to use,0
cant set up banking payment information through the app must first set it up by calling customer service or going online to chasecom but you can only access chasecom from a computer not a phone  very inefficient these days you should be able to do everything from the appphone,0
randomly and very frequently forgets the touch id settings and then forces a login including requiring security code this occurs even within the same day and immediately after the settings have been updated and the security code entered does not happen just because of a reset or update of the system happens all the time randomly please fix,0
i am not able to go to the bank right now because i cannot drive  for some reason the check deposit stopped work on the app pain in the butt,1
good job,0
this app must have some sort of glitch my touch id setting is removed on its own every single time i try to log in i know its not my phone with the issue because my touch id works with all my other apps including the apple app store as soon as i try to open the chase app its says the touch id setting must be turned on again and when i try to login with my usual username and password and it says it doesnt recognize this mobile device ridiculous considering ive been using this app since i moved to chase this happens to me every single time i want to open this app ive even deleted it and downloaded again and it still happens so irritating and considering deleting this app from my iphone useless,1
this app ishas been absolutely amazing and helpful,0
i use this app almost daily to control my moneyit is easy to use and makes it easy to do when i am away from my computer,0
amazing,1
doesnt remember passwords wont let me authenticate without mobile verification but wont send the code worst piece of software,0
when i try to login it always says device not recognized when requested for id code it says service temporarily not available try againlooks like i need to try again for ever please fix it,0
awesome,0
love depositing checks online,1
every time i log on it says it does not recognize my device amp requires a security code even if i select remember me same message i might as well save page on my phone amp log on there,1
excellent app very very prompt in posting activity a great tool for managing my chase account,0
chase mobile app is very user freindlycolors are very pleasant,0
the fact that the chase app can be hacked in order to get a one time pin that can then be taken to any chase branch atm to withdrawal up to  at a time is absolutely ridiculous this happened to me was not believed by chase until the fbi took over my case i had to fight for over a month to get my money back until they fix or remove this feature i can in no way recommend this product,0
about  of the time the app cannot connect to chasecom there is supposed to be a deposit limit of  but the app has rejected deposits of half that amount which makes the check deposit feature nearly useless,0
the app never remembers my device especially when i update the app i have to get a verification code texted to me and relog in every time its so inconvenient and annoying,0
maybe im the only one that experiences this but it would be nice if touch id consistently worked when i go to settings its turned on but when i go to login it makes me use my username and password,1
my way out to young blueeyes girls and to charities angelsofthepoororg  foods for the poor amp programs gifts to poor children in the caribbean amp latin america and everything in between,1
perfect,1
 days after login app says it doesnt recognize this device and requires me to confirm identity with a new identification code same issue with touch id  days after enabling touch id doesnt work and app requires identification code other than that app works well,1
great app to see your charges monthly statementsand bill statement comes up pdf so you can print it out or send it email or textno issues here,0
the app has great functionality the annoyance is that it never recognizes my device when i log in requiring me to request and then type in a verification code every time i use the app i use it probably half as often as i would if this wasnt an issue,0
i wish it was integrated with lastpasscom but i understand why they may not want too does pretty much everything i want to do,1
why does it not ever keep my password or thumb print memorized always is in a reset state where i have to enter password twice and get a code as well why even tease us that we can use touch id yet alone a password,1
very practical app,1
i have had to rewrite this review because jpmchase has continued to improve the app to the point where it is the now the best banking app that i use the only fault is the inability to clear the notices fast see below the ability to glance at your accounts is back from being lost in the ios  update and the continuously updated versions getit is now easier to get more info more quickly which is what i use the app for most the developers have still not addressed the issue of clearing push notifications quickly that section is ridiculous having to page back and forth to find out which account has the most recent notification perhaps being able to sort the order of accounts would make it easier to see the most recent notifications and clear the stupid red balls from the icon,0
its a good app only complaints doesnt have pin code log in option and you cant access your credit score from the app,1
i can see my balance as well recent transactions very easily quick pay is a breeze and the people i send it to get the money almost instantly  definitely an improvement from previous versions,1
i love this app when it works but the app regularly tells me it doesnt recognize my device  it happens on two different accounts i sign in to and makes me get an id code by email or text  i put the code in and it lets me get into the account but if i close the app and then reopen it with the same account i just put the id in for it will again tell me it doesnt recognize device  tonight four times four failure to recognize four id codes four times opening the app three times i didnt try to reopen after fourth activity failure to recognize again  very frustratingupdate  i now give this five stars instead of two  above problem seems to be resolved  thank you  very convenient app to use,1
this app to my opinion offers a friendly way of banking the layout is great especially with all the updates that have been done plus it updates as needed  the way of doing transfers changes etc its user friendly and i will definitely recommend to download it if you have chase bank also if you havent tried the atm pin code to withdraw i strongly recommend it  its amazing stars,1
ever want to spend  minutes logging in to an app have you ever had an app not recognize your device every time you use it have you ever wanted to have a confirmation code texted to your device only to have the first  codes not work have you ever wanted to finally get logged into the app only to find out payments made  weeks ago never posted  have you ever wanted to now have to call and be on hold for  minutes because your payment wasnt processed have you ever wanted all these things to occur randomly and not always at the same time my god chase you should be embarrassed,1
i wish they can offer bank credit cards in the app                and a l weash are you will be able to add my credit card to apple pay from the app   just like discoverd  for the iphone   please so i can use it on my appel watch   other than that its a great app  thank you                        best ap for your banks           there is an opportunity for the apple watch  checking account             how soon can i use my apple watch at the a t m        and thank you so much for my favorite credit card  you are the best bank all around  thank so so much for all your hard work   one more thing     can you please add fico  score to the app thank you again one more thing how come there is no finger print touch id on the iphone ,0
wonderful app,1
continually getting a expected  got  error when trying to log in not being able to access my account is very stressful and frustrating please address this issue,0
ive only ever deleted this app once and when i did it fixed the logins for me it came back again where the app cant recognize my device and keeps asking me for a code that gets emailed to me pretty annoying to always have to do this tried to use touch id but kept giving me a message to sign in and activate it again which basically had no point in me using touch id,1
nearly everyday i use the app i always have to request an identification code i called chase about it and they said its a know issueabout a year ago they told me to uninstall and reinstall the app and reboot between those actions still broken before having to use an identification code touch id failed to pop up over half the time so i had to type in a very secure password every time for a giant company like chase youd think theyd fixed this by now,1
like many other people i am having trouble with having to create a new password or unlock my username every time i try to log into this app it used to work great but since the update it has been an inconvenience to log in especially when you are constantly on the go the touch id never works and every time i put in my password it tells me i have either tried too many times and i am locked out  despite it being my first time trying to log in or it will tell me it is the wrong password although i know for sure that it isnt and eventually it will lock me out due to too many failed attempts please fix this besides this i do like this app when it comes to transferring money or paying bills but it should not be this hard to log in,1
its imposible to know your real balance at a real time on weekends until  bss days latersad important and very competitive its what it is,1
when you delete a us eng keyboard and add a third party keyboard ex gboard there is no keyboard available on signin username password works fine however,1
i have never written a review of anything before im taking the time to do this because of this extremely frustrating problem with the chase mobile app ditto on the review dated  regarding multiple login problems i have also had to change my password about every other day for months i have tried the call center and they are clueless they told me this has never been reported before this app has been so convenient in every other way but having to change my password every couple of times that i use it is a major problem,1
app works decently when i can sign in without having to request a authentication code touch id repeatedly turns itself off and when i type my password it says it doesnt recognize me and i have to send a code to my phone that i have to enter with my password this has been going on for months and there have been at least a half dozen updates since the app has done this and still the same issues seems like they have no intention of fixing these issues next time i need a authentication im just gonna uninstall this crap,1
cant just log into it without having to request a security code it is so frustrating then under settings anytime i request the touch id it doesnt work either hate using this app,0
add the add outsource bank account feature in order for people to pay their credit card bill from the app i had to go through many google searches just to be able to add a bank account to my chase account in order to pay my credit card payment i had such a tough time trying to add an account online because when you type in chasecom it takes you to the mobile site and that specific site doesnt allow the option to add a checking account bank account to our chase account come on,1
have to request id code every time i try to access app because it does not recognize device this happened  minutes after i received a code logged off tried to log on and had to request another code also as others have said touch id turns itself off easier to use web,1
i love the app its perfect but i hate i absolutely hate that the app request for a id code at least  times a week i hate that the app takes my finger print out too this needs to be fixed,0
for a large bank you would think they would have their sht together where is the fingerprint login why are there so many updates why is the menu so limited,1
constant u must update or f u u cant use this is annoying understatement,0
unless there are breaking changes in the api which should never happen if your api is versioned or there are security issues theres no reason i should be forced to update the appthere are times when i need to see my balance and i have just enough data to pull my account balance and successfully log in not download a couple mb download star until that gets fixed it has caused me trouble several times,1
im amazed at how long a financial institution can leave out there a dysfunctional app you spend a ton of time typing a response to a secure message and at the end it errors out to send this then triggers a call to my phone at random times where they hand up as soon as you answer,0
after this last update i was able to login but the app would crash and not confirm payment yesterday after downloading and deleting the app x i apparently missed by deadline for payment due by hrs and was accessed a late fee although i made my payment through their app at pm pst would have been nice to get an option before making my payment that although i still had   hours before the end of the day due date  that if i used the app it would be considered a late paymentwhen i received an email at am today  saying i missed my payment needless to say i was concerned when inquiring with chase they did confirm that i did indeed make my payment on  because i missed the east coast cutoff time of pm est i was latethe explanation was that i could have called in the payment as they indicated this current release of their app has no technical issues really if that were the case my payment would have posted by pm pst pm est when i stated the processhorrible app phone it in pls,1
like most people im not checking my bank balance everyday so once a week or so i do and there is always an update please just let me see my account dont give a fk about minor bug fixes that have never once improved my experience,1
i did not want to update yet but chase required it in order to open the app previous version of this app was stars loved it i entered my username and password as usual and received an error message stating that there had been too many login attempts that was my very first attempt after updating the appso the app cant be used at all and since there is no chase bank in my state i am sitting in front of a pile of alreadysigned checks that cannot be cashed the chase app is the only way i was able to deposit into that account there is nothing to do but sit and wait for it to be fixed i have an iphone s w ios ,1
this app constantly makes the update before you can see any of your information also it doesnt tell you a lot  i want it to give you more information on your account  and if you want to make a payment and youre already signed in with you thumbprint you have to sign in again with your password and username i find everything about this app somewhat inconvenient and not so userfriendly,1
this app requires updates too often and you cant choose to do it at another time to add to my frustration it also forgets my pw too often and i have to request a code its hard to set up automatic payments for non chase accounts,1
chase please be serious on what you are doing  check deposit never works since the st version come out and now what still does not work please remove the app from appstore or fire whoever made this app and hire a new team to make it work chase  please show that you care about usthank you,1
the app works good enough once i get logged in but  of the time it wont let me use fingerprint login so i have to type in my password once i type in my password the app requires a code sent via textemail to let me in i could understand if this happened after weeks of not using but this has happened  or  times in the same day its getting to the point of ridiculous please fix this,1
touch id frequently doesnt work forcing you to enter your username and password and worse often times i am asked to reset my password after many failed attempts even though i only attempted to login once and i know i entered the correct login information  i have had to update my password many many times and it is very frustrating  please fix these two issues,1
functionally it fine and ease of use is no issue but what the f why does app every  days require a change of password this is massively annoying especially since you setup touch id fire whomever provided the last dozen updates and have not figured this out going to bank of america peace,0
you need to fix it again after the update this morning the app does not realize my account so i have to request secure code each time i have to log in fix the issue please,1
so if you want to do basic things like look at your bouncer transfer some money this is great for itor if you want to go and set some alerts to automatically alert your iphone have a certain amount has been spent or if youre below a certain amount its also great for that ,1
makes handling money very simple and easy keep an eye on everything thanksupdate ive updated this app every time it is available i have never had an issue signing in fingerprint log in is useless since you cant access your accounts without password anyways still no problems even after latest update  yes there will be times when it is unavailable they fore worn you and it is always on a weekend people need to check their settings and stop complaining this is a top quality banking app,1
what the f is going on with the quick deposit why is my account greyed out and does not allow me to make check deposits ridiculous,1
there are no directions how to use the atm access code it is an digit code and it was not clear where to input it atm kept providing an error message terrible experience,0
the app requires you to continue reactivating your touch id amp its pretty annoying once i op to use the touch id it shouldnt keep turning it off and making me reenter my password and sending me an identification code fix please,1
terrible app i use this ipad to access my account several times per week but my device is never recognized  so i have to get an access code each time i want to open my account today the direction was to press pound to continue but when i did the direction kept on recycling no access is terribly frustrating help,1
i like the fingerprint feature to login in or the lock code feature makes it easy and quick to log in,0
i am not sure how come the reviews are so poor but this app works fine on my iphone i use it to deposit checks online and to review my account balance i also used to have an android and the app worked fine last year as well,1
i have been using this app for about two years and it has been working great for me first on android and now on iphone no problems at all and very convenient,1
because i dont like when you deposit money or check stay pending for a lot of daysit say that you dont have money when you ready have a deposit i dont like how it show the balance in the credits cards is confusing ,1
very helpfulll ,0
the app is convenient to use wish i could view checks in the iphone app as in ipad app also it doesnt seem to recognize my iphone despite repeated verification code entries nuisance issue,1
its annoying  coz most of the time i need to get a code  specially if you put the apps in to two phone,1
not touch idand it is  wow just wow but my fingerprint sign in on android works what gives,0
it crashes more often in android than ios but very slow and constantly timing out you would expect a decent app from a giant like chase,0
for ultimate rewards show a total of pending rewards just like chasecom does,0
used this app to keep tabs on my balances made sure i use it before any purchases especially as i get close to end of month checked available balance paid it with my card and then got  overdraft fee chase customer service said dont use the app for checking your balancehuh,0
pretty good,0
many are complaining this app doesnt work well w android thats because nothing works well w android i finally bought an iphone  and all my apps now work beautifully my favorite feature is touchid login works perfectly everytime been on this app for  years now the bomb,0
how many times to i have to verify this app to access my information  answer everyday  requires a code to be sent to email phone or text  so much protection until its a pain in the butt  good check deposit function  okay but needs improvement,0
once you work through all of the kinks its not too difficult to pay your bill but in the beginning it is quite difficult i have a nother credit card that i use and it is quite easy to pay usually only takes about three swipes of my finger and im done ive also had to reset my password about  times in the last three weeks it could definitely use some work on the app but other than that its not too bad i would give it maybe a six out of  just need some work and it will be good as gold make it more userfriendly,0
nice app but on my android i can use touch id to opennot on apple which is my work device other than that real easy to send quick pay transfers and review your balance i can also pay my credit card as well,0
easy easy easy user friendly appeverything is clean allows me to do everything i need to do in an expeditious manner in my iphonei would know because i have managed a few other banks apps and chase gives me the most useful tools on a mobile devicegreat job developers,0
like it very much and i call it banking on the go at my fingertips to check balances statements do payments and find branch locations it does the work with finger print or code access,0
great app it works for me,0
first rate,0
i love being able to check my amazon balance on this app but the main issue is that there is not a running balance like i have with my bank of america app that showsdebit   running balance all this app shows are debits and there is no way i can track back the exact amounts i am balancing my personal checkbook along with numerous other credit cardswhen i called support they told me i had to log into the online account on a computer to see the running balance,0
its easy to use all your accounts are therefor you to see easy to perform money transfers or payments quick notifications of transactions easy log in and log out also idle time log off if case you forget keeping your accounts secured yes there is a learning curve at the beginning but its not rocket science or breaking rocks if i can learn to use it so can you even if youre brain dead like me dont forget to tap the friendly banking staff for help like they say  were here to help you any time you need us its not hard its simplesaves you time,0
i use this app every day however i havent used the newest feature yet where i can now access select atms with a code in case i dont have my bank card i think this is a great option to have,1
pros  once logged in i can click on each of my accounts and see activity details i have not tried making a payment via the app recently bc the process of reentering my payment info was too annoying i decided to accomplish that using the desktop portal cons  logging in logging in logging in  i have set my touch id at least  times and every time i try go back to login not only does the touch id not pop up as an option but im then forced to go through getting an identification code every time you loose me immediately and i dont continue on to the app i think that the team is slowly making improvements however it has been too slow for the powerhouse banking entity that it is the interface needs a lot of work whoever is designingtesting it needs to put on the hat of the end user  people that just need to be able to find their banking information and processes as quickly and efficiently as possible,0
touch log in always turning off and i have to receive a code all the time fix it,1
compared to other banking apps ive used this one could use come work when it comes to convenience it would be nice to have a pin code feature or a thumbprint access feature instead of typing your password every time other than that no technical issues runs smooth havent noticed and big flaws,0
totally happy with app and the ease of getting into my accountslove this app,1
best banking app there iseverything runs smooth and quick,1
ive been using this app for both ios and android for years now its easy to see that chase has invested heavily in their applications these past couple of years as far as depository applications go this app is pretty seamless in getting the job done with push notifications full banking functionality and quick load times there is always room for improvement and i would like to see some decoupling of this app so they can focus more heavily on the most utilized functionality,0
i havent had issues with the app i only use it for my chase credit card which i got through amazon so i cant comment on any banking transactions overall its a great app for credit cards,1
awesome,1
update   no improvement in alert badging on the plus side in app deposit limits have increasedupdate   no improvement to alert badging the app is badged with one to four alerts each week and when i go to alerts in the app it pulls up a credit card account which has never had a message and at the same time clears the alert badges when i touch to see all accounts none are bashed so i have to open each of my  accounts to try and find the new alert chase please fix this otherwise it is adequate and works okupdate   still hate the way alerts are badged no improvement here at all with credit cards i have  accounts to go through looking for a recent alert still a paini like most features of the app and the addition of touchid is welcome the big grip i have is alerts the app badges the alerts but when you try to view them there is no indication of which account sent the alert i have  checking a savings and  credit cards and have to check each until i find the alert even worse just going to view alerts clears the alert badge making it hard to even determine if you have found them all,0
i constantly have to get an authorization code for my phone annoying,1
still a great app they keep adding nice to have features even without me asking im reminded every time i go to cash a check at bofa how much better chase is as a bank theres always a monstrous line at bofa with  tellers trying to work through it chase never has a line and their new fancy atms are almost as good as a teller more transaction details would be awesome thanks for making touchid more reliable i was a wamu customer when chase took over several years ago wamu had been a good bank so i was a bit concerned since bofa and wells fargo are so bad and chase was the other big bank but chase has been great work often requires me to interact with other banks and chase is head and shoulders better in banking and app making,1
does its job easy to pay off my amazon cc see my balance etc,0
love it very professionally design and helpful thank you so must keep up the good work staff and designers and people of all interested into this are truly professionals your professional staff and technicians and design teams have really done a great  job in pursuing and keeping up this app and made it a lot easier to do what i need to do thank you so much october   super great out love it thank you keep up the good work this app has got much better with a lot of availability is to allow me to research and do things thats beneficial thank you you guys are done a  professional jobjune awesome application i enjoy all the use of this app also appreciated that i am able to use fingerprint id two exes and all the protection coverage you guys in stored to help me keep my account healthy chase you have out done yourself and all your employees and professionalism that yall have put into this app and your business thank you so much for keeping me safe in my accountgreat app i love what it let me do an allowed me to get to in a timely manner april awesome out and go all of peters and the things that allow me to do with my account and opportunities to the sky getting outstanding i love it thank you so much,0
i cant log into my account touch id doesnt work and when i tried typing in my password which i did correctly and it said there were too many login attempts and asked me to reset my password please fix this broken piece of sht of an app,1
since they shove the app down your throat i dont see much choice but to tolerate it no matter how lousy it may look or function but i appreciate that the bulk of ugliness is likely security concerns and that is very important to me,1
use the amazon prime rewards card by chase on this app good fast amp reliable app for quick access to basic credit card features like account activity payments hope they improve the ui though been the same for a long time now,1
awesome awesome awesome,1
i downloaded the app a few weeks ago after having just signed in to chasecom in the past i really wish the app would rotate to landscape view on the ipad i have an attached keyboard amp its frustrating to have to turn the ipad to portrait view to read the info then back to landscape to work in the app with the keyboard while reading it as its at a  degree angle,1
works exactly as it should comes with sms support for immediate updates works well with funds transfer and payment scheduling i use it with my amazon visa and it also keeps track of all my associated points well done,1
only thing i hate about this app is that my touch id gets turned off every time theres a new release or even at random times i have to log in get an access code and put my password in a couple times to get in and turn touch id back on very irritating i see others complaining about this and the fact it isnt yet fixed is incredible,1
dependable banking app,1
very handy   locations of atms is a timesaver   alerts are fantastic  mobile banking is very convenient needed identification code multiple times when using my only ipad not convenient when  minutes to login password then fill out where to send identification code get identification code password   i deleted ,1
not able to set up auto pay from app not set up to use finger print for sign on will have to cancel my chase credit cards sorry amazon,0
apple has had fingerprint recognition technology for several years now many banks have written this into the code sure would be a nice feature and i wouldve given five stars,0
i can do deposit at anytime from checkchecking balance paying bill whether make glad,0
ive been using the app ever since it started the biggest pp is that when it gets updated it changes  most of the changes are good but some of them are confusing my biggest problem is when i make a transfer taking from one account to the other accountbut sometimes it mixes them upmaking it a little frustrating i wiped out my savings account one time instead of taking for my checking account and taking it from my savings account andi didnt notice the difference until later when i was below my minimum balance level,1
annoyed asking for identification code all the time i want to log in saying  does not recognize my device why i log in with the same device for a year and i even have  remember me box checked but every time i want to log in using the app it does not recognize my device whats the point of downloading his app so annoying you should do better ,1
i find it useful for when i want to look at my acct balance quickly and easily plus having another on the acct helps me keep track of my spending without having to login every time i want to see my balance this just to add to my above comment very timely with updates and saving time on knowing my balance so because of it keeps me on track without any problems of over drafts thanks for the app chase will always be my banking choice,0
everything for the most part is great downside not all my credit cards show up in the app my wife and i share a amazon prime credit card which is through chase and we are both on the account but only she can see not me given that everything else works as normal and couldnt be happier especially since now you can get your account number from within the app where before it was only through the web app,1
app does just enough to provide the balance and transaction history however the constant issues with the app not recognizing my touch id andor password has gotten a bit old and tiresome youll properly setup all the login options and within a few days the app will not recognize me anymore and will force me to receive another security code via text and ask me to setup my login info again and this only happens with this app all of the other apps i use that require passwords and touch id only need to be setup once and never need to be reset again it literally only happens with this chase appand it has been happening for well over a year now but hey other than that the app does what its supposed to doprovide your account and balance information,0
every time theres an update i have to start over meaning that i have to reset my touch id and passwordits very frustrating it shouldnt be a feature if i must reset it every time,1
they still havent fixed push notifications for iphone  come on chase american expresss app works great every time i use my card a notification pops up on my phone please bring this back chase,1
very convenient,1
awesome,1
great app i love it,1
very good banking app+works great nearly every time i need to log in  fast only problem is sometimes i will get a message that may say i had  messages from chase and when i log in to go look i find no unread messageslook if you have a message for me just send it why prompt me to log in to only find none waiting,1
i love this version because with the touch of my thumb im logged in no more username or password to rememberand theres more comprehensive information about my accountbut i dont know why other people say they have to use touch id and enter their password because i dont,1
perfect,1
this problem has been going on for months with several updates but nothing has fixed the problem i use touchid and it rarely lasts longer than a week and usually only a few days before im locked out and my password is no longer accepted at first i went through all of the password reset functions but i ran out of passwords to dream up after changing dozens of times and they dont let you reuse passwords for months i used to call in nearly every time i logged in and they would just unlock my account so i could log in again but last time they refused and forced me to change my password but the code they gave me wouldnt work and the online methods for changing passwords also dont work basically this app is completely useless i see many others having the same problems for months and no solutions have been offered they once told me to delete and reinstall the app and promised that would fix it they lied it didnt fix anything,0
its disappointing that this does not have a fingerprint enable option i have an amazon branded chase credit card and the options within the app also seem very basic and outdated,0
amazing,1
cjxtziydtdkso,0
this app does the trick shows me everything i need to see my bank information is all compressed in digital files after entering my username and password i can enter the network and account for my expenses there are a few functions i am unfamiliar with because i have not explored them well that seems obvious but it is all i have to offer,0
good app but the design and access for the amazon rewards card is limited and basic,1
its what you would expect from a large bank boa wellsworks  most of the time good on security,1
 of the time the app doesnt even let you log in i am constantly having to go to chasecom to use the mobile site if i want to do anything with my bank account the app is useless because being temporarily unavailable is a regular occurrence so im deleting the app its a waste of space on my phone,0
login gt connect with chase gt help and support gt contact us gt any of the options eg  personal credit cards gt popover with number + gt tap on callno call takes placeremedy  change number format to +  thank me later,0
a+++++++++++++++++++++++++++,1
chase used to have one of the best banking web sites and mobile apps in recent months things have gone south so fast that im evaluating other options for my primary bankaccount lockouts now happen several times a month because anyone can lock an account without knowing a users password they need only throw a few bad password guesses at it god forbid you have a common username why cant chase follow the common practice of allowing a few extra login attempts from devices that have been seen before this stops this wrongheaded security measure from turning into a dos attack on accountsrepeated automated attempts to access accounts with the mobile app or mint will also lock your account if they happen during bank maintenance windows when login fails the mobile app incorrectly tells you your password is wrong you wont know the real problem unless you call chase or try the full website where error messages are more helpful but still incompletethe full website requires your social security number and an account number to unlock the account it wont let you paste these out of a password manager you have to type your account number manually each time which ive been through so often now that i have it memorized then the site presents an option to unlock the account without changing the password this never works forcing one to go back and retype your account number etc a second or third time to receive a text and generate a new passwordits gotten to where i have to go through this nuissance a couple times a month chase has chosen burdensome security practices over other banks equally secure but less burdensome practices unlike my other bank accounts my chase account is no longer something i can rely on without frequent manual maintenance,0
its okay for basic things like paying bills but you cant even manage your messages without logging into a computer and i have to put in a code every time i log in with my phone annoying,1
top notch app highlights how far behind chasecom is,1
thedogfather said it best  i agree with that review,1
grrrrrrrrreat,1
advertise that you can check your credit score then make you log in  times to say username not available which is the same as my banking name enter in new user info sorry user already exist no button to find out user name i hate chase,1
in my area code  the app shows nearest chase atms problem is the first one was an empty and closed building the second one was a chase atm but is no longer and it has not been updated in a long time and i got charged a fee by the atm and then chase rd one was not there either and when depositing checks the screen will turn sideways for a picture of the check but not when your typing the amount so u cant touch the lower screen buttons until you hit done,1
used to be a good app i assume a security setting got changed several months ago where every time you try to log in on a mobile device it doesnt recognize it and locks you out whether you type in the correct password or not the first few times was annoying but i thought it was me started being super careful with inputting and keeping track of the password its not me its you please fix it now you have had several monthsupdate yup locked me out again despite using the correct password on my usual device you really should fix this after all it is keeping me from giving you money,1
i really like this app when i first installed it however in the past month its asked me to reset my password because of to many failed logins normally that would be understandable except it happened when i launched the app without even entering any info customer service was able to bypass the reset and even acknowledge the lack of failed attempts but could not provide any reason why it happenednow if that issue wasnt enough i am constantly having to go into the settings and re activate the touch id feature just last week i did that on four separate days truth is im only writing this review because it did it to me today monday  and had the nerve to ask for my opinion,0
touch id no longer works  as of  check deposits no longer work would give zero stars if i could figure out how hope the bank tellers wont be rude today chase took over my local bank not sure if they even care,1
i give it five stars because it does everything i expect it to doeasy access with touch id rarely ever with any issues mostly when my hands are cold  pay bills extremely convenient   its mostly always available when i beed it,0
why is there no way to contact them through the app you must be on an actual computer to start a new message but i cannot access the internet on my computer and i currently cannot make calls trying to reply to an old message is the only way to message via the app but it just gives an error and wont send this app is useless,1
only after trying to log in does a popup come up saying this device a s plus isnt supported and to use the website instead i feel like this is old enough to be supported by now and even if the developers cant figure out how to scale the interface why make me look up my password get a text message pin code and input it and then put in my password again before telling me,0
for the past month i probably changed my password   times as the app kept telling me that i have so many attempted login and need to change my password again wth i ran out of password ideas anymore,0
its aaaiiigghhht,1
i love this bank it has saved my butt more than once i like that they work with you ,1
this app review writing feature stinks instead of allowing the reviewer to modify its nickname it automatically deletes your review and makes you start over some geniuses must have really thought long and hard on engineering that code,1
this app works great  percent of the time only a couple of times did the remote deposit of checks not work and i had to take the checks to the bank,0
this app constantly works perfectly on my sisters samsung phone but on my iphone  i would try to use touch id they say i have to do it manually then i put in the correct code after doing that once they say ive exceeding my password attempts every time this forces me to log into my computer and change my password i really need this fixed because i am putting in the correct password and it denies me after once chance fix the glitch please,0
it makes you update to the latest version after you enter your password and then you have to enter it again as if typing on a phone wasnt painful enough then it doesnt recognize the phone and you have to type a two factor code and type your password again since i use the app less often than it updates i expect ill have to enter three passwords and an auth code every time i use it,1
love this app and love my amazon rewards visa card makes everything very convenient and i always know what my balance is and i love the automatic payment feature,1
this app works great for what i need to get done on both my iphone and android devices however the app lacks the ability to use the phones biotechnology like the finger print scanner to login just like citibank and bank of america apps the chase app need to play catch up because now new technology is about to start like retina scanning and the chase app is still stuck on passwords please update this and youll get more stars from me and others,1
this app i find easy to use and understand i love itat times when update comes through theres a bug or two but i have no real complaints,0
great app but frequently doesnt recognize my iphone so have to constantly request identification code even when ive used the app on my phone earlier on the day more annoying than anything otherwise the app is great,0
slow and investment module very awkward with inadequate feedback not in same ballpark with fidelitycom,0
and always improving,0
after many months of problems as described below we may finally have a fix for the log in issues a customer service rep advised me that if you have an old username which doesnt conform to updated requirementsie includes letters and numbers you will keep getting locked out and be forced to change your password why they dont tell you this and require you to change your username instead of repeatedly locking you out and forcing a password change i have no ideaold reviewover the past four months or so ive been forced to change me password almost  times  the touch id option turns itself off pretty much every other time i log in so i decided to leave it off now that im back to a text password the problem persists i just entered the correct password which i know is correct bc i have it written down it tells me i have too many attempts to log in and locks my account this is on the first log in attempt i called support about this a month or two ago and they told me to delete the app and redownload well that hasnt worked now there are other reviews on here with people having the same problem please fix it,1
awesome,0
im really disappointed i only use this a couple times a month and it seems like every time i want to use it i have to reverify my device even though i set up the fingerprint scanner it never keeps the setting the last two attempts i had to reverify my device get the id code enter it and then the app tells me it cant retrieve the account information poor qa poor implementation my wells fargo app works great,1
i dont have to buy amazon cards anymore but now i can use my chase account its also really easy i keep checking my account almost everyday takes less than  seconds,1
the app has great features however it took me  tries to reset my password bc it kept freezing on the enter identification code screen then when i would get back to that screen after restarting the app it would say that my code was not valid so i would have to request a new code by text and the whole cycle would restart  frustrating,0
when you try to login for the first time it asks you for a verification code it offers to send you a six digit  code but that code does not work  i had to call chase and after verifying my identity they sent me a nine digit code which did let me into the appthe only reason i opened this account was to be able to deposit foreign checks the app only allows me to deposit in us dollars so it is worthless to me that doesnt make it worthless to everyone else but its frustrating that i have to drive to the bank to deposit checks like its ,0
every time i need to update the app i must first enter my username and password to find out the app requires an update then i update and enter my username and password a second time what an aggravation the should tell me when i open it that an update is required,1
save lot of timeno worry to drive in to deposit check,1
the app keeps crashing every time i try to long in it keeps saying that it looks connection  it used to be good until now ,1
